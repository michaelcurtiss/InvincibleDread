Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s motivations did not become clear until that afternoon, when she took the opportunity to hide behind Mandri\u8217\'92s ragged figure to sneak sips of wine. She kept this up for a whole hand. By the time the sun was drawing down, her mind was scrambling to triage her body\u8217\'92s functions. Trivial things like the drool dribbling down her chin were ignored so that she could focus on settling slosh of her stomach bile. Whenever it rose and burned her throat she\u8217\'92d twist to try and vomit it into the sand. Nothing but spittle ever came out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Beautiful,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered to himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Eh?\u8221\'94 Seb belched.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The landscape, it\u8217\'92s beautiful.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s half-lidded eyes turned to the world beyond and she immediately forgot the possibility that Mandri had just insulted her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1   \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s juss sand,\u8221\'94 she croaked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s more than that, isn\u8217\'92t it? It\u8217\'92s sand, sure, but it\u8217\'92s also\u8230\'85it\u8217\'92s an empty canvas for the colors of the setting sun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hah!\u8221\'94 Seb laughed before burping a hiccup. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s sand, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 sure}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 , but it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s also a place to piss.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I suppose\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Piss!\u8221\'94 Seb shouted. \u8220\'93Piss floodin\u8217\'92 the runnels! Why else ain\u8217\'92t nothin\u8217\'92 grows out here? Whole Sand been pissed on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She leaned back, burped, and sneered the sight of a soiled world. Mandri wondered if she were imagining a great flash flood of golden piss spreading down from the north.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe Sol, maybe Schisol,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93He stood on tha saddle of the slaveback mountains, He pissed, an\u8217\'92 it flowed allllllll the waaaaaaay to here.\u8221\'94 She followed the slur of her words to the bottom of a long dried wash and jumped in it. Her balance was remarkable considering her state, only a slight wobble. Then she wrested one last sip of wine from her wine skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I presume it kept going?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked as she gave a satisfactory smack of her lips.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The piss. It didn\u8217\'92t stop here, did it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No! To the sea!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Isn\u8217\'92t that a little much? No god needs a continental drainage system to\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you think it\u8217\'92s more likely to have been rain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93These channels, don\u8217\'92t you think they were carved by\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stopped himself because Seb, distracted by a bout of nausea, started to sway away from him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This was the problem with deep drunkenness; it promised entertainment but few could handle the charm of it. Seb couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t handle it. She swallowed down a burp of rising bile and her face bore the fixity of a woman in great distress. She was about to piss herself. Or, and there was a chance of this, Mandri had underestimated her and she was thinking intently about life\u8217\'92s greatest mysteries, whereby she\u8217\'92d begin to ramble about a thing which seemed clear and obvious to her, and only her, and only at this precise moment.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri watched and waited for a puddle of urine to spread around her feet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When that didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t happen, he began to hope she was privately elucidating. He knew he couldn\u8217\'92t ask her what she was thinking because the next sound he made would snap that delicate thread which keeps a thought steady in a drunk\u8217\'92s mind, and then it\u8217\'92d be on to the next thing. Whatever she was thinking would either come out her mouth in a projectile stream of consciousness, or it wouldn\u8217\'92t come out at all. It was a bit like waiting for a blessing from Sol. Mandri knew better than to ask for, or expect, such a blessing. To do so would defeat the joy of a blessing, which is supposed to elicit surprise and wonder. A blessing must rain down unexpected like the chromatic mist of a noon-sun shower.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Not that anything like that would happen here, where the landscape was dry and desolate. In some distant age it might have been full of potential. Who or what had spoiled it was impossible to say\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it certainly wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t godpiss. It wasn\u8217\'92t the Hrks either. Before the Hrks, this part of the Pitted Portion belonged to the Igomen. Perhaps they had ravaged it when tore it away from the Eastern Rotzi kings, who themselves had stolen it from the Rotzi proper.  Perhaps it was the Rotzi\u8217\'92s fault. It is believed that they were barbarians who chewed at the borders of the Pitted Portion for a thousand years before ripping the whole thing away from the Sheldri. The stories of the Sheldri do not acknowledge any of this, but this disavowal is not informative because the Sheldri do not acknowledge any of Jandri\u8217\'92s histories to be accurate. They deny even that the Pitted Portion exists. To Sheldri eyes the \u8220\'93Pitted Portion\u8221\'94 is a fabrication that was forcibly carved into something more fundamental. However, there are older Old Jandri traditions that even the Sheldri cannot refute.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The elder kings of Gom cast a long shadow on this place.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If they were the first humans here, then, presumably, they had stolen this land from the lizards.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And the Lizards?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d stolen the land, too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Stolen from whom, or what, was impossible to say, but they must have stolen it. Only a tender-hearted fool would think that a lizard should have rights where a man does not. All the creatures of the world are invaders and despoilers. This, in part, justifies the herding and killing of them; cow, pig, and poke alike. But if, for the sake of argument, they weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t guilty, then all involved were innocent, men included, and the true sinner here was the feminine aspect of nature, that temptress, that whore who calls out to every wandering man who dreams he his master of his own destiny.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Very little of this historical account was likely true, but the prospect of a thing being false rarely stopped anyone from reaching conclusions. It is enough that there is explanatory power, and much like Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pissing god, likening this landscape to an abused woman explained why it was what it was\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a gray, craggy, almost syphilitic desert, with dried riverbeds resembling old stretch scars scabbed over with salt, and dark swells of sand splotching its shoulders like contusions. It explained why this wilderness was barren for as far as Mandri could see, and why there was no allure left in it whatsoever. It must have had it coming. Why else would Sol refuse to intervene?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you looking at?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothin\u8217\'92,\u8221\'94 Seb lied through a limp-lipped drawl. She stood still as a statue, and her eyes were fixed on a bank of the wash near enough to Mandri\u8217\'92s feet. Hers was no longer a drunken, inward, sightless staring, she was looking }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 at}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  something, perceiving it, perhaps wondering what it was. All Mandri could see was that she was beholding something that he was not. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Was it something on the ground? In the ground? Related in some way to shape of the ground itself?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He kicked the ground near the spot of Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s interest, and this sent a spray of sand out at her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Stop it!\u8221\'94 Seb barked, though her sight did not waver from that point of ground. \u8220\'93Back off! No, git marchin\u8217\'92! We s\u8217\'92posed to be marchin\u8217\'92!\u8221\'94}
