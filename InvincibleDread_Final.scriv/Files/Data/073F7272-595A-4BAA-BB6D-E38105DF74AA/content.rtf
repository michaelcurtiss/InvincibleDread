\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 By 1905, Bryan had concluded that Darwinism and the modernism of Higher Criticism were allies in promoting liberalism within the church, thereby in his view undermining the foundations of Christianity. In lectures from 1905, Bryan spoke out against the spread of Darwinism, which he characterized as involving "the operation of the law of hate \endash  the merciless law by which the strong crowd out and kill off the weak", and warned that it could undermine the foundations of morality.}{ }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Now that Bryan had linked Darwinism and Higher Criticism as the twin evils facing the Presbyterian Church, Harry Emerson Fosdick responded by defending Darwinism, as well as Higher Criticism, from Bryan's attack.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Although the prosecution of Scopes was successful, the trial is widely seen as a crucial moment in discrediting the fundamentalist movement in America, particularly after Darrow called Bryan to the stand and he appeared little able to defend his view of the Bible.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Among the media, Bryan's loudest and ultimately most influential critic was\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._L._Mencken"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 H.\~L.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 As noted earlier, opposition to Darwinism was always much more important to Bryan than it was to other conservative Presbyterian Church leaders. Thus, following Bryan's death in 1925, the debate about evolution, while it remained an issue within church politics, never again assumed the prominence to the debate that it had while Bryan was alive. (Probably the reason why the issue of evolution has obtained such an iconic status within the popular consciousness about the fundamentalist\endash modernist controversy is that it represented the one point where internal church politics intersected with government, specifically public school, policy.)}
