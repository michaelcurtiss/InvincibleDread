To a man and woman, they want Hrk destroyed. And you\u8217\'92re a Mazid. You possess the most destructive power known to man. They captured you because they want to use you against your masters. That\u8217\'92s why Ayram was so upset when his girl couldn\u8217\'92t control you.\u8221\'94}

These Ayramun aren\u8217\'92t in a position to accommodate a freeloader, so I don\u8217\'92t understand why they would haul you around, or why they brought you back from the dead in the first place.\u8221\'94}
