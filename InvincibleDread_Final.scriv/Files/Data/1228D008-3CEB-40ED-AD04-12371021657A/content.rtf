He made some attempt to explain tendencies in prices, and to attempt to explain the (at the time assumed to be inherently real) tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Obviously, we've stopped attempting to solve the diamonds-and-water paradox by saying "one has more X involved in it, thus it is more valuable", so this was a largely defunct line of intellectual inquiry.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Overall, his work doesn't really influence modern econ, but people who were influenced by Marx were behind some interesting models and advancements, and modern concepts of monopsonistic labour markets definitely have some of their origins in those people.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In my line of research, I found more than 90% of published papers to be either nonesense, repeating the known in a different way, or even outright academic fraud in some cases. You often find "paper gangs"... A group of people who cite each others papers repeatedly and even review each other in lower quality publications with no "associations" checks! There is very little value in most of the published papers I encounter. This makes doing research a very difficult endeavour for me. I think the main reason for this is "publish or perish" situation in academia. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A very brave video containing a lot of truth. Few people dare to say this, although many true researchers feel and think it. Publishing a scientific product has become a business model. I visited the ATLAS Experiment at CERN and made the following observations: 1. One of the top authors has published 1,816 papers. If one's professional career lasts 40 years, the calculation says: 40 years X 365 days = 14600 days; 14600 / 1816 = 8 days to publish a paper That means 1 paper is published every 8 days during the entire professional life! That's about 45 papers a year... every year! 2. The same author has an h-index of 167. "The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given author/journal has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times." The top author has 167 papers each one cited 167 times! 3. A paper published by researchers had 78 authors! I realize that CERN is something "big" and quite complex. But... there are 78 authors anyway... Probably all those people are high-level scientists. But... what makes them hyperprolific? Is it real? How is it possible? Is it more for the benefit of science or is it a kind of business? }
