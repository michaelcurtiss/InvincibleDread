\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Third, it's not that atheists reject otherwise convincing evidence on a technicality. We reject evidence that is rational to reject and that everyone rejects when it's not about their particular set of beliefs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 If beauty, meaning, experience, and all the things you listed were valid evidence, we'd have to accept all religions as true, even when they say contradictory things (and no, perennialism doesn't solve this, as perennialism believes that religions share some truths, not that they are all true.) This "evidence" would prove even atheism, as an atheist can reasonably claim that there is beauty and meaning in rational skepticism.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Now, to your question. Humanity is valuable because it's valuable to us. Yes, it's subjective, but subjective doesn't mean random. Subjective values are what we live for. Love is clearly subjective - you and I don't love the same people - but we would die for our spouses and children.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 The ocean was very flat - no big rolling swells - just tiny little ripples. The whole world would be black, and then there would be a flurry of bolts, and the whole world would be silver. The ocean looked like nothing so much as aluminium foil that had been scrunched up, and flattened out - the water looked like mercury, and all the little ripples made these very dramatic black shadows.}
