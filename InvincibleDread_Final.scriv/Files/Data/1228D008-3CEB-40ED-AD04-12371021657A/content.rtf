He made some attempt to explain tendencies in prices, and to attempt to explain the (at the time assumed to be inherently real) tendency of the rate of profit to fall.

If one's professional career lasts 40 years, the calculation says: 40 years X 365 days = 14600 days; 14600 / 1816 = 8 days to publish a paper That means 1 paper is published every 8 days during the entire professional life! That's about 45 papers a year... every year! 2. The same author has an h-index of 167. "The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given author/journal has published at least h papers that have each been cited at least h times." The top author has 167 papers each one cited 167 times! 3. A paper published by researchers had 78 authors! I realize that CERN is something "big" and quite complex. But... there are 78 authors anyway... Probably all those people are high-level scientists. But... what makes them hyperprolific? Is it real? How is it possible?

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well that\u8217\'92s simple,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93Actually, the solution was in your grasp just now, but true to form you\u8217\'92ve squandered the opportunity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Out with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could capture a Riga after it has whistled the pseudospark out of my body, then you could walk wherever you please unmolested. You would then wake me once you reached your destination.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb stood up and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wait a finger\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 are you saying that we could have\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram waved Seb off, but Mandri answered her anyway. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, you could have carried me and my poor cousin around the Sand free from the worry of the Hrkan hunt. Or, you could end all difficulties by giving me a Spark.\u8221\'94 He mounted his argument before anyone had time to laugh. \u8220\'93One distant whistle from a Mazidariga will end me. If I had my own shard of the divine, then it stands to reason that I would be freed from the Mazidariga\u8217\'92s influence entirely.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Free from the hunt,\u8221\'94 Ayram muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet added, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Freed from a Minder as well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93But if you give me a Spark, you would be giving me my freedom. I said it before and it will always be true\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in return for such a gift, I would slay anything you wished.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me, creature, if a true Spark danced in your belly, what would stop you from killing us? What would stop you from violating your word?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothing,\u8221\'94 Mandri admitted.}}
