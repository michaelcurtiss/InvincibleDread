\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 For people not into cooking, a roux is a 1:1 by mass mixture of flour and fat that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cooked (to reduce the flour-y flavor) and used as a thickener. You do have to be careful about how you integrate it with liquids, just dumping everything together will cause it to not incorporate and you\u8217\'92ll end up with lumpy or gritty texture. It's a VERY VERY VERY common cooking tool, in both French and other cuisines. Three of the five "mother sauces" (sauces from which all other sauces in french cuisine are traditionally derived) use roux as a key ingredient. Dismissing everybody that uses roux is like... I dunno, being a visual artist and claiming that everybody who uses paint is an idiot.}

AFAIK you can\u8217\'92t truly fix this once the sauce is broken, but you could disguise it.}
