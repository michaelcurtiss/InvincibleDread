\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Transcriber's note:\line }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \line My name is on the cover, but I did not write this book. My name is on the cover for two reasons. First, the true author wished to remain anonymous, and would, I believe, eschew any association with this work. The reason for this will become clear soon. Suffice to say, there is no harm being done to him. The second reason my name is on the cover is that the publisher refused to publish unless my name was on the cover. They claimed legal reasons, though those reasons were, and are, impenetrable to me. I didn't push back on this because, honestly, I didn't care to. Of course, the true reason my name is on the cover is that names are brands, and brands sell. It might be presumptuous, at this point in my career, to call my name a brand as I've only written one other book*. But every brandname must start somewhere.\line \line So, with this arrangement forced on me, I have decided to include my own thoughts and reactions to the transcribed text as footnotes and standalone chapters, so as to excuse having my name on the cover. These interjections may be removed and the source material published as a standalone work. I would not object, so long as I am dead and the copyright on this work has expired. I do, after all, live in a society which everywhere encourages making name for oneself, so as to profit from it at any cost. As will be seen, that cost may be quite great.\line \line A quick note about how I came upon the source material; where it came from, how i came upon it, etc. In my spare time, and as I fancy, I write shaders. A shader is a little program which tells a computer's graphics card how much the colors red, green, and blue should contribute to any given pixel. It's amazing what can be done with this. No doubt you'll have played a video game, or at least seen one, so the virtual realities which can be summoned with those three colors will be familiar. What's more incredible is the feeling one gets when constructing those realities. I have worked extensively in just about every analog and digital artform, excepting live performance, and I can tell you that nothing will make you feel more like a god than writing a shader. It feels like true creation, as god creates. It's almost enough to move me away from my atheism. Not quite, though. Because in the end, you still aren't actually creating ex nihilo*.\line }

He might have thought it poetic. He might have hoped it would act as a sort of signal to indicate that an intelligence was communicating amidst the noise, the way in which SETI might search for primes in radio bursts coming from outer space. For my part, I can only say that the sequence holds no real aesthetic value, and it was not the key which allowed me to identify or decipher his method of communication.]}
