\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 On the seventh day, they crossed a charnel road. On the other side of this road was a small rock cairn splattered with white paint. This marked the grave of a pilgrim. An epitaph was carved into a stick of wood stuck in the ground right next to it. The writing was scoured into illegibility.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No one remembered which shrine the charnel road led to, or from which city the road began.}}
