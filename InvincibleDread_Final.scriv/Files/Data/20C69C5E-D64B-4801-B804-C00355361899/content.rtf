\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Millie, whose mental health had been fragile since the attack by the IRA gang on her home, was distraught when she discovered her husband's new romance. On November 18, 1924, she ordered a taxi to take her from her home at No 17 Fitzwilliam Street to the Hellfire Club in the foothills of the Dublin Mountains. Somewhere near Rathfarnham, she took out a Webley revolver that had been given to her husband by Michael Collins following the beard-cutting incident and she shot herself in the head.}{ }
