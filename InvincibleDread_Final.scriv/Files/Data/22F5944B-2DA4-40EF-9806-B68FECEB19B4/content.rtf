\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One religion is True, the rest are False.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Somehow, this simple dichotomy does not satisfy everyone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 More adventurous god-botherers will go as far as to say that no religion is in sole possession of the absolute truth, and that truth is somehow shared between them. They will compare the similarities and differences of belief and behavior, hoping to catch a glimpse of some overriding truth which is threaded throughout all the world\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s religions. What they find, then, is a doctrine which defines a truer, deeper religion. And they might be right about it. Unfortunately for them, Solitants come specially prepared for battle in this arena.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When a Solitiant proselytizes to the fractured, they open with the observation that every religion in existence turns on a story that explains the origin of suffering. The Supine Cult believes that there are two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mood swings. The Bavainu believe that suffering is a result of one\u8217\'92s own disobedience to a set of ancient commands. The Shell Kings believe that suffering is a symptom of Shellshasar, a sort of primordial ooze which can inflict a transmittable spiritual disease which dulls virtuous instinct. There are a hundred more religions, each with a thousand variations, and in every instance, the story of suffering\u8217\'92s arrival is accompanied by a solution for it. The Supine Cult entreats their followers to lay down and pray their energy into the sky to make it stronger, for that is where the righteous god dwells. The Bavainu assert, quite rigidly, that one must live in obedience to divine law, and only then does life have a chance of being happy. The Shell Kings recommend drinking the blood of a willing virgin mixed with a mind melting toxin found in a sea snail\u8217\'92s shell. Yes, every religion has its own solution to suffering, so that\u8217\'92s all they are\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 religions peddling relief. All religions do it. All of them, except for one.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Solitants offer no solution to life\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s troubles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 "We are the only ones who believe that suffering is nothing to fear," a Solitant priest will say. "Suffering is what this is all about!" He or she then smiles, and the smile accentuates the self-inflicted scar on their cheek which marks their initiation into Solitant orders. Those Solitants who have delved deep into the mysteries smile underneath a mask of scars.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 "Life }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  suffering", they say. "Try to suffer without suffering." They laugh because it doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t make sense. Truly, the Spark is like a block of sculptor's stone\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 clean, abstract, inert, featureless\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and then comes the sculptor's chisel. As the chisel carves away at the stone to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the person. What troubles our fleshy vessels is what makes us who we are. In this way, Solitants are artists of the Self. Their chisel is pain. Solraheen\u8217\'92s hand guides the hammer.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Common Hrkan speech has only the one word for pain. So, if a person says, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am in pain,\u8221\'94 there\u8217\'92s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe, or did a loved one die? Have their bowels been blocked for days? The word \u8216\'91pain\u8217\'92 can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are sharing the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The words \u8216\'91anguish\u8217\'92, \u8216\'91ache\u8217\'92, \u8216\'91soreness\u8217\'92, \u8216\'91irritation\u8217\'92, and \u8216\'91misery\u8217\'92 all approach different things, but they\u8217\'92re not nearly enough to cover the spectrum. Adjectives are a fancy invention, but in the end they\u8217\'92re all ill-defined, nothing but a fuzzy cloud orbiting that single, simple word\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Solitant goes as far as to claim that the very structure of Hrkan speech stunts the growth of pain appreciation. The mind cannot develop a sensitivity to certain flavors of agony if the world is divided into subject, verb, and object. Such structure separates the self from the action, and in so doing, grand vistas of becoming remain hidden from sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The keyturn comes after reflecting on the sentence, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91I hurt myself.\u8217\'92}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 I}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Hurt}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Myself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Notice how language has smuggled in a narrative. It has conjured out of nothing an \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91I\u8217\'92 from before and a \u8216\'91myself\u8217\'92 after the act of hurt. It has split the self in two, which is impossible, and it has reduced hurt from the basic mode of being to a phase transition. Solitants find this framing limiting, and so they invented a tenseless, subjectless language revolving around pain and its many flavors. Outside looking in, this language is more of a catalog of rasping utterances than a functional language, but Solitants claim it has utility.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was perfectly fine with the phrase \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91I hurt myself\u8217\'92. Hurting himself was the primary means he\u8217\'92d ever acquired hurt. His own bad moves badded back quite often. He suspected that it was much the same for everyone else. Really, there was no need to deconstruct something so universal. There definitely wasn\u8217\'92t any point in creating a whole new language to do it. Besides, pain was best expressed through the natural language of gesture, as Solraheen intended. In breadth of expression, the face is far, far superior to words. Of what use is an invented word when one can see the nature of a pain written on the face clear as day?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Check the eye and brow\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 is there languor, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience? Anxiety? Is the skin knit tight, or smooth and beaded with sweat? Is the eye\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lid puffy or hollow? Are the cheeks wet or dry, dark or pale, sallowing purple or yellow? Then there\u8217\'92s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up into the face. The lower back knots up, the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, then the lips draw tight and the teeth themselves will speak. A trained eye can look at another in pain and know, without words, the entirety of their inner world. A professional portrait painter knows double if they care to study the art. In the end, the holy language of the Solitants was wholly redundant. No argument could convince Mandri otherwise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That is, until a demon bit his thigh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pain fainted him, and it was pain which woke him up. It was a pain so intense that the slightest pressure elicited a scream. The skin around the already clotted wound was taut and throbbing, a drumhead reverberating pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto tried to make him walk. This was due to a miscommunication. He and Mandri were speaking different languages. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lungs had seized and so he could only speak in verbs, and they all sounded like wheezing hisses. Moto took this babble as a childish unwillingness to man up. He did not understand that simply standing was functionally impossible. In the end, Chopper tossed Mandri atop his own giant pack, and they walked on. With each step that Chopper took, Mandri\u8217\'92s raw wound chafed against Chopper\u8217\'92s shoulder, sending a fresh wave of excruciating pain into his groin and hip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Soon after, he fainted again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He woke up the next day when Chopper leaned back and dropped him from a height like a camel dropping dung. He landed hard on his wounded thigh and let loose a gargled curse. He tried to find some twist of hip and spine that could give relief, and these contortions ended with him lying flat and shifting most of his weight onto his right ass cheek. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He could breathe more freely now in this position. This was not a relief, because that meant he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t dead. Damn it all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The demon had bit his left thigh. Mandri could see it through a ripped up hole in his robe. The wound was poulticed. The brown woolen wraps which held it all together were ragged and splitting apart. A few sturdy threads were all that was holding the mass of spongy, mud-dusted weed-paste together. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri wavered between bouts of pain and self-pity for a short while, at which point he tumbled off this seesaw long enough to look away from his leg. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Sitting some fifty yards away, in this flat expanse of sand, was an enormous black egg of a rock. It was the size of an Hrkan outpost. It was ominous, unnatural, just sitting there, a single, smooth, uncracked rock. Rocks that big in the Sand tend to be slumping things that look half-melted by the sun, but this rock, this biggest of all boulders, was a healthy, upright egg. So precarious was its position that it seemed a strong blast of wind should be able to pick the whole thing up and send it rolling along the desert floor. Or perhaps if Ayram gave a hearty push, he could get it rolling. With no other rocky eminence in sight, well, that made it seem like that black egg had been deliberately placed there in the middle of nowhere by the hand of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Next to it was a huge pile of Ayramun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s haulings. There were no Ayramun in sight, save one, a wiry woman, tired and dour looking. \u8220\'93We been out looking for ya,\u8221\'94 she said when she noticed Mandri noticing her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri preferred the company of his pain and pity. He set himself to twisting to and fro to try and undo the searing knots that throbbed inside his knee, thigh, and hip. He tried to recall the words to an Old Jandri curse that could kill all that, but the pain was a powerful amnestic. So instead, he prepared the ground around him so that he could more comfortably wallow in it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That did not work. His next plan of action was to slide-shimmy over to the pile of packs so that he could use them as pillows. By this point, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d forgotten that Seb was there.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What happened to ya leg?\u8221\'94 she asked before spitting a wad of borcandi juice uncomfortably close to his affected thigh. She was obviously an old hand at chewing spines because she carried herself with that borcandi bent, like her muscles were stuck in tension and had been that way for years, shoulders hunched and tight, head knocked forward, limbs all slightly bowed as if she\u8217\'92d rusted that way. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was bitten,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93By what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri dragged himself up onto the pile of packs. He settled his elbow into a bag of grain and let his hip sink into an inside-out goat bladder stuffed with who knows what. It was enough to negotiate a tenuous peace with his wound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I say what ya get bit by?\u8221\'94 Seb asked. She was standing over him now. Her skinny shadow striped his belly. \u8220\'93Can smell death on ya.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri looked down at his poorly poulticed leg. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think I\u8217\'92m dying, if that\u8217\'92s what you mean. I made it through the worst of it. I think.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t look that way to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Last night I could hardly breathe. Now I can breathe just fine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What ya get bit by?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You wouldn\u8217\'92t believe me. Well, you might.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Try me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A demon?\u8221\'94 Seb asked as her face wrinkled up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you would\u8217\'92ve believed me. Ask Moto. He\u8217\'92ll tell you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, I can believe it. Only, ya thought I was a demon, so who knows what else ya might take for one. Sure it weren\u8217\'92t a lizard?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quite sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I mean, there\u8217\'92s always a difference \u8216\'91tween what ya saw, and what ya thought ya saw.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri grimaced as the pain in his leg reared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Should let me look at it,\u8221\'94 Seb said with concern. \u8220\'93Might be able to do somethin\u8217\'92 for it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mouth was a black wreck and her missing eyebrows made it near impossible to ascertain her intentions. She seemed as ready to rub her finger in the wound as sew it up. But as the pain in Mandri\u8217\'92s leg was stupid, and as he couldn\u8217\'92t think of anything worse than something stupid that refused to go away, he scrunched up the hem of his robe to reveal the bite. As soon as he did, Seb bit down hard on her borcandi spine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The many veins in his inner thigh ran black as ink, and nearer to the loose poultice, above his knee, those black veins bulged above his skin like nightworms. Then he unwrapped the long strip of wool that held the poultice in place. The various weedy leaves and lichens were too dried out to be doing any good, and he was able to flick most of it into his palm easily enough. The rest he had to pluck, for the pulped leaf stems closer to the flesh were caked in a gooey dark-brown emulsion of infected blood and poultice paste.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Clean it,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you think I\u8217\'92m doing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri kept picking until all that was left was the terrifying sight of a day-old demon bite. The edges of this fang-scalloped wound were festering red and black, and this jagged ring of dying flesh enclosed a puddle of that brown emulsion, which had, in part, been scraped away to reveal the red-raw muscle of his thigh. Somehow, it looked worse than it felt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 What really got Mandri worried were the inky black veins which wormed up his thigh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s see all of it,\u8221\'94 Seb said as she leaned over the affected area, admiring the patterns of necrosis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Absolutely not,\u8221\'94 Mandri quickened.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How\u8217\'92s the chest feel?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hurry up and do whatever you\u8217\'92re going to do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb studied the wound with care, dark eyes pouring over every detail as if she were a paint peddler discovering a painting\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s provenance, and the particular textures and colors of the budding scabs might help her determine if this were a forgery.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb pulled back with confidence. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That there is a demon bite.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know it is. You said you could help with the pain.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sorry. Can\u8217\'92t do nothin\u8217\'92 for it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri groaned and slapped the weedy poultice back onto his wound. Another flare of pain rolled him up. When he recovered, he did his best to re-wrap that ragged strip of wool around his thigh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this place, anyway?\u8221\'94 he asked, nodding towards the giant black egg of rock looming over them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They call it Minting Rock.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why\u8217\'92s it called that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t know. When I first heard the name I thought they were mintin\u8217\'92 counterfeit coin out here, away from pryin\u8217\'92 eyes. But that ain\u8217\'92t it. What it is, I don\u8217\'92t know. No one tells me shit. It\u8217\'92s not practical is what it is, \u8216\'91cause the nearest spring is twenty miles. An\u8217\'92 if that rock were any blacker, I\u8217\'92d call it Fabled Black.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri dabbed his finger against the black veins running up his thigh. That was a mistake. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93GAH!\u8221\'94 he yelped. \u8220\'93AAagggh!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a sacred place,\u8221\'94 Seb said, ignoring his cries. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s old. Older than half the world, I bet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri grabbed the base of his thigh and tried to choke the life out of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb chuckled. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s worse fates than bein\u8217\'92 bit by a demon. If ya\u8217\'92d been caught by Kalemites you\u8217\'92d be ate already, and the one to eat your stomach would be wearin\u8217\'92 your butt bone strapped to his forehead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would have preferred that,\u8221\'94 Mandri grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Awwww,\u8221\'94 Seb cooed. \u8220\'93Ya need a friend? Would ya like that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shut up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why? I\u8217\'92m serious. A friend\u8217\'92ll make the pain go by quicker.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, I don\u8217\'92t mean to upset you, but I don\u8217\'92t particularly like you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not?\u8221\'94 Seb asked, offended. \u8220\'93If it weren\u8217\'92t for me, ya\u8217\'92d still be slaughterin\u8217\'92 for those Hrkan pigs. I rescued you. \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do I look rescued to you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb eyed him over, then quirked her head to concede the point. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I s\u8217\'92pose not. But that don\u8217\'92t matter cause bein\u8217\'92 friends don\u8217\'92t actually mean we got to like each other.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was under the impression that it did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, friends is jus\u8217\'92 somethin\u8217\'92 people do to pass the time. Don\u8217\'92t actually need to like each other to do that. Not like anyone ever liked anyone else anyway. Two people get to know each other well enough and it ends in hate. Always does.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would disagree, but I can\u8217\'92t really challenge your experiences with my own.\u8221\'94}

Only reason two people ever liked each other is cause they weren\u8217\'92t well acquainted.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s only one way I could ever consider you my friend.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Help me escape.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Escape where? It\u8217\'92ll just be you and the Sand, an\u8217\'92 hows that help anything?\u8221\'94 She studied Mandri for a moment and a sarcastic glint caught her smile. \u8220\'93Want a slice of spiced jerk? That\u8217\'92s what ya need. Ya need a nice slice of spiced jerk.\u8221\'94 She dug around the pile of packs, then pulled out a leather sack and slipped her hand into it. Out came a dried slip of beef. She tucked it into her cheek to let it marinate in all the borcandi juice. She pulled out another one and extended it towards Mandri in a gesture of peace. Mandri batted it away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that supposed to make us even?\u8221\'94 he asked.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Again, you did not rescue me. I was a slave, and I remain a slave. Nothing in my situation has changed. In fact I\u8217\'92d say it\u8217\'92s changed for the worse.\u8221\'94 He pointed to his leg.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So ya don\u8217\'92t want the jerk?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My mouth has no saliva.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri sighed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know what you\u8217\'92re doing, Seb. You\u8217\'92re not going to cozy me into cooperating.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ayram can\u8217\'92t give out freedom like that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course he can.\u8221\'94}

The gods put us all on a path a long time ago, an\u8217\'92 all anyone ever does is follow it. That includes me, that includes Ayram, and best believe it includes you, too. An even if that\u8217\'92s not true, it\u8217\'92ll help ya get away from hatin\u8217\'92 everythin\u8217\'92 that happens, and jus let things be.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, if they were your friends, then that means you didn\u8217\'92t actually like them, right? So, no big loss.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya need a spine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri supposed she was talking about courage and can-get-through-it, but was pleasantly surprised when she dug into her left sleeve and pulled out a fresh borcandi spine. Well, fresh was a relative word. Something looking like fungus furred the spine\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll pass.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright,\u8221\'94 Seb said and she put the spine away. Then her eyes popped wide. \u8220\'93I know what ya need! Ya need burgeons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She dug into her opposite sleeve and pulled out a pouch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A blessed, yellow leather pouch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Bright as the morning.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Its belly bulged with burgeons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oooooooo!\u8221\'94 Seb shrilled as she marveled at Mandri\u8217\'92s awe. \u8220\'93We gotta burgeon biter, don\u8217\'92t we!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have burgeons?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Of course she did. She jangled the bag around like it was a baby\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bauble. The burgeons bouncing around inside hardly made a noise, but to Mandri\u8217\'92s ears it might as well have been bells of glory coming to take him into bliss.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I must admit,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I may have judged you too quickly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Friendship, ahhhh,\u8221\'94 Seb mused. \u8220\'93Friendship and burgeons. No better way to pass the time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A hint of distant motion caught Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eye, and people began to tumble out from Minting Rock\u8217\'92s belly. First one, then three, then seven of them. Last came Ayram. Each in turn took off jogging towards Mandri, Seb, and the pile of dumped goods. With Ayram at the rear it looked like the oncoming Ayramun were fleeing before a marauding giant.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb clutched the burgeon pouch close to her chest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, come on,\u8221\'94 Mandri whined.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She put a shushing finger to her lips. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not s\u8217\'92posed to have these. Don\u8217\'92t speak on \u8216\'91em. Ayram will toss \u8216\'91em in a fire.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The first Aryamun to reach them was the short, boorish man named Hill. Hill pushed Mandri over, casually ignoring Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s agonized hoot. He then stole the pack that Mandri had been laying against, and he gave Mandri an annoyed pout as he fluffed his own scraggly mustache with his bottom lip. Then he trotted back towards Minting Rock while the rest of the Ayramun loaded themselves up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram was the only one to simply stand and watch. He stood right over Mandri. Such was his size that Mandri actually felt humbled. However, as Mandri could not, by definition, be humbled, he mistook this feeling for something else. Yes, this was some other strange emotion that he could not quite place. Something like confusion, an out-of-placeness. It had something to do with how Ayram possessed all the familiar features of a man, but they were all so stretched that they didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t match the pattern of a person. Ayram was greater, somehow more solid, a reference point for being, like an old tree, or a father in the eyes of a son, or, and Mandri was leaning in this direction now, Ayram was a demon. Demons were as primordial as trees and fathers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moto!\u8221\'94 Ayram shouted, his voice rattling the hand which gripped Mandri\u8217\'92s stomach. \u8220\'93Get over here!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto was one of the Ayramun who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been scrambling around, hauling all those packs towards Minting Rock. He was hugging a bulging sack of sand-dried vegetables when he heard Ayram shout his name, and he immediately dropped that sack and jogged over to see what the fuss was about.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Explain,\u8221\'94 Ayram said as he pointed to Mandri\u8217\'92s leg.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s as I said,\u8221\'94 Moto intoned. \u8220\'93The boy got bit by a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Above the knee?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He jumped into a lizard pit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No I didn\u8217\'92t!\u8221\'94 Mandri wailed, but this whine wasn\u8217\'92t manly enough to reach Ayram\u8217\'92s ears so the giant ignored him entirely. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram said to Moto, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Explain why this boy jumped into a lizard pit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as if he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the faintest idea. Ayram crossed his arms and waited. Moto, cornered, cooked up a story about Mandri trying to escape. His whole body got involved as he told this big lie. Mandri was familiar with the technique. All that gesticulating, it wasn\u8217\'92t really about selling the lie, it was about letting everyone know that he was going to cause a fuss if he was called out for telling that lie. If Ayram thought that fuss would be more trouble then the whole thing was worth, then Moto might just get him to believe it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto finished up by extending his arms all the way out to the sky and declared, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The boy\u8217\'92s an idiot! He doesn\u8217\'92t }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 think}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 . He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s got a black Spark\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no, he\u8217\'92s got no Spark at all! You should have seen it, the demon was }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 chewing}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  on his leg and he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even try to fight the thing off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri knew he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t speak out of turn, so he was forced to resort to a series of incredulous gasps, and with each word that Moto spoke, Mandri scrunched his face up tighter and tighter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he made every effort short of squealing to let Ayram know that Moto was lying.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You didn\u8217\'92t do what I told you to do,\u8221\'94 Ayram finally said. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How could I?\u8221\'94 Moto griped. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92d take a hundred virgins to liven this one up. The boy\u8217\'92s a Mazid. He has no will to live.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What did I tell you to do?\u8221\'94 Ayram growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders dropped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Leave,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Defeated, Moto took off towards Minting Rock, but not before sending a threatening glare Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s way. Meanwhile, Ayram tapped out his frustration against his elbows as he stared at Mandri\u8217\'92s leg. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s an ill omen,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93A man gets bit by a demon and doesn't die, that means he\u8217\'92s an agent of Shis. Is that what you are?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shook his head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can you walk?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can try.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri rolled onto his stomach and pushed himself up onto his good knee, and from there, he stood up. His bad leg was as stiff as a board, though he was determined to walk on his own. He knew it would not go well for him if he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t carry his own weight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He took a step and shuddered. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 might}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  be able to hobble.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram nodded. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then make your way into the rock.\u8221\'94 He reached down and grabbed Mandri\u8217\'92s left arm. His gigantic fingers encircled Mandri\u8217\'92s bicep a whole half over. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is good that you try to walk. Evil would make itself a burden.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 With Mandri steadied, Ayram let go, then moved to retrieve the last items from the Ayramun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pile. He then stomped off towards Minting Rock, leaving Mandri to get acquainted with the thirty or so yards of sand between himself and that enormous black egg that housed that band of plucky Outland pokes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He hopped a few steps. His left leg couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t bear the slightest weight. It felt like his knee was splintered, like white shards of bone were stabbing into the meat of his thigh. But it was not a great distance, so he soldiered on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He thought of the Solitants and their sacred tortures. He wondered if they had a word for the particular arc of pain that a demon bite inflicts. He wondered what this pain would do to him, what kind of man it would make him if he toughed it out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He looked out at the empty Sand and recalled a heretical painting titled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91Oneness with the Divine\u8217\'92. It depicted a flayed Solitant lying on a rack, his skin completely unwrapped from his body, his bare anatomy exposed to desert. This mortification was a ritual performed by only the most schismatic of adherents. They were men and women who did not want to craft the self; they tried instead to destroy it. This particular ritual was an attempt to confront the \u8216\'91I\u8217\'92 with the truth that there was no edge between itself and the rest of reality. The motivating logic was as crude as the operation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 removing the skin removes the self\u8217\'92s most illusive boundary. With the skin gone, the conceit is laid bare.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No doubt the ecstasy depicted in that Solitant's face was put there by the artist. It was not possible that a person could remain conscious through such an ordeal.

This dark and cramped tunnel led him into a dead end of undressed stone stacked haphazardly like an old goatherd's fence. Above him, high up, was a circle of daylight. It seemed as if he were at the bottom of a dried-up well.}
