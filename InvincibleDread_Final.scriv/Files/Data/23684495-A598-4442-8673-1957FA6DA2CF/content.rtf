\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There is a flow of \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91mindstuff\u8217\'92 from which the physical world is borne.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This flow gets \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91knotted\u8217\'92 up, and these knots are particles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 These knots tie eachother up, according to laws of physics.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Eventually producing \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91consciousness\u8217\'92, which is fundamentally \u8216\'91mindstuff\u8217\'92. Physical perception is not an illusion per se, but the distinction between \u8216\'91mental\u8217\'92 and \u8216\'91physical\u8217\'92 is false.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 An individual \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91self\u8217\'92 is a container for complex knots of mind. Some memories, some perception apparatus.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When a person dies, the identity pops like abubble, spilling out memories into the flow of \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91mindstuff\u8217\'92}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It is possible to access these free floating memories through meditation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In the flow of mindstuff, there are \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91demons\u8217\'92, which are knots that swallow other knots. A great aberration. Swimming against the flow. It comes towards us, from the future.}}
