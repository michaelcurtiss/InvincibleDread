He took two steps for every one of Ayram\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s, and every one of these steps was a struggle. It wasn\u8217\'92t so much the wound in his thigh as it was the general soreness. His legs still hadn\u8217\'92t recovered from being dead, and a whole night of hard walking had been rough.}

The day\u8217\'92s heat was becoming unreasonable, and he supposed Ayram would want to squeeze effort out of every finger. Seb had already crested one hill and disappeared behind it. If they were meant to stop, surely she\u8217\'92d wait at the peak.}
