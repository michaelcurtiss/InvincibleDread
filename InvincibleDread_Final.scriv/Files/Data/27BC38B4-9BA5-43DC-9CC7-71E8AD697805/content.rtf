\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of nature has failed. The problem is always the same: complexity. Beauty is out there in the world and it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s connected with everything else. You can\u8217\'92t stalk it, kill it, and then stitch its hide to a frame, because to do that you\u8217\'92d have to kill everything, and that isn\u8217\'92t possible.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s also wrong.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri burped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He took another swig of the burgeon hooch that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d left steeping in a hole in the ground.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Imagine reducing a leaf to a fleck of green. A living leaf, its complexity, its pattern, its anastomosing veins pumped full of vital fluids, its birth and death, its fall from the branch, its decay into dirt, that whole nested universe, that complexity, reduced to a fleck of green. Reduced, because art is seduction; art directs attention away from what is actually there to focus on what the artist wants the world to see. One might paint an oasis, and look, there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a naked woman bathing in the mossy water. Rendering that leaf, giving it light and shadow and form, that would only distract the eye from the droplets of jade gleaming on her cinnamon skin. The sensible thing to do, if one must paint the leaf, was to slightly feather its edge into the sky so that eye didn\u8217\'92t get snagged on a hard line of verdant green set against a chalky blue. Blame it on the effects of atmospheric haze. Perhaps move the leaf and tree altogether if they don\u8217\'92t slide a wandering eye down towards that temptress\u8217\'92 stare. At that point, go ahead and remove the leaf and tree entirely, because it\u8217\'92s good practice to erase all evidence of a crime once it is committed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And what a crime it was. Some madness must possess a person to say to the creator, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d like to see it in my own}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1  }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 hand\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go and paint all this,\u8221\'94 Mandri said as he swept his hand across the horizon. \u8220\'93Take as long as you like. Take a lifetime. Take ten lifetimes! Then\u8230\'85 and then\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And then he forgot what he was on about because Gil wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t listening.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Gil was an ox.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had rescued Gil from a leech farm right outside of Meskalim. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d found the poor old beast withers-deep in a swamp, tied to a frame. The ropes kept Gil snug while leeches fed on him. Two wooden bars propped him up, kept him from collapsing into the murk from pain and exhaustion. Nowadays, Gil spent his time napping in the barren field that was Mandri\u8217\'92s farm. His big, dozing breaths rolled his yellow hide back and forth over his sagging spine. As Mandri was spiked up on burgeons, the sight of that rolling hide was a sight to see.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Gil\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s short hairs were swirling. A more intense, boiling swirl was something that only happened when Mandri sipped black-eye burgeons, and only then if he picked them fresh and got to the juice before it was exposed to the air. These down-valley burgeons did things differently. They\u8217\'92d make textures swirl, edges bleed, but their chief effect was that anything bright would sparkle\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Gil\u8217\'92s stubby white horns, the sunlight filtering through the drifting boughs of the hornscrub tree overhead, the puffs of cloud in the sky, pretty much everything that wasn\u8217\'92t hidden in shadow would sparkle. The effect was less pronounced when the burgeon was mixed in with a nasty hooch like this, but that didn\u8217\'92t matter, because all Mandri wanted to see was the salt stain on his field sparkle as it squirmed around.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seeing the salt move like that made him feel like he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t lost a battle to an inanimate thing. That salt was }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 alive}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 . Those salt crystals were a swarm of wriggling white larvae gnawing on his wilted bean stalks. Wrapped on poles like that, Sol\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s light, those bean stalks looked so much like martyred pilgrims.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri nestled deeper into the tree trunk\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s embrace as a cool breeze caressed his cheek. He sighed a little half-sipped, absent sigh, the kind of sigh that he\u8217\'92d start to make whenever he was ready for a nap. He let his eyelids slouch as he watched the flies buzz in and out of Gil\u8217\'92s snout. The ox would snore and blow those fuzzy black dots out of his great big nostrils, and then those flies would zip back in to lick at the only reliable source of moisture that they could find in this godforsaken field.}

Burgeon spiked hooch had never given Mandri an extra inner voice before. Odd that it should sound like Vigram.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The voice did not go away. It kicked him in the shin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pain pricked Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left eye open. A void was drifting some feet away, a brown blot amidst a sparkling, burgeon addled world. Mandri blinked, squinted, and this void resolved into a vision of Vigram, wrapped in a plain brown robe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri picked up a pebble and threw it at the man.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Vigram dodged it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Perhaps he was real.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s next instinct was to drink as much of his jumped-up hooch as he could, because no doubt Vigram would try to steal it. Then again, the man might not know what it was. It looked like milk. And it would be a waste to drink it all in one go as that would cause a blackout.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No, that wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This was a special drink. Worthy of preservation. Mandri had made plenty of special drinks, but this one was extra special because it was right here, a thing of the present. He could maybe try to hide it, tuck the clay jug away somewhere, maybe just nudge it behind the tree, but no doubt Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wily eyes were\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Burgeons can make a mess of a person, but he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t so far gone yet. A peculiar thing about this particular brew was that it left his wits untouched. Well, mostly untouched. Maybe a little touched. Toddler touched. Honestly, he wasn\u8217\'92t sure, but he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 felt}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  fine enoug hto take another long swig of his hooch. And now the burgeonsight had the oil in Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s beard glistening. The man\u8217\'92s beard seem to flow off his chin like a waterfall.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shook his head in disbelief. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry Vigram, but you don\u8217\'92t know me well enough to intervene here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, this isn\u8217\'92t an intervention. Please, by all means, fill your belly with that drink. Drink as much as you want. Eat all the burgeons in the world. I encourage it.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Vigram unfolded a short stool from nowhere, then sat down without asking if Mandri minded. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I suppose I should lead with this,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t have a daughter named Lora.\u8221\'94 He then pointed to Lora and said, \u8220\'93We are not related. In fact, her name is not Lora, it\u8217\'92s Pel.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}

You spurned this beautiful girl and rejected a comfortable life. Everyone else would look at you and see a hopeless young man, something like a worm, but I see you differently. I see hate and despair, the fruit of , but inside are the seeds of genius. You are fertile ground, Mandri. Have I explained this before, what makes genius? I\u8217\'92ll tell you. It\u8217\'92s hate. Well, hate has high walls, I\u8217\'92ll tone it down. I\u8217\'92ll say instead: }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 aversion}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 . A person has to dislike what everyone else is doing in order to go through the effort of doing things differently. Everyone else,\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 he said, spreading his arms out so as to summon the masses of world into his embrace, \u8220\'93Everyone else is traveling down a wide and easy road which we might call culture, and you see where they\u8217\'92re going, and it doesn\u8217\'92t look fun to you, so you drop off the road. Now, you don\u8217\'92t realize this yet, but in so doing you\u8217\'92ve started to make your own path. If you put in some effort, and start walking, the path you make might become a new road. Then, everyone else will look on and think, \u8216\'91how could he have possibly seen that route? He must be a genius!\u8217\'92.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Vigram deflated. He cast a look behind to Lora, or rather, Pel, and found no reassurance there because the girl was staring at Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay,\u8221\'94 Vigram said, return his attention upon Mandri. \u8220\'93Let me try this: I will tell you a story.\u8221\'94}

Good stories are a kind of currency in this world. They can make people do things they wouldn\u8217\'92t otherwise think to do.

That was another thing about burgeons, they numbed the face, so he wasn\u8217\'92t quite sure what it was doing. He could be making kissy lips at Vigram right now and he wouldn\u8217\'92t know it unless he focused. Whatever his mouth, cheeks, and chin were doing put a light in Vigram\u8217\'92s eyes, and the man nodded, which made his flowing beard jiggle like a ___.}

My life\u8217\'92s prospects quickly came to nothing. When my father found out that I had beggared us both, his anger was profound.

Without any real concerns to distract them, you might think that they are free to pursue their life\u8217\'92s intrinsic purpose and find happiness, but that\u8217\'92s not what happens. They either lose themselves to pleasure, or become bored and angry. They invent enemies where there are none, because they feel boxed in.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The implication,\u8221\'94 Vigram said, \u8220\'93is obvious. At the bottom, we are empty. There is no intrinsic purpose hidden inside of us. If we did have some purpose, surely all the wealthy people of the world would be joyous people, not whatever it is that they are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What does any of this have to do with anything?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, I\u8217\'92m telling you a story, and this is the backdrop to every story ever told. We have no natural purpose. What purpose we do have is }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 crafted.}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  It is }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 made.}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  That means it is something you can lose.

Don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t laugh, Mandri, you of all people should know this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t aware that he was laughing. He was staring at Vigram\u8217\'92s boiling beard. What a great beard. The man was truly feeling himself, growing a bit hysterical in the telling. Mandri caught this feeling and said, \u8220\'93If there\u8217\'92s a purpose to all this, please get to it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Vigram sat back and smiled. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What I\u8217\'92m saying is\u8230\'85I\u8217\'92ll say this\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 most people make their family their purpose. My father was such a man. I was his purpose in life. To borrow a poetic turn, I was his challenge to the Black. In his eyes, he lost. Worse, his attempt was squandered. If I were killed, he could have moved into grief, but no, he had challenged the Black and the Black had answered back by turning me into the living embodiment of a life\u8217\'92s wasted labor. That was how he saw it. So, he put his carpentry to work\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he made me a coffin. He sent it to me. Inside that coffin was a note which said, \u8216\'91You are going to die\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Won\u8217\'92t we all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes! Yes, I suspect you already see where this is going. I might have been a wastrel, but I was self-obsessed. I didn\u8217\'92t want to die. I saw the coffin and the note and became concerned. I began to see my father in every shadow. I couldn\u8217\'92t enjoy myself, couldn\u8217\'92t bother the whores, couldn\u8217\'92t sleep in the same place twice. If you knew the man, you\u8217\'92d know what was coming for me. What can I say? I was a wastrel who couldn\u8217\'92t confront even the thought of a confrontation. What did I do? I ran away to find a witch to fix my problems for me. If a witch could predict the exact moment when my father would try to kill me, then I could, I hoped, avoid that moment. So, I went and found a witch, and guess what she did?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She bored you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Vigram was so caught up in his own hysteria that he pushed right through Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s indifference, and with a grandiose smile he said, \u8220\'93She showed me who I was.\u8221\'94 He held his gaze, fat head waddling like a . \u8220\'93Fear drove me to find a witch,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I found her. What she did then, is  she drove out all fear forever by showing me who, and what, I was. Think about that. Think about what that implies. If you only knew, Mandri. She could show you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Show me what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you want to know, then first, you have to have that fear. Fear is an essential ingredient for the experience. Thankfully, she can give that to you, too.\u8221\'94}

There was a nasty squint in the shadow of her shawl, as well as a nose that was impossible to reason with. The illusion that she was some young, pert, pretty was melting away in the.  Mandri could but , perhaps it was the word, \u8216\'91witch\u8217\'92, but he sense that she was old, dammit she was tall, too tall for an old woman. That was man\u8217\'92s air she was breathing. And she wasn\u8217\'92t adorned with the usual veneer of civilization\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no shine-black bracelets, or bangles, or silver hoop earrings, no makeup or red-thread leaves trimming her robe. The only ornament in sight was the turtle-shell hilt of a dagger that she kept fashionably crooked in her waistband. The rest of her tawny self seemed slapped together in a reed hut on the banks of the river Jek. Her robes were black, yes, but stained dusty brown all over. She was dirty, with perfect teeth, yes, a full complement of perfectly straight and sun-bleached teeth were sparkling. They practically outshone the sun.}
\par\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Vigram shifted uneasy in her presence. He opened his mouth to introduce her, but Pel tsked at him, and then, darkening, she stepped forward.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Killing?\u8221\'94 Mandri mumbled. \u8220\'93The morality of something like that, it depends. Am I killing in self-defense? Are these, I don\u8217\'92t know, are they murderers?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You believe that killing is a question of morality?\u8221\'94 Pel\u8217\'92s voice was growing more feral with every swish of burgeonsight. \u8220\'93Let me rephrase. How do you feel about people? Would it be a great loss if everyone in the world dropped dead?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did I say that?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, after licking his lips, \u8220\'93everyone should be judged on their own\u8230\'85what\u8217\'92s the point of this, anyway?\u8221\'94 }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course I have, who hasn\u8217\'92t?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The shape that was nominally named Lora batted Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s flippant response out of the air. \u8220\'93Have you spoken the words yourself?\u8221\'94 she asked. \u8220\'93I do not count a prayer circle where someone else does the heavy lifting. Have you ever run away to a quiet place and whispered words to Solraheen?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri could not answer. The burgeonsight was coming on strong, and edges were starting to bleed together.

She flattened this crudity against her hip. Mandri craned his neck to see if he could read the scrawl on the cover, but of course the burgeonsight made that impossible.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She opened the book and jotted down a note on one of the browning pages. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re fitting the mold, Mandri. Does that excite you? You\u8217\'92ve passed one test already.\u8221\'94}

But there was something in it. She was staring at him too intensely. He was being beheld. Hers were a lovers eyes, or a murderer\u8217\'92s, it was difficult to say because there was a fine line between the two and those irises were wiggling and popping like beans in hot oil.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What keeps you here?\u8221\'94 she asked. \u8220\'93You have nothing.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Mandri simply.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You named the beast, Gil?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Gil mooed in recognition. The old witch grimaced and she gripped the turtle-shell hilt at her waist and pulled a long, black knife from an unseen sheathe. The sudden sight of this thin, curved blade drew Mandri up, and when she put it against Gil\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck, he shrieked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing!? Let him be!\u8221\'94}

The poor beast, eager to get in a good scratch, closed his eyes and lifted his chin higher to make sure Pel could scratch the whole length of it.}

She plunged her blade into the ox\u8217\'92s flesh, driving it tight up against his jaw, then abruptly yanked it round to the other side.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Gil let out a powerful bellow, deep and pitching. His whole bulk lurched backwards, pulling his head from Pel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grasp. He bucked as he stood up, knocking her aside, and he hoofed it into the dusty field, bleeding and bleating as he went, though he came to a stop just twenty yards away, blood pouring into the earth, apparently realizing there was nowhere to go. His look back was full of confusion at the betrayal.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri snarled, picked up a rock, and he leaped after the old hag who sat watching with glee.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One sharp elbow into his uglies sent him sprawling to the ground.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She plunged head first into Gil\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body, tearing a hole into his belly as easily as if her nose were made of flint. Gil crumpled to the ground, and she went with him, her head and shoulders fixed into his side. And before Gil\u8217\'92s spine had the chance to spasm, she tore herself from his flesh with the neck of his first stomach clenched between her teeth. She spat it out, then ripped the rest of the innards free from their lining. Kneeling, she hugged the largest stomach up to the sun. Her lips uttered a speech as black as Fabled Black. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri clasped his ears, but he could not look away.
