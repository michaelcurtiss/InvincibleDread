That was a mere statement of fact\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 everybody dies. My father had no intention of hunting me down. He\u8217\'92d only hoped that the awareness of death might spur me into action, and it did. I don\u8217\'92t know he ever discovered what I\u8217\'92ve made of myself, but I like to think that the abatement of his despair would have been most sublime, for he had, ultimately, triumphed against the Black. Now, I want to say the same thing to you\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 listen to what I say, Mandri\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 you are going to die}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 .\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Right now?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Uneasy pause. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Right now? No. Maybe. Tomorrow? What is the difference? You\u8217\'92re going to die, Mandri.\u8221\'94 A little shake of his head, as if that might shake loose the webs in Mandri\u8217\'92s will.}
