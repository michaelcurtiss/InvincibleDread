\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 In summary: Although I lack the math ability to write the equations for this theory, which is a paradigm shift similar to Galileo's discovery of the pendulum, I hope that physicists will abandon their self-serving inquisition against this theory and work out the details. I point out that they laughed at Hoyle too.One of the problems with string theory is the unbelievably small size of the strings involved. However, ropes are a couple of inches or so, the so-called "Snyder length". Instead of needing galaxy sized particle accelerators to see them, we can use ordinary telescopes.It is no secret that Feynman in his later years was leaning towards repudiating QED. I'm sure he would have endorsed rope\line \line Reference: https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/unveiling-rope-theory-a-new-paradigm-in-physics.149502/}{ }
