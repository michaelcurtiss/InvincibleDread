It was freshly dead from the storm. Most of its flesh had been stripped from the bone. What was left was being torn up by a horde of green jewels\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 green beetles that shimmered when they butted heads. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb stopped here briefly to collect as many of these beetles as she could. She offered one to Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re good chewin\u8217\'92,\u8221\'94 she said, \u8220\'93But I don\u8217\'92t got teeth for \u8216\'91em anymore.\u8221\'94 She proceeded to gum off a beetle\u8217\'92s butt and suck out innards through its rump like it were an oyster.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri declined.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A few feet away from this dead lizard was a living one of the same species. Moteah called it a Garool, and she said they could sleep unstirred under the sand for months waiting for a rain. When the rain came, and they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d wake up, mate, lay eggs, feast, then return to their quiescence. A charmed life, if not for the fact that this one\u8217\'92s partner was dead.}}
