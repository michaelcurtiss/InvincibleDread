\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Finding Elrahet was easy. That witch never moved far from where she sat down. That morning, Seb saw her sit down at the ambush sight spot. Getting up to that spot, however, was difficult. Seb could either climb up the steep cliff face, or she could take the long way around. She had to carry the bag of bones, so she took the long way, called the Junkug road. She followed that road through the hills and up into the mouth of the Junkug pass and there she scrambled off onto a smuggler\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s trail which snaked up towards the mountain peaks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was nearing mid-day when she made it to the wide, mid-cliff ledge where Elrahet was sitting. As far as sight spots go, it was perfect\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it offered a privileged view of the east, of the open Junkug plain. Directly below was the mouth of the Junkug Pass, out of which the Junkug road poured. This unkempt road meandered down into the red Junkug hills, where it was dissected into a filigree of footpaths that wiggled down into valleys and bent around black screes and outcrops of solid rock before shooting through the ravines and bowing along the bottoms of those orange washes before emptying out, at last, into the Junkug plain. Once out on the plain, all roads got lost because there the white ground is a rocky caliche that gets swept clean by the Junsi wind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet was alone up on that high ledge. To Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s blurry eyes, she was nothing but a bundle of black rags and long, smoky hair flowing out the front of an old crone\u8217\'92s hood. She was sitting cross-legged, communing with the vastness of the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Took you long enough,\u8221\'94 the witch mumbled as Seb approached.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t wait to catch her own breath before saying, \u8220\'93Gugi found some bones and\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 How did the witch know? The answer was obvious: this was the sight spot, and it had a good angle of every ravine. But also, Elrahet was a witch. Who knows how far her witchy eyes and ears could see and hear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bring them here,\u8221\'94 Elrahet growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Witches were cantankerous creatures, and Elrahet was especially so.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her age? Ageless. Though numbered age was a rare thing in the Sand. A sand dune has no numbered age, and an Outland witch like Elrahet was just as elemental. Her visage was as dark, sharp, and solemn as any slab of sand-bitten stone. Her sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the wrinkly bark of a pepperwood tree. What else did she resemble? A diseased goat; this envinced by the way the layers of her black-rag robe bulged around her knobbly frame.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shall I command your every twitch?\u8221\'94 Elrahet snipped. \u8220\'93Put the bag down.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb set the bag of bones down gently, hoping to avoid being shooed away before she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard any witchy words.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s great mission to spy on Elrahet, to know everything she was up to.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But Elrahet was an elusive creature, and she did not often speak her mind. When she did speak, she spoke bitterly. Her throat croaked like a dying man. She would mumble to herself in a private language that Seb called bloodspeech. Seb called it that because when Elrahet spoke it, her blood tingled. Her blood was tingling mightily now, for Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s withered lips curled and spat ancient curses while her sharp teeth gnawed at the bone-bag\u8217\'92s drawstring knot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When the knot was finally loosed, Elrahet reached in and pulled out a big leg bone, smooth and white, streaked with dirt and a yellow spots. She gave it a once over, then tossed the thing over the cliff.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Busy yourself,\u8221\'94 she growled to Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb sighed and stepped to the cliff ledge.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 How fruitless had her efforts with Elrahet been?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The only bit of wisdom she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ever heard Elrahet speak was a hackneyed bent spoken to young Papi. Papi had been pouting about some useless thing and Elrahet said to him, \u8220\'93Weakness is a strength, and strength is a weakness.\u8221\'94 If anyone else had said something as stupid and common as that\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Strength is strength.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Weakness is weakness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes, they were a weakness. If a thing was up close she could keep it sharp, but \u8216\'91way far out\u8217\'92 and \u8216\'91not too far off\u8217\'92 were smashed together into a blurry haze called \u8216\'91out there somewhere\u8217\'92. When she looked out on the Junkug plain from that high ledge, all she saw was a wash of white ground underneath a blur of blue sky.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The only good that came from her unreliable eyes was that she never had to stand watch, and while she took special pleasure in not being saddled with that chore, calling that a strength was only twisting words. A strong woman didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t need to twist words. For a witch steeped in the mysteries of the Spark to say a thing like that, to say \u8216\'91weakness is strength\u8217\'92, then there had to be some deeper purpose behind it. Elrahet only ever spoke to bend the world to her will. Her words might have been for Papi, but Seb had overheard it, and Seb overhearing it was no doubt a part of Elrahet\u8217\'92s intentions. The witch was sending her down a path. Could be that it was the wrong path. Most likely, it was. It definitely was if Elrahet knew of Seb\u8217\'92s part in things.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her eyes returned to the blur. Somewhere in it was a caravan, a  bumbling caravan unaware of her. Seb let her eyes cross so that the white landscape doubled and blurred andthe edge between the white caliche and the blue of the midday sky softened into a wide gradient. She squinted hard until there was nothing else in the world but that span of color. Somewhere inside that span was that caravan, a caravan of fools, fools who were going to get what was due.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A curious odor tickled her nose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A foul odor. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She took another sniff and was hit with a familiar musk\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She took a deeper sniff, as there was some other scent in it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Fullflaps nested up on the cliff behind; it could be them. Seb knew they were there without looking because when fullflaps jump out of their holes they flap their little wings so hard that they beat a pathetic, warbling whistle out of their tiny chests, and one of them was warbling up towards the mountain peak. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She licked her lip. Borcandi juice oozed out of the spine tucked in her cheek. Borcandi juice didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t play nice with the stomach, so most people spit it out, but Seb didn\u8217\'92t, not when spitting would break her concentration. Then again, her concentration was already broken, so she spat\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she spat out the whole damn wad, as big as her tongue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Damn ye, Seb! You\u8217\'92re a servant of Shis, I swear it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s accusation sent Seb into a flustered panic. A long track of her own green-gray spit laced the bag of bones sitting in Elrahet\u8217\'92s lap. Thankfully, none of it had touched Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Aw, my bad,\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93Sorry as shit, sis. Didn\u8217\'92t mean to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She crouched down and tried to atone for her absent-mindedness by wiping the bag clean with her dirty sleeve. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Didn\u8217\'92t mean it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I should toss you off the cliff!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet took up her gnarled root of a walking cane and swung it. Seb pulled back in time to watch the cane\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s large burl brush right by her nose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet glowered. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I should curse your flesh to steam your bones.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t mean it!\u8221\'94 Seb whined. \u8220\'93Here, let me\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet swung again. Seb ducked, was too slow, and the blow caught her on the cheek. If the old witch had been serious, she might have broken a nose. Seb stumbled back, touched the welling bruise, thought to beg her pardon, but Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s withering glare said her patience would not bear another stammered apology.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Leave me be,\u8221\'94 the old witch grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb stood back up and left, cursing herself as she went. This was another of her many weaknesses\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she was forgetful. She couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t hold onto a moment if she were alone in a pitch-black cave. People said this was because of all the spines she chewed, but she knew that wasn\u8217\'92t true because she\u8217\'92d always been like this. It was not a strength. Gugi said that if her mind was always jumping around, then at least she couldn\u8217\'92t be sad for too long, and so she should be happy about that, but somehow that wasn\u8217\'92t true\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 being sad was the one thing she could be for too long.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She leaned over the cliff face and spat a fat loogie down. It fell in a delightful little sparkling twirl, though she was denied the pleasure of seeing it splat on the rocks below because the ground was far enough away to be \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91out there somewhere\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Something moved behind her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto came scrambling down from some hidden perch up above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One displeasure to the next.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto, a black man from Zos, was stronger, younger, and more skilled than Seb in every way imaginable. He was too well put together to be an Ayramun, yet here he was. Everyone else made do with dark, patchwork robes and nail-strapped soles for shoes, but Moto had silver buckles on his oiled boots. He wore an orange robe that was tucked and folded into sharp knife pleats that slanted across his chest and were kept secured by a wide and tight red sash around his belly. He was so clean and fastidious that he would have been at home in the ass of the Hrkan elite. He even had a sword, a long, curved sword set inside a brass scabbard studded with gold. That sword even had a name. Worse than all of this, Moto had healthy teeth. Few things made Seb more aware of her own disgusting self than being in the presence of healthy teeth. A poke is hard done up when a smile did nothing but make her jealous. It was even worse when that smile was a judgmental smirk.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t see them, can you?\u8221\'94 Moto said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The bastard knew she couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see shit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s how he was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was a bag of dead bones not ten feet away, the illest of omens, yet here he was taking the time to lick the spit right out of her cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Course I can\u8217\'92t see,\u8221\'94 said Seb. Moto chuckled. His was a damned hearty chuckle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re there,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re on their way. Exciting, isn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94 He looked towards Elrahet, pretending to notice the bones for the first time. \u8220\'93Who is that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Loath to be interrupted, Elrahet grumbled out a barely-audible, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Looks like it was someone to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s nobody now.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, these bones don\u8217\'92t change anything?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet stood up, grabbed the bag, and tossed the whole thing over the edge of the cliff. Halfway down, the bag hit a crop of rock, and the bones burst out of the seams and went tumbling down to earth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet glared at both Moto and Seb. Her skin was so lined with age that even the subtlest action of her brow sent it cracking into sharp relief. She then huffed and charged them both, pushing past them to shuffle down the ridge path, leaving Seb to wonder at the meaning of her sudden departure.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Guess we good to go,\u8221\'94 Seb mused.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Indeed. We are in it now, \u8221\'94 Moto replied. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya\u8217\'92 sure they out there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto nodded and pointed out towards the blur. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a black speck and a faint cloud of dust on the horizon. That would be them. That would be our target.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s them?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who else could it be?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Could be anyone.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto snorted. He snorted often. This habit of his earned him the nickname \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91rutter\u8217\'92 because it sounded so much like a rutting boar, though no one ever said it to his face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He pointed to the desert with two imploring hands. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet predicted that the Voice and his new Mazid would be making for the pass. She said they\u8217\'92d come disguised as a blackwood caravan. She said they\u8217\'92d be coming mid-day today. And what-do-you-know, there\u8217\'92s a caravan out there. It\u8217\'92s mid-day today. It all fits. That\u8217\'92s who we are hunting. Do you doubt Elrahet\u8217\'92s abilities?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb spat another loogie off the cliff. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did El\u8217\'92 say anythin\u8217\'92 \u8216\'91bout a dead body?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Moto said defensively. \u8220\'93Are }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  saying something about a dead body?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not sayin\u8217\'92 nothin\u8217\'92, I\u8217\'92m }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 lookin\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  at it scattin\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92 them hills.

A dead leaf is a \u8216\'91foul omen\u8217\'92. You don\u8217\'92t have the sight, Seb. You can barely see your own toes. But you know who can? If Elrahet says there\u8217\'92s nothing to it, then there is nothing to it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How\u8217\'92s findin\u8217\'92 a dead body not put a notch in your spine?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because I\u8217\'92m a man of resolve, Seb. It\u8217\'92ll take more than your misgivings to put me off the hunt.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if its only pisspeddlers, and we come out here for nothin\u8217\'92?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If it\u8217\'92s only a few merchant men, then we slice the fat from their bellies and we knick a nob or two. What\u8217\'92s the problem?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if they\u8217\'92s a squad of cups?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A few soldiers won\u8217\'92t change the balance.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if it\u8217\'92s more'n a few?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then we\u8217\'92ll kill more than a few.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An\u8217\'92 how many is that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto sighed and sat down on the edge of the cliff. He propped his elbow up on one knee and let his other leg dangle free. He hunched over, cupped his sight, and began his squinting study of that distant blur.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t appreciate Moto sitting that way. It showed a casual disregard for what Seb was capable of doing. In a flash, she could be right behind him and push him off. She could end him right there. For all of Moto\u8217\'92s strength and skill with a sword, she could end him. There were plenty of moments like this when Seb could do it. She could do it while he slept, while he ate. Seb had half a mind to do it right now.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I count fifty-four of them,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93Give or take.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fifty-four\u8217\'92s more than \u8216\'91more\u8217\'92n a few\u8217\'92,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And fifty-four is exactly how many Elrahet said there\u8217\'92d be\u8230\'85though there is an odd fix about them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An odd fix?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto squinted again. He was having trouble keeping their quarry in focus.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s like they\u8217\'92re\u8230\'85it looks like they\u8217\'92re marching in squares.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know much, but she knew one thing for certain\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Moto\u8217\'92s expectations were getting in the way of the truth. There was one other thing she knew for certain: \u8220\'93There ain\u8217\'92t no caravan guard in this part of the world that keeps squares.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s why I say it\u8217\'92s an odd fix.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s an odd fix \u8216\'91cause they ain\u8217\'92t no caravan guard. I bet my spines those are cups. Those are fightin\u8217\'92 dents. El\u8217\'92 was wrong.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Eight wagons, though,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93She predicted eight, and eight there are.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb screwed up her face in thought.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Eight wagons was several more than the average merchant train.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ever heard of merchant marching in tight formation? Caravan hands in this part of the Sand were ragged bands of backwash from Hrkan conquests, not the kind to march in squares. Those men had to be cups! Vessels, Hrks called them. Fifty-four Vessels of righteous fury, and a god-damned Mazid backing them up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 How many more men might be hiding in those wagons?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Thirty?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb compared all this to what the Ayramun brought to bear\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 forty-three bows. Forty-three bows and Ayram. And old Elrahet. Against anyone else she liked the odds, but nobody tangled with the Mazidai with good reason.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 However\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Junkug hills were a decent place to bushwhack a column of cups. The slopes were steep, and no matter which route was taken through the pass, there were places where strong shoulders would have a clean shot at the column entire\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s assuming the whole column would try to stuff through all at once. Against fearful men, an ambush here would be a slaughter. Against experienced warriors, Seb was not so sure. Hrk-cloaked cups weren\u8217\'92t that dumb. Add a Mazid to the pot and it was sure to be a boil.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If the Mazid and its Voice was caught unawares, then maybe the odds were only three to one against. That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s assuming the Mazid got taken down early, by surprise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d take them for Vessels,\u8221\'94 Moto said, \u8220\'93But they\u8217\'92re wearing that stingy brown wool of blackwood guards.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Jus\u8217\'92 cause they\u8217\'92re in brown, don\u8217\'92t mean they\u8217\'92s common hands. A man can change his robe.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A Vessel doesn\u8217\'92t drop his whites for convenience, not even for subterfuge. It\u8217\'92d be a black mark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Sand makes converts of us all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pride,\u8221\'94 Moto noted through a plaintive sigh, \u8220\'93Is the only thing a Vessel has. Once he earns the hrkan whites, he\u8217\'92s not going to hide them for anything.\u8221\'94 He paused, and a subtle frown played on his lips. \u8220\'93Still, even if they\u8217\'92re wearing brown, they could be fighting men.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Cups won\u8217\'92t run when the killing starts,\u8221\'94 Seb said. When Moto stayed quiet, she felt compelled to add, \u8220\'93And the way we set up\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93This only works if they try to run. But ours is a game of risk. This is a Mazid we\u8217\'92re trying to catch. What do you expect? Even odds? The Vessels hardly matter.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re dead if we try it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re dead if don\u8217\'92t. Besides, it\u8217\'92s not your call. Ayram put me in charge while he\u8217\'92s off.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto stood back up to make sure Seb got the full measure of him. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Like it or not, this is the only opportunity we\u8217\'92ll have to catch us a Mazid. Elrahet being wrong about who the Mazid marches with isn\u8217\'92t enough to call this off.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about them bones?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about them?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If this don\u8217\'92t work, an\u8217\'92 Ayram finds out \u8216\'91bout that dead body, a body you didn\u8217\'92t let him hear of, then he\u8217\'92s blamin\u8217\'92 somone.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Unlike you,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93I take responsibility for my actions.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He pinched a flat stone finger whistle between his lips and whistled the song of the Jek Tresset to tell the Ayramun hidden in the valleys below that the ambush was on. He stabbed and fluttered the high notes to encourage haste. Twittered replies sprang up from the hills, and then, without so much as a parting nod, he set off down the path that led into that maze of mounded clay and rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb had different ideas about what needed doing. Elrahet was soon to conjure a blanket of fog to lay cover for the ambush, and damn it all if Seb didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t get to watch how she did it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s footprints had a witchy lightness to them, and so they were hard to follow. Thankfully, Seb was prepared\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she\u8217\'92d scouted for Elrahet\u8217\'92s cave the night before. It was a thin crack in the base of the massive slope of claystone which constituted the greater part of the mountain\u8217\'92s peak. It was a bit of a climb to get to it. How Elrahet managed it, Seb had no idea. Something to do with the witchy lightness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Just outside the cave crack, Seb heard Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s faint mumblings echoing out. She shuffled inside and saw the old witch squatting over the corpse of a sizable crack-backed lizard. The witch and the beast were both illuminated by a shaft of whitish light which fell down from a hole in the ceiling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The lizard was belly up, and Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fingers were knuckle deep in its guts. Her scrawny arm twisted and twirled, and her lips whispered incantations as her upturned eyes searched the sliver of midday sky.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She turned and set her dark eyes on Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb stumbled backwards in fright, bumping her head on a rock. She howled in pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption before setting her eyes back on the sky. She set her hand to work again, violating the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s corpse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She lowered her voice to a whisper. Seb strained to hear her garbled words.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Em bestet buguul,\u8221\'94 Elrahet growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She looked down at her handiwork. It was a twisted mass of innards and oily blood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Em bestet shemuul.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She pushed down hard with her palm to squeeze the last meal from the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shefre gor, amkukre dor.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her knotted fingers kneaded the intestines. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shefre gor, zom gagor.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up into the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She dropped the entrails back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within. Seb waited with bated breath for a sight of the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Spark, or some effervescent swirl of glowing smoke, or anything, but nothing happened.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly wider. Into this gaping hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow. The lizard\u8217\'92s belly bulged and squirmed as she pushed the beast\u8217\'92s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin.  Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Gummy tongue popped out of its shovel mouth. Yellow eyes flashed, and right when Seb supposed that the thing had come back to life,  Elrahet pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It may be,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said in a whisper loud enough for Seb to hear, \u8220\'93that the beast has a rotten womb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb ventured nearer and knelt across from the witch. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It won\u8217\'92t work?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not with this creature.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb poked the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s corpse with a curious finger. Inside that gaping bellyhole, blue-gray intestines writhed like a knot of bloated worms. \u8220\'93What\u8217\'92re ya\u8217\'92 gonna do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The All-White is not interested in this sacrifice,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said. \u8220\'93Only fertile blood may tease it down from heaven.\u8221\'94 Her ancient, unblinking eyes wandered over Seb\u8217\'92s neck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m too old,\u8221\'94 Seb said carefully. This did nothing to deter Elrahet from hissing like a snake who\u8217\'92d caught scent of a mealmouse. The witch reached out with her bony, claw of a hand. \u8220\'93Your arm,\u8221\'94 she demanded, and before Seb could protest, her bloody fingers snatched Seb\u8217\'92s wrist. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet smiled. Her witchy smile was more than a crick in the corner of the lip, it was full-on delight at the sight of the pulsing veins feeding into Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s palm. Seb half-wondered if she were some demon wearing Elrahet\u8217\'92s skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How much?\u8221\'94 Seb asked reluctantly. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The mess of lines cracking Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brow deepened into a more familiar sneer. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s only a cloud. We need only to crack open the door.\u8221\'94 She pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from out of the shadows and laid them between herself and Seb. She unsheathed a black talon of a knife from some hidden pocket in her robe and placed its curved handle into Seb\u8217\'92s palm. \u8220\'93You must do the cutting,\u8221\'94 she said, and she then held her own vein-riddled arm out for Seb to cut.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re taking your blood?\u8221\'94 Seb asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do not worry, girl,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said in worrying tones. \u8220\'93I see all ends, and won\u8217\'92t hold them against you. Now cut. Cut the vein there, I will heal.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb shuddered at the sight of the knife\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s impossible sharpness against Elrahet\u8217\'92s skin. Never had a blade been so eager to part flesh from bone, and eager for more than that, knapped as it was from a shard of Fabled Black. In the hands of a witch it could split a spine without sawing. In the hands of Elrahet, it could make a meal out of meaning itself. In Seb\u8217\'92s hands, it was an abomination. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She must not show hesitation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was her duty to act.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She tightened her grip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do what you will do,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said without affection.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I value your trust,\u8221\'94 Seb said, and she pricked the dagger\u8217\'92s tip into Elrahet\u8217\'92s flesh, then pulled with expert care to open a vein. Elrahet stayed strong through the sting, but watched with grave concern as blood streamed out of the wound and ran around her wrist, over Seb\u8217\'92s knuckles, to flow steadily down into the bowl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Somehow, Seb felt she was getting the rawer deal. That loss of blood was nothing compared with having to wield this unholy stone. Its use might taint her being. The blade was buzzing, it seemed, with insatiable hunger. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s it,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said as she jerked her arm free. She held her hand up and pinched the wound closed with her thumb, content with a bowl half-full. She mumbled dark words into the bowl, and once done, directed Seb to pour the blood into the lizard\u8217\'92s open belly while she wrapped her cut with the scrap of linen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 With the fresh blood added, Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s good hand reached into those bowels, and began again to stir. \u8220\'93Know that I could have your stomach for a bag,\u8221\'94 she growled before shooing Seb out with a tsk.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb stepped back out into the open air and cursed herself for letting Elrahet involve her in such a profane ceremnoy. It was never good to be the bloodletter when bloodmagic was the goal. Bleed someone in anger, that was fine. Bleed a Hrk in an ambush, that was justice. But bloodmagic, lifemagic, these things were evil for ordinary pokes. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 As Seb wandered back down the smuggler\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s route she wondered how many Hrkan bellies she\u8217\'92d need to bleed with an arrow before this fresh stain on her account was washed clean.}}
