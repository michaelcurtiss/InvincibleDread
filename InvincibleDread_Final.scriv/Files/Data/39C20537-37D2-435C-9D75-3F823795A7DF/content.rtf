In the weeks leading up to that moment, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d laze the days away in the hall of a would-be Lord named Eruhd. Erud\u8217\'92s palm wine was bright and refreshing, with accents of honey. Mandri drank his fill many times over, and he stuffed his face with peach chicken potstickers and pickled lizard pluck, all while admiring the paintings of the Lady Tumule.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri liked Tumule\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s work. She had no equal\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 surpassed by many, yes, but no true equal. She was decent. She was a painter\u8217\'92s painter, and that meant that the subtleties of her brush were completely lost on the Hrkan elite, and it also meant that her tremendous talent went largely overlooked. Mandri saw in her a kindred Spark, woman though she was, and he was inspired by almost everything she did and that included how she died. She killed herself by jumping from a balcony that overlooked the sea.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had scribbled a few compositions of that moment, the moment just before the jump. He put the Tumule standing on a white stone banister with waist-length hair wind-blown against her figure, hugging her, when nMandridy else would. Strangely, Mandri could never find someone to put up the funds for the finished piece.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 On one of those lazy days spent idling around in the Erud\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s halls, Mandri saw a rare sight\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 one of the eight Hrkan Lords was admiring Tumule\u8217\'92s paintings. The old man stopped to contemplate each piece, an especially curious sight because this Lord was the Lord Pogan, a rough and tumble fellow who\u8217\'92d risen up from the rumble of the Skulsi, a battle hardened fanatic who looked more likely to chew on the canvas than lose himself in the sweep of color. He wasn\u8217\'92t the usual foppish wimp that makes a show of art appreciation. And Lord Pogan struck his most thoughtful pose before Tumule\u8217\'92s greatest work, a painting titled, \u8220\'93The Shadow in Goriol Valley\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s opinion of the painting was that it was a work of meager genius, and only meager genius because Mandri could not, on principle, admit the existence of true genius. The painting was good. It was a view positioned from the lowest run of the Goriol Valley trail, looking up at the ridge line which sheltered the valley from the western wind. The sun was setting behind that ridge, so most of the scene was covered in shadow\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 blues, purples and muddy grays that appeared almost red when nestled against those cooler hues. Near the bottom, in the middle distance, was a sinuous, slow flowing creek. Its water was truly red. That creek is the first thing the viewer sees as one walks towards the painting from afar, for not only is the red creek spotlighted by the sun peeking over the ridge, but the composition is structured in such a way that the eye is drawn to a stepping-stone waterfall that\u8217\'92s set on a golden third. Below this waterfall, bobbing in its pool, is a brown lump of something strange. Step a little closer to the painting and it becomes clear that this lump is a face-down, lifeless body. The water isn\u8217\'92t merely red, stained as such by clay or vegetable matter, it is blood red, for the valley slope above is a shadow of human corpses.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One almost has to squint to see the bodies, but they are there, soldiers all, brown bodies folded and crumpled on top of each other like a storm had plucked them up like grass seeds in the Abari highlands and then dumped them there in the valley. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Lord Pogan said to himself, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This must be the worst painting I\u8217\'92ve ever seen.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was in shock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Why would such a man say such a thing?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mere idiocy did not cover it. He was a Lord. And as a Lord he would have seen the finest paintings in all the world so mere ignorance did not cover it either.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Perhaps the Lord was suggesting that Tumule did not accurately portray the embattled dead. Perhaps she should have stuck to what she knew and painted fruit and flowers instead, because a sheltered woman could not possibly capture the numinous beauty of a dead body piled on top of twenty others. No doubt the Lord had seen such piles. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d probably ordered them made. Did his chiding remark have merit? Mandri assumed he would never know. Then the battle of Minting Rock happened and a good seventy something Hrkans died, and most of the Ayramun as well. When the fighting was finished, Ayram directed whoever was left to gather up the dead, Hrk and Outland alike, and put them into a pile. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They were to be piled into the shape of a sphere. Mandri was not told why it should be a sphere instead of a regular old pile. A pile of bodies does not naturally take a sphere\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shape, so Mandri was told to construct a large bowl out of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s rubble. Mandri spent the afternoon building that giant bowl, and he did a terrible job on account of the hobble in his leg, the ache in his locked up lungs, and his general desire to be useless. When the bodies were eventually tossed into this leaky bowl they made a regular old lump\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 not a sphere. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No one seemed to care. An effort had been made and an effort was enough.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The mood was dour. The Ayramun had been handling their own. There were also those desiccated giants, corpses like the one\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s in Mandri\u8217\'92s closet tomb. In the collapse they\u8217\'92d split apart like twigs and whatever was found was tossed on top of the pile like tinder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 By twilight the grim deed was finished. The dead were all together, and Mandri was allowed to creep away. He sat alone atop a heap of rocks. He washed his dry mouth of sand with water, and he munched on some Hrkan hardtack he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d gathered from a dead man\u8217\'92s robe. He didn\u8217\'92t swallow, and he couldn\u8217\'92t taste a thing, not that there was anything to taste. It was a futile attempt to distract himself from the insanity of recent events. That pile of dead loomed large, and is thoughts turned to that painting of the Goriol Valley and the Lord Pogan\u8217\'92s chiding critique.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d helped to build did not resemble what Tumule had painted. There was significantly more blood in Tumule\u8217\'92s vision, and Tumule\u8217\'92s dead bodies were more seductive, though that was just how people were painted, living or dead. Her bodies were well-muscled and well-naked, or half-naked, and they looked like they\u8217\'92d just stepped out of a bath instead of choking each-other in the clay. It was a typical dramatic device\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the perfection of youth cut down before its time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but Tumule\u8217\'92s message went further than that, for Tumule came from a school of artists who thought they had important things to say. She wanted to make people aware, as if they weren\u8217\'92t already, of mankind\u8217\'92s abiding concupiscence.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her subject was war. Her angle was the perversion of lust and desire. Tumule\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s battlefield lay strewn with naked men lying upon naked men. They\u8217\'92d all come down from their passionate trance, where reason gave way to baser instinct, where they wrestled, where their limbs tangled and their weapons, phallic, penetrating, stabbed into slits that bleed. It was all quite pointed and homoerotic, with eyes rolled back, jaws slack, because ecstasy and death often looked the same and so did battle and sex\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 if one side isn\u8217\'92t satisfied, perhaps they go at it again until everyone is utterly spent.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri surveyed the rubble of Minting Rock, as well as his own memory of the battle, and there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a lick of sexual energy in any of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body could not be found, and that set the mood of the Ayramun careening into a fog of gloom. She had been well-liked. Seb had seen her jump into the fray, before the collapse, and that meant she was entombed in the bottom of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s central well.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Chopper\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s death was unnecessary. He\u8217\'92d lived through the collapse, but in a fit of chop-lust he sprinted towards a Hrkan soldier and was walloped by Ayram\u8217\'92s spear. Ayram was not forthcoming about precisely how it occurred. All he said was, \u8220\'93Idiot got in the way\u8221\'94. But Chopper\u8217\'92s body told the story\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 his ribs were shattered, and his lips were stained by his own blood. He\u8217\'92d died choking on it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Bush-headed Tob had been unlucky. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d survived the first half of Minting Rock splitting off, but from the way Moto told it, the second half\u8217\'92s collapse sent a leg-sized shard of stone whistling down in Tob\u8217\'92s direction. If Tob had been standing a step to either side, he would have survived.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch Elrahet survived, as witches always do. She was busy mumbling witchy incantations as she laid her hands on the pile of dead. Moteah was beside her, managing a meager flame that illuminated nothing as she tried, pitifully, to shield it from the wind with the nub of her wrist. The rest of the surviving Ayramun\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram, Seb, and Moto\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 kept themselves busy trying to salvage what they could from the destruction. They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d already looted the dead for anything useful, mostly foodstuffs, as the Hrks had brought plenty of hardtack wrapped neatly in crinkly brown-leaf squares, each stamped with the sunrose sigil of Hrk.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was all bullshit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His leg. His Sparkless stomach. Tumule\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s attempt to impress the world. The Ayramun, too, because all their friends had just been slaughtered and they were already moving on. There wasn\u8217\'92t a watery eye in sight when someone should be wailing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri bumped against the thought that he shouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even be here. He should be back in Meskalim, laying in his field getting high on burgeons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 High as the uglies on a too-tall horse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Folks in Eez call it tickleberried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look mad to be alive,\u8221\'94 Seb said. Unknown to Mandri, she had been idling nearby like a dried out lizard, still as dirty as when she\u8217\'92d been pulled out of the sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know what you neeeed,\u8221\'94 she said, half-singing. Mandri\u8217\'92s eye\u8217\'92s darted to a bulge at the side of her hip. It was burgeons. This glorious woman had managed to ferry them through the battle. And judging by the lethargic way she chewed her spine, like her jaw was made of tar, it seemed she might have sipped on one already.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93First we gotta sort ya out,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93An \u8216\'91fore that, I gotta tell you somethin\u8217\'92, now that I got ya here.\u8221\'94 She leaned in to whisper, like what she was about to say the most profound thing imaginable.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya been slapped by the hand of god.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri blinked. That was about all he could do aside from, and his face was locked in a }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ever hear a tell of the dolt who done stole the legs of the Lybion martyrs? Them bones were as watched as the sun, an\u8217\'92 some damn fool stole them. He got caught, and know what he said? He said, \u8216\'91I did what I did \u8216\'91cause the hand of Sol slapped me\u8217\'92. Then he said if old Sol didn\u8217\'92t want him to have those sacred legs, Sol wouldn\u8217\'92t have let the theft to happen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then continued on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks said if Sol wanted the fool to keep his head, Sol wouldn\u8217\'92t have let the fool be caught. So they cut his head for stealin\u8217\'92 those legs.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was now certain she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d licked a burgeon, because she stared at him like she couldn\u8217\'92t believe the size of his nose. To her addled eyes, his nose might well have turned into something else entirely.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya followin\u8217\'92?\u8221\'94 she asked impatiently.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri gave no hint of an answer, so she searched his face for one. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s never comfortable when someone looks that closely. Mandri made him smile. Crestfallen}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Course ya don\u8217\'92t follow,\u8221\'94 Seb crowed. \u8220\'93Ya square wheel.\u8221\'94 She then grabbed Mandri\u8217\'92s collar and said, \u8220\'93Come on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She led him to the makeshift arena in the middle of Minting Rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rubble, for that is where Ayram sat. He had his broad back turned, uncovered, and he was sitting on a wooden stool that had been scavenged from wreckage. The stool squeaked and groaned every time Ayram shifted his weight, but the man himself was perfectly silent as Elrahet sewed up a severe gash that wrapped around his side. As she worked, she washed away the sand from his tightly sculpted skin with a wet rag. Tightly sculpted was putting it mildly. Aryam was animal skinny, and strong. Each time he lifted his arm to give Elrahet clearance to scrub, the striations in his shoulders popped and his shoulder blade melted into a pool of rippling muscle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He glanced over his shoulder and noticed Seb approaching.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, you soilbucket! We been waiting half a hand.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb ducked under the words with a reverent bow. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When I never do what I said I was gonna do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram winced as Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bone needle nicked a rib.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bring him there,\u8221\'94 he said, eying the Mazidariga child. The poor thing was dead. Seb directed Mandri to sit down next to it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram sighed, then he slapped his knees and stood up. He twisted back and forth to test the stitchwork that riddled his side, and this sent a thin stream of blood dribbling down towards his hip. Elrahet tried to get him to sit back down, but Ayram pointed with his bearded chin towards Mandri and the Riga.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go and do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet grumbled, then waddled over to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s side. She pushed him down, so that he lay flat next to the Riga, their bellies even, and she knelt in between their heads, making sure the skirt of her robe folded nicely to make a pillow for her creaky knees. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From nowhere, that golden knife flashed in her hands. It shone red in the light of the setting sun. Somehow Mandri knew it was not meant for him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet craned her chin towards the oncoming night. The speech that ushered from her throat was so polluted with guttural urks that Mandri wondered if they were even words. Not even the belching of toads sounded so much like gibberish. After she croaked through a garbled verse, she bent low over the Riga child and with her blade she cut the air around it, as if freeing it from some invisible tether, and when that was done she raised her arm and stabbed her knife into Riga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s black-robed belly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Riga child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes flicked open and bulged as if trying to escape its skull, one red eye twisting left towards Mandri, the other twisting right. Mandri squiremed away, but Ayram\u8217\'92s boot stomped down his shoulder, pinning him place as the Riga\u8217\'92s whole body juddered, and its little legs spasmed, kneeing Mandri\u8217\'92s hip. Elrahet pushed down on the Riga\u8217\'92s chest with her free hand to steady the creature, and when the jerking finally settled down, she ripped the blade from the stomach, bent over the wound, then set her lips upon it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Every fiber of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s being wanted to look away from this unholy sight, but he couldn\u8217\'92t\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 such is the allure of dark and twisted things. The Riga wasn\u8217\'92t human, but it looked enough like an innocent child that Mandri felt shame for staring, and he nearly fainted when the witch slurped up blood from the hole in the Riga\u8217\'92s belly. A trickle of red dripped from her scrunched-up withered lips as she swung around to kiss Mandri. But of course, it was more crude than a kiss\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she squeezed Mandri\u8217\'92s jaw open, and spit the contents of her mouth into Mandri\u8217\'92s throat. Out came blood and chunks of viscera, and so too came a formless gray smoke, the same smoke that had zipped out of Mandri body before the battle of Minting Rock began.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet shut Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw, clenched it tight with her leathery palm, and set to whispering that guttural language into his ear. She held her dagger aloft Mandri\u8217\'92s throat and nicked the air above it, then seemed to brush Mandri\u8217\'92s body with her blade as she played at guiding the smoke down into his lungs. Then her beady eyes snapped wide.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quick!\u8221\'94 she barked, and Moteah rushed over. Elrahet yanked her down to her knees, and she almost fell onto Mandri\u8217\'92s chest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Squeeze the hand,\u8221\'94 Elrahet demanded, and she held up her own crooked claw of a hand to demonstrate, clutching some invisible heart and pumping it with her fist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah held up her poulticed wrist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When nothing happened, Elrahet reached out with her knife and cut through the bandage that held it all together. The poultice meat sloughed off to reveal the nub of Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wrist. In between the coin-splotches of dried black paste was a web of pink skin looking especially fresh against her dark complexion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Squeeze the hand ,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said again as she rubbed Mandri\u8217\'92s chest. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah squeezed, and Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ribcage thumped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He gasped in shock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah squeezed again, and another thump bumped up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Harder,\u8221\'94 Elrahet growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s determination deepened, such that she was no longer breathing. Sweat beaded her brow, and just when it seemed that she would faint, Mandri\u8217\'92s lungs heaved.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He took in the deepest, most glorious breath he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ever taken.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When the great exhale came, he muttered, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol\u8217\'92s light.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Sawing off the Riga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Riga can track our Mazid. I want to know how.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah sat back onto her heels and heaved a sigh of relief. Then Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s great paw gripped Mandri\u8217\'92s whole head and lifted him up to stand back on his feet.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do not know how the Mazidariga tracks him, and it would be a waste of time to discover it.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A more urgent matter threatens our fate. The Mazidariga.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Damn right,\u8221\'94 said Seb, who was crouching nearby like a sandrat waiting for someone to drop a crumb of bread. Ayram silenced the wiry woman with a sideways glance, then he glowered at Mandri and asked, \u8220\'93How many Mazidariga are there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 Mandri answered, still finding his breath. \u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t know they existed.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was quick to counter her. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no use in fighting Hrk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hah!\u8221\'94 Elrahet c. It seemed laughing almost sent her to pieces.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram clarified, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re not fighting Hrk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It doesn't\u8217\'92 look that way to me,\u8221\'94 Mandri said as he studied the pile of Hrkan dead. \u8220\'93what is the one thing the Hrkan Lords are scared of?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look, if you fight Hrk it\u8217\'92s only going to come back around. You think they\u8217\'92re evil, but the Lords don\u8217\'92t care about the outland tribes. Not really. You\u8217\'92re tangential. In fact, they\u8217\'92ve sympathy for you if you can believe it. The Lords are the only thing holding the common folk back from stealing what good land you people have left. If your goal is to plunge Hrk into chaos, you\u8217\'92ll be signing your own writ of doom.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram chuckled and shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I need no lecture on the evil breeding in the heart of the Hrkan people.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why agitate them?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The force of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s argument was working an energy into him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you want Hrk to fall, you have to be precise. Kill a few choice men and women, the ones keeping the corruption in check. And perhaps a few others who bridge the nation\u8217\'92s natural divisions. Apply some pressure to the right places, and Hrk will fall apart under its own weight. Like Minting Rock.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Careful.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hrk hates itself more than it hates you. Simply get the people to no longer want to be a nation, and they won\u8217\'92t be. That will give your outland tribes room to breathe.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You speak as if you have experience toppling empires.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do you think Hrk tore down the Old Jandri world? It wasn\u8217\'92t Mazidfire. It was disagreement. Disagreement is humanity\u8217\'92s natural impulse.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The thing you don\u8217\'92t get,\u8221\'94 said Ayram, \u8220\'93Is that I don\u8217\'92t care about Hrk. I don\u8217\'92t care about the outland tribes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, then what\u8217\'92s all this for?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s useless.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, tell me.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The word Amalgamete unsteadied Mandri. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard it before but couldn\u8217\'92t remember precisely when. Then looked deeply into Ayram\u8217\'92s eyes, to gauge the man\u8217\'92s sincerity. Mandri, in turn, looked to Elrahet, who was as set in stone as her leader, and the memory of the demon witch Pell came flooding back. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb seemed less convinced of the mission, though she was more difficult to read. It was difficult to know what lay behind her scowl at a glance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was probably nothing more than a too-sour borcandi spine, as a string of juice was dripping from her lip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is an Amalgamete?\u8221\'94 asked Mandri. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not use, \u8220\'93 Elrahet said, but Ayram ignored her. \u8220\'93The Amalgamete is the king of demons. A god-swallower. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is a demon, and it is evil.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If there\u8217\'92s this great evil running around, why not let Hrk deal with it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet thrust her cane in the air and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t have time for this!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri squirmed inside his black swaddling robe. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You went through all this, because you need me to kill a demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is the Lord of demons.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram leaned on his spear and said firmly, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do we avoid the Mazidariga?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well that\u8217\'92s simple,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93Actually, the solution was in your grasp just now, but true to form you\u8217\'92ve squandered the opportunity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Out with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could capture a Riga after it has whistled the pseudospark out of my body, then you could walk wherever you please unmolested. You would then wake me once you reached your destination.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb stood up and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wait a finger\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 are you saying that we could have\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram waved Seb off, but Mandri answered her anyway. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, you could have carried me and my poor cousin around the Sand free from the worry of the Hrkan hunt. Or, you could end all difficulties by giving me a Spark.\u8221\'94 He mounted his argument before anyone had time to laugh. \u8220\'93One distant whistle from a Mazidariga will end me. If I had my own shard of the divine, then it stands to reason that I would be freed from the Mazidariga\u8217\'92s influence entirely.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Free from the hunt,\u8221\'94 Ayram muttered.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93But if you give me a Spark, you would be giving me my freedom.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me, creature, if a true Spark danced in your belly, what would stop you from killing us? What would stop you from violating your word?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothing,\u8221\'94 Mandri admitted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Behold!\u8221\'94 she shrieked. \u8220\'93A truth! None will come as quickly from a puppet\u8217\'92s tongue. I\u8217\'92d sooner trust the creature with a venomed blade than a Spark. We\u8217\'92re better off stumbling blind into a nest of battles.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram smirked. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll make do without its wisdom. And we should make ready. We\u8217\'92ll have to outpace the Hrks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To where?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We make for the bones of Bullr, then we head south to the Goree Mountains.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was unimpressed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Bullr basin is surrounded by Hrkan posts. If there was a lord of demons dwelling anywhere near there, it would have been noticed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The demon isn\u8217\'92t hiding in the bones. It hides in the Goree.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where in the Goree?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t know?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grin spread wide inside the bloody bush of his beard. \u8220\'93This may surprise you, Mazid, but I know things which I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was not surprised. Neither was Mandri. The biggest of all outland pokes was unable to distinguish between knowledge and gut instinct\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this was one of the least surprising things in all of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s creation. Also unsurprising was the sad truth that other pokes went along with it. Absurd, but not surprising, as size is certainty in the Sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The only surprising bit was Elrahet. This woman had knowledge of the Spark, visions of the future, and yet, she was content to call herself Ayramun. It was because of her that Mandri feared the truth of the Amalgamete, though not just her. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d now met two witches wielding golden knives, and both speaking of a godlike being. Importantly, they didn\u8217\'92t disagree about this god\u8217\'92s existence, but whether or not it needed to be killed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri decided that Mandri ought to know about that other witch, Pel, the one who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d started him on this journey. Perhaps it might change Mandri\u8217\'92s mood if he knew that these pokes weren\u8217\'92t the only ones preaching about an Amalgamete. It might make Mandri more amenable to his Minding. If the Amalgamete were real, then all of this might make sense.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He found himself hoping it was real. It would be a real shame for that big pile of bodies to mean absolutely nothing. If it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t mean anything, then any old passing artist could stumble by and make it mean whatever they wanted, and that would be a shame.}}
