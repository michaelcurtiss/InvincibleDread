In the weeks leading up to that moment, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d laze the days away in the hall of a would-be Lord named Eruhd. Erud\u8217\'92s palm wine was bright and refreshing, with accents of honey. Mandri drank his fill many times over, and he stuffed his face with peach chicken potstickers and pickled lizard pluck, all while admiring the paintings of the Lady Tumule.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri liked Tumule\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s work. She had no equal\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 surpassed by many, yes, but no true equal. She was decent. She was a painter\u8217\'92s painter, and that meant that the subtleties of her brush were completely lost on the Hrkan elite, and it also meant that her tremendous talent went largely overlooked. Mandri saw in her a kindred Spark, woman though she was, and he was inspired by almost everything she did and that included how she died. She killed herself by jumping from a balcony that overlooked the sea.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had scribbled a few compositions of that moment, the moment just before the jump. He put the Tumule standing on a white stone banister with waist-length hair wind-blown against her figure, hugging her, when nMandridy else would. Strangely, Mandri could never find someone to put up the funds for the finished piece.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 On one of those lazy days spent idling around in the Erud\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s halls, Mandri saw a rare sight\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 one of the eight Hrkan Lords was admiring Tumule\u8217\'92s paintings. The old man stopped to contemplate each piece, an especially curious sight because this Lord was the Lord Pogan, a rough and tumble fellow who\u8217\'92d risen up from the rumble of the Skulsi, a battle hardened fanatic who looked more likely to chew on the canvas than lose himself in the sweep of color. He wasn\u8217\'92t the usual foppish wimp that makes a show of art appreciation. And Lord Pogan struck his most thoughtful pose before Tumule\u8217\'92s greatest work, a painting titled, \u8220\'93The Shadow in Goriol Valley\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s opinion of the painting was that it was a work of meager genius, and only meager genius because Mandri could not, on principle, admit the existence of true genius. The painting was good. It was a view positioned from the lowest run of the Goriol Valley trail, looking up at the ridge line which sheltered the valley from the western wind. The sun was setting behind that ridge, so most of the scene was covered in shadow\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 blues, purples and muddy grays that appeared almost red when nestled against those cooler hues. Near the bottom, in the middle distance, was a sinuous, slow flowing creek. Its water was truly red. That creek is the first thing the viewer sees as one walks towards the painting from afar, for not only is the red creek spotlighted by the sun peeking over the ridge, but the composition is structured in such a way that the eye is drawn to a stepping-stone waterfall that\u8217\'92s set on a golden third. Below this waterfall, bobbing in its pool, is a brown lump of something strange. Step a little closer to the painting and it becomes clear that this lump is a face-down, lifeless body. The water isn\u8217\'92t merely red, stained as such by clay or vegetable matter, it is blood red, for the valley slope above is a shadow of human corpses.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One almost has to squint to see the bodies, but they are there, soldiers all, brown bodies folded and crumpled on top of each other like a storm had plucked them up like grass seeds in the Abari highlands and then dumped them there in the valley. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Lord Pogan said to himself, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This must be the worst painting I\u8217\'92ve ever seen.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was in shock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Why would such a man say such a thing?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mere idiocy did not cover it. He was a Lord. And as a Lord he would have seen the finest paintings in all the world so mere ignorance did not cover it either.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Perhaps the Lord was suggesting that Tumule did not accurately portray the embattled dead. Perhaps she should have stuck to what she knew and painted fruit and flowers instead, because a sheltered woman could not possibly capture the numinous beauty of a dead body piled on top of twenty others. No doubt the Lord had seen such piles. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d probably ordered them made. Did his chiding remark have merit? Mandri assumed he would never know. Then the battle of Minting Rock happened and a good seventy something Hrkans died, and most of the Ayramun as well. When the fighting was finished, Ayram directed whoever was left to gather up the dead, Hrk and Outland alike, and put them into a pile. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They were to be piled into the shape of a sphere. Mandri was not told why it should be a sphere instead of a regular old pile. A pile of bodies does not naturally take a sphere\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shape, so Mandri was told to construct a large bowl out of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s rubble. Mandri spent the afternoon building that giant bowl, and he did a terrible job on account of the hobble in his leg, the ache in his locked up lungs, and his general desire to be useless. When the bodies were eventually tossed into this leaky bowl they made a regular old lump\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 not a sphere. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No one seemed to care. An effort had been made and an effort was enough.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The mood was dour. The Ayramun had been handling their own. There were also those desiccated giants, corpses like the one\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s in Mandri\u8217\'92s closet tomb. In the collapse they\u8217\'92d split apart like twigs and whatever was found was tossed on top of the pile like tinder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 By twilight the grim deed was finished. The dead were all together, and Mandri was allowed to creep away. He sat alone atop a heap of rocks. He washed his dry mouth of sand with water, and he munched on some Hrkan hardtack he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d gathered from a dead man\u8217\'92s robe. He didn\u8217\'92t swallow, and he couldn\u8217\'92t taste a thing, not that there was anything to taste. It was a futile attempt to distract himself from the insanity of recent events. That pile of dead loomed large, and is thoughts turned to that painting of the Goriol Valley and the Lord Pogan\u8217\'92s chiding critique.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d helped to build did not resemble what Tumule had painted. There was significantly more blood in Tumule\u8217\'92s vision, and Tumule\u8217\'92s dead bodies were more seductive, though that was just how people were painted, living or dead. Her bodies were well-muscled and well-naked, or half-naked, and they looked like they\u8217\'92d just stepped out of a bath instead of choking each-other in the clay. It was a typical dramatic device\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the perfection of youth cut down before its time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but Tumule\u8217\'92s message went further than that, for Tumule came from a school of artists who thought they had important things to say. She wanted to make people aware, as if they weren\u8217\'92t already, of mankind\u8217\'92s abiding concupiscence.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her subject was war. Her angle was the perversion of lust and desire. Tumule\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s battlefield lay strewn with naked men lying upon naked men. They\u8217\'92d all come down from their passionate trance, where reason gave way to baser instinct, where they wrestled, where their limbs tangled and their weapons, phallic, penetrating, stabbed into slits that bleed. It was all quite pointed and homoerotic, with eyes rolled back, jaws slack, because ecstasy and death often looked the same and so did battle and sex\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 if one side isn\u8217\'92t satisfied, perhaps they go at it again until everyone is utterly spent.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri surveyed the rubble of Minting Rock, as well as his own memory of the battle, and there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a lick of sexual energy in any of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body could not be found, and that set the mood of the Ayramun careening into a fog of gloom. She had been well-liked. Seb had seen her jump into the fray, before the collapse, and that meant she was entombed in the bottom of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s central well.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Chopper\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s death was unnecessary. He\u8217\'92d lived through the collapse, but in a fit of chop-lust he sprinted towards a Hrkan soldier and was walloped by Ayram\u8217\'92s spear. Ayram was not forthcoming about precisely how it occurred. All he said was, \u8220\'93Idiot got in the way\u8221\'94. But Chopper\u8217\'92s body told the story\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 his ribs were shattered, and his lips were stained by his own blood. He\u8217\'92d died choking on it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Bush-headed Tob had been unlucky. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d survived the first half of Minting Rock splitting off, but from the way Moto told it, the second half\u8217\'92s collapse sent a leg-sized shard of stone whistling down in Tob\u8217\'92s direction. If Tob had been standing a step to either side, he would have survived.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch Elrahet survived, as witches always do. She was busy mumbling witchy incantations as she laid her hands on the pile of dead. Moteah was beside her, managing a meager flame that illuminated nothing as she tried, pitifully, to shield it from the wind with the ragged poultice of a nubby wrist. The rest of the surviving Ayramun\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram, Seb, and Moto\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 were busy doing something or other. Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t care to find out because he\u8217\'92d bumped against the thought that he shouldn\u8217\'92t even be here. He should be back in Meskalim, laying in his field getting high on burgeons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 High as the uglies on a too-tall horse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Folks in Eez call it tickleberried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And why wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t he high right now?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 These damned Ayramun, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s why.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He felt the urge to announce his displeasure.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 More than that, he wished to curse the Ayramun to a long life of misery.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But for a curse to work it must be uttered within earshot of the intended, and Mandri had no voice. Even if he could speak, it would not go well for him if Ayram were to overhear him whispering appeals for dark tidings. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If he wanted to impress himself upon these Ayramun he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have to be more creative. He\u8217\'92d have to be discreet. He wondered if it were possible to devise a gesture so off color it could be mistaken for a compliment, like a roaring burp that expresses satisfaction with a meal. Except in that particular instance the burp }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 is }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 a compliment. The point is that it was an acceptable level of rudeness. Perhaps the peak of what is acceptable. It would take something many times more vulgar than a burp to adequately express Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s irritation, and that would be difficult to play off as some genial spasm of . A burp, sure. A rude jerk of the ugly, no.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He thought about it for a little while and when he came up with no ideas he became convinced that a surreptitious approach would not do. The whole point of abusing someone wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t necessarily to make them miserable, it was to let them know that }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 he}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  was the one making them miserable. That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s why curses have to be uttered within earshot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look mad to be alive,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t noticed Seb idling up on high in the bowels of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s corpse because she hadn\u8217\'92t bothered to wipe herself clean of sand and looked like a block of petrified wood. She crawled down from her perch, then ambled over to invade what little space Mandri had claimed for himself. She sat right down next to him and said, half-singing, \u8220\'93I know what you neeeed.\u8221\'94 She patted a pouch which bulged her robe at the side of her hip, and Mandri\u8217\'92s mood changed in an instant.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Burgeons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Of course. The moment he begins to wish for burgeons, and they appear. That blessed bulb. That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s why Mandri loved burgeons, they could be relied on. And like a long- lover, he grew jealous. Seb chewed a spine like her jaw was made of tar, which gave him the impression that she had sipped at least one burgeon dry already.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His longing must have been obvious, because Seb chuckled and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93First we gotta sort ya out. An \u8216\'91fore that, I gotta tell you somethin\u8217\'92, now that I got ya here.\u8221\'94 She leaned in to whisper, like what she was about to say the most profound thing imaginable.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya been slapped by the hand of god.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri blinked dumbly, then jabbed at Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burgeon pouch with his walking out finger.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ever hear a tell of the dolt who done stole the legs of the Lybion martyrs?\u8221\'94 Seb asked. \u8220\'93Them leg bones were as watched as the sun, an\u8217\'92 some damn fool stole them. He got caught, and know what he said? He said, \u8216\'91I did what I did \u8216\'91cause the hand of Sol slapped me\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She paused to make room for some great insight. It did not come.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That fool said next that if old Sol didn\u8217\'92t want him to have those sacred legs, Sol wouldn\u8217\'92t have let the theft happen. Make sense?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It did.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks said if Sol wanted the fool to keep his head, Sol wouldn\u8217\'92t have let him be caught. So they cut his head clean off for stealin\u8217\'92 those legs.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was now certain that she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d at least licked a burgeon, because she stared at him like she couldn\u8217\'92t believe the size of his nose. To her addled eyes, his nose might well have turned into something else entirely.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya followin\u8217\'92?\u8221\'94 she asked impatiently.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri gave no hint of an answer, so she searched his face for one. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s never comfortable when someone looks that closely. Mandri made him smile.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Course ya don\u8217\'92t follow,\u8221\'94 Seb crowed. \u8220\'93Ya square wheel.\u8221\'94 She then grabbed Mandri\u8217\'92s collar and said, \u8220\'93Come on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She led him around the mound of Minting rock, towards the makeshift arena in the middle of it. That was where Ayram sat. He had his broad back turned, uncovered, and he was sitting on a wooden stool that had been scavenged from wreckage. The stool squeaked and groaned every time he shifted his weight. The man himself was perfectly silent. Elrahet was there too, sewing up the severe gash that wrapped around Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s side. As she worked, she washed away the sand from his tightly sculpted skin with a wet rag. Tightly sculpted was putting it mildly. Aryam was animal skinny, and strong. Each time he lifted his arm to give Elrahet clearance to scrub, the striations in his shoulders popped and his shoulder blade melted into a pool of rippling muscle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He glanced over his shoulder and noticed Seb approaching.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, you soilbucket! We been waiting half a hand!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Now Mandri knew for sure that Seb had sucked a burgeon, because half-a-hand was the amount of time it took for a strong burgeon to come into its own. The coincidence could not be ignored. Whatever her state of mind, she was sound enough to duck under Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s charging words with a reverent bow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When I never do what I said I was gonna do?\u8221\'94 she asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram winced as Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bone needle nicked a rib.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bring him there,\u8221\'94 he said, eyeing the ground, eying a body on the ground, swaddled in black. It was the Mazidariga child. The poor thing was dead. Seb directed Mandri to sit down next to it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram sighed, then slapped his knees and stood up. He twisted back and forth to test the stitchwork that riddled his side, and this sent a thin stream of blood dribbling down towards his hip. Elrahet tried to get him to sit back down, but Ayram pointed with his bearded towards Mandri and the Riga.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet grumbled something to herself, then waddled over to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s side. She pushed him down, so that he lay flat next to the Riga, their bellies even, and she knelt in between their heads, making sure the skirt of her robe folded nicely to make a pillow for her creaky knees.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If Mandri could speak he would have asked what was going on, then from nowhere, Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s golden knife flashed in her hands. It shone red in the light of the setting sun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The witch set her eyes to the oncoming night. Something resembling speech ushered from her throat. It was so polluted with guttural urks that Mandri wondered if they were even words. Not even the belching of toads sounded so much like gibberish. After she croaked through a garbled, breathless verse, she bent low over the Riga child and with her blade she cut the air around it, as if freeing it from some invisible tether. When that was done she raised her arm and stabbed her knife into Riga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s black-robed belly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If Mandri had a voice he would have screamed, for the Riga child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes flicked open and bulged about to pop out of the skull, one red eye twisting left towards Mandri, the other twisting right. Mandri squirmed and made to flee, but Ayram\u8217\'92s boot stomped down his shoulder, pinning him in place. Elrahet barked a foreign word and the Riga\u8217\'92s whole body juddered, and its little legs convulsed, kneeing Mandri\u8217\'92s side. Elrahet pushed down on the Riga\u8217\'92s chest with her free hand to steady the creature, and when the jerking finally settled down, she ripped the blade from the stomach, bent over the wound, and set her lips upon it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Every fiber of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s being wanted to look away from this unholy sight, but he couldn\u8217\'92t\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 such is the allure of sinister things. The Riga wasn\u8217\'92t human, but it looked enough like an innocent child that Mandri felt shame for staring, and he nearly fainted when the witch slurped up blood from the hole in the Riga\u8217\'92s belly. A trickle of red dripped from her scrunched-up, withered lips.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then she swung around to kiss Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She squeezed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw open, and spit the contents of her mouth into Mandri\u8217\'92s throat. Out came blood and chunks of viscera all webbed together by a formless gray smoke, the same smoke that had zipped out of Mandri\u8217\'92s body just before the battle of Minting Rock began.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet shut Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw, and he struggled to swallow. The contents in his mouth was did not pass inspection, and his throat refused to let it pass. So it all stewed atop his tongue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet bent down and began to whisper her guttural language into his ear. She held her dagger aloft his throat and nicked the air above it, and suddenly the wash of __ was sliding down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quick!\u8221\'94 she barked, and she beckoned towards Moteah. Moteah rushed over, Elrahet yanked the girl down to her knees.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Squeeze the hand,\u8221\'94 Elrahet demanded, and she held up her own crooked claw of a hand to demonstrate, clutching some invisible heart and pumping it with her fist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah held up her poulticed wrist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri felt nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet reached out with her knife and cut through Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s poultice. The wrappings came off fairly clean, but her dark skin was crusted over with coin-splotches of crusted black paste, and in between these was a web of fresh pink skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Squeeze the hand ,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said again as she rubbed Mandri\u8217\'92s chest. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah squeezed, and Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ribcage thumped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He gasped in shock, a rattling wheeze, and when Moteah squeezed again another thump bumped up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Harder,\u8221\'94 Elrahet growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Just when it seemed that Moteah would faint from the effort, Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lungs heaved, and next came a loud bonecrack as if his ribs had been locking his lungs and had shattered. He took in the deepest, most glorious breath he\u8217\'92d ever taken, and he worried for a moment that his ribs had shattered, for along came a loud crack of bone. Looked to his side to see that Ayram\u8217\'92s chisel had crushed right through the center of the Riga\u8217\'92s neck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri rolled out from under Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s foot, and was able to scramble away as Ayram finished decapitating the creature. No one else was moved by this sudden desecration. There was some concern in Elrahet\u8217\'92s squint, though Mandri supposed she was upset to be left out of the butchery.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks are sure to have more of these things,\u8221\'94 Ayram said as he picked up the bleeding head. \u8220\'93If they can track a Mazid, I want to know how.\u8221\'94 He held the head up to the sun as if Sol\u8217\'92s light could unwind the secrets hidden in the Riga\u8217\'92s crafted flesh. Indeed, there was a seam in its skin, and stitching, and the faint line ran around the back the of the head, around the small, chubby ears and down what was left of the neck. Before Ayram could take a knife to it, there was the matter of the strange metal-plated muzzle fastened to the Riga\u8217\'92s face. Ayram ripped it off. It did not come cleanly. The whole contraption had been riveted to the bone. Out came a spray of skin and blood, but Ayram, unbothered, continued to pull until he had claimed the entire lower jaw.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was careful study of human anatomy, and what he saw undone in Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hands was not, strictly speaking, human. The tongue hung off the upper palate, and there were iron staples in the back of the exposed throat which stretched open an orifice packed with tubes of woven cord. Fragments of these tubes reappeared lower down the neck, where Ayram\u8217\'92s chisel had crushed the hanging spine. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was all beyond Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s reckoning. Ayram\u8217\'92s too. Perhaps the giant had been expecting to find some simple compass device which pointed right at Mandri\u8217\'92s empty stomach. Such a device could be defeated and they could wander the Sand without a worry. But dark arts such as fleshwork are both ancient and avant-garde, not the tastes of man . He held the skull low for Elrahet to take. This was more her line of . But she was not enthused.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She drew up a scowl and declared, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is abomination.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was not surprised. The biggest of all outland pokes was unable to distinguish between knowledge and gut instinct\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this was one of the least surprising things in all of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s creation. Also unsurprising was the sad fact that other pokes went along with it. Absurd, but not surprising, as size is certainty in the Sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The only surprising bit was Elrahet. This woman had knowledge of the Spark, visions of the future, and yet, she was content to call herself Ayramun. It was because of her that Mandri feared the truth of the Amalgamete, though not just her. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d now met two witches wielding golden knives, and both speaking of a godlike being. Importantly, they didn\u8217\'92t disagree about this god\u8217\'92s existence, but whether or not it needed to be killed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri decided that Mandri ought to know about that other witch, Pel, the one who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d started him on this journey. Perhaps it might change Mandri\u8217\'92s mood if he knew that these pokes weren\u8217\'92t the only ones preaching about an Amalgamete. It might make Mandri more amenable to his Minding. If the Amalgamete were real, then all of this might make sense.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He found himself hoping it was real. It would be a real shame for that big pile of bodies to mean absolutely nothing. If it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t mean anything, then any old passing artist could stumble by and make it mean whatever they wanted, like they do with rocks and trees and entire landscapes, and that would be a shame.}}
