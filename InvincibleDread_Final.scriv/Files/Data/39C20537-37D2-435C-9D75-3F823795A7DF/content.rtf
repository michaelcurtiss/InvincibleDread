In the weeks leading up to that moment, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d laze the days away in the hall of a governor named Eruhd. Mandri drank the governor\u8217\'92s wine, stuffed his face with peach chicken potstickers and pickled lizard pluck, all the while admiring the paintings of the Lady Frumule.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri liked Frumule\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s work. She had no equal\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 surpassed by some, yes, but no true equal. She was decent. She was a painter\u8217\'92s painter, and that meant that the subtleties of her brush were completely lost on the Hrkan elite, and her tremendous talent went largely overlooked. Mandri saw in her a kindred spirit, and he was inspired by almost everything she did and that included how she died\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she killed herself by jumping from a balcony that overlooked the sea.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had scribbled a few charcoal compositions of that moment, the moment just before the jump, the lady standing on a white stone banister with waist-length hair wind-blown against her figure, hugging her, when nobody else would. Strangely, Mandri could never find someone to put up the funds for the finished piece.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 On one of those lazy days spent idling around in the governor\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s halls, Mandri saw a rare sight\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 one of the twelve Hrkan Lords was admiring Frumule\u8217\'92s paintings. The old man stopped to contemplate each piece, an especially curious sight because this Lord was the Lord Gagan, a rough and tumble fellow who\u8217\'92d clearly risen up from the grumble of the Skulsi, a battle hardened fanatic who looked more likely to chew on the canvas than admire its deft use of color. He wasn\u8217\'92t the usual foppish wimp that makes a show of art appreciation. And Lord Gagan struck his most thoughtful pose before Frumule\u8217\'92s greatest work, a painting titled, \u8220\'93The Shadow of the Goriol Valley\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s opinion of the painting was that it was a work of meager genius, and only meager genius because Mandri could not admit anyone as a true genius. The painting was good. It was a view from the low Goriol Valley trail, looking up at the ridge line which sheltered the valley from the eastern winds. The sun was setting behind that ridge, so most of the scene was covered in shadow\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 blues, purples and muddy grays that seemed almost red when nestled against those cooler hues. Near the bottom, in the middle distance, was a sinuous, slow flowing creek. Its water was truly red. That\u8217\'92s the first thing the viewer sees as one walks towards the painting from afar, for not only is the creek spotlighted by the sun peeking over the ridge, but the composition is structured in such a way that the eye is drawn to a stepping-stone waterfall that\u8217\'92s set on a golden third. Below this waterfall, bobbing in its pool, is a brown lump of something strange. Step a little closer to the painting and it becomes clear that this lump is a face-down, lifeless body. The water isn\u8217\'92t merely red, stained as such by clay or vegetable matter, it is blood red, for the shadowed valley slope above is carpeted in human corpses.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One almost has to squint to see the bodies, but they are there, soldiers all, brown bodies folded and crumpled on top of each other like a storm from the Abari highlands had ripped through the valley and dumped them there. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Lord Gagan said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think this is the worst painting ever made.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No doubt the Lord had seen a mound of bodies before. Probably, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ordered them made. Perhaps the Lord was suggesting that Frumule should have painted fruit and flowers instead, because a sheltered woman could not possibly capture the greater meaning that a well bloated body presented when it was piled on top of twenty others. Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t say for sure as he had never seen a pile of the battle dead. He always assumed that he never would. He would never know if the Lord\u8217\'92s chiding remark had merit. Then the battle of Minting Rock happened and a good seventy something Hrkans died, and half the Ayramun as well. When the fighting was finished, Ayram directed whoever was left to gather up the dead, Hrk and Outland alike, and put them into a pile. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They were to be piled into the shape of a sphere. Mandri was not told why it should be a sphere instead of a regular old pile, and as a pile of bodies does not naturally take a sphere\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shape, Mandri was conscripted to construct a large bowl out of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s rubble. Mandri spent the afternoon building that giant bowl, and he did a terrible job on account of the hobble in his leg, his missing hand, and his general desire to be useless. When the bodies were eventually tossed into this leaky bowl they made a regular old lump\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 not a sphere. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No one seemed to care. An effort had been made and an effort was enough. Mandri supposed everyone was too exhausted to be upset with poor workmanship. And they were handling their own dead friends, so the mood was dour. There were also those desiccated giants, the ones that had been tucked away inside of Minting Rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tombs for who knows how many centuries. In the collapse they\u8217\'92d split apart like twigs and whatever was found of them was tossed on top of the pile like kindling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 By twilight the grim deed was finished, the dead were together. Mandri was allowed to creep away and rest against a heap of rocks, and there he sat, alone, munching on some Hrkan hardtack he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d gathered from a dead man\u8217\'92s robe. His thoughts turned to that painting of the Goriol Valley and the Lord Gagan\u8217\'92s chiding critique.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This pile of dead did not resemble what Frumule had painted. There was significantly more blood in Frumule\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s vision, and Frumule\u8217\'92s dead bodies were more seductive, though that was just how people were painted, living or dead. Her bodies were well-muscled and well-naked, or half-naked, and they looked like they\u8217\'92d just stepped out of a bath instead of choking each-other in the sand. It was a typical dramatic device\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the perfection of youth cut down before their time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but Frumule\u8217\'92s message went further than that, for Frumule came from a school of artists who thought they had important things to say. She wanted to make people aware, as if they weren\u8217\'92t already, of mankind\u8217\'92s abiding concupiscence.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her subject was war, her project was the perversion of lust and desire. Frumule\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s battlefield lay strewn with naked men lying upon naked men. They\u8217\'92d all come down from their passionate trance, where reason gave way to baser instinct, where they wrestled, where their limbs tangled and their weapons, phallic, penetrating, stabbed into slits that bled. It was all quite pointed and homoerotic, with eyes rolled back, jaws slack, because ecstasy and death often looked the same and so did battle and sex\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 if one side isn\u8217\'92t satisfied, perhaps they go at it again until everyone is utterly spent.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri surveyed the rubble of Minting Rock, as well as his own memory of what had transpired, and there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a lick of sexual energy in any of it. There\u8217\'92d been excitement, yes, but that did not last long. Whatever relief there was at the end had been firmly put to bed as soon as the bodies of the dead were tallied.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body could not be found, and that set the mood of the Ayramun careening into a fog of gloom. She had been well-liked. Seb had seen her jump into the fray, before the collapse, and that meant she was entombed in the bottom of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s central well.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Chopper\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s death was unnecessary. He\u8217\'92d lived through the collapse, but in a fit of chop-lust he sprinted towards a Hrkan soldier and was walloped by Ayram\u8217\'92s spear. Ayram was not forthcoming about precisely how it occurred, as all he said was, \u8220\'93The idiot got in the way\u8221\'94. But Chopper\u8217\'92s body told the story\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 his ribs were shattered, and his lips were stained by his own blood. He\u8217\'92d died choking on it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Bush-headed Tob had been unlucky. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d survived the first half of Minting Rock splitting off, but from the way Moto told it, the second half\u8217\'92s collapse sent a leg-sized shard of stone whistling down in Tob\u8217\'92s direction. If Tob had been standing a step to either side, he would have survived.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch Elrahet survived, as old witches always do. She was busy mumbling witchy incantations as she laid her hands on the pile of dead. Moteah was beside her, managing a meager flame that illuminated nothing as she tried, pitifully, to shield it from the wind. The rest of the surviving Ayramun\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram, Seb, and Moto\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 kept themselves busy trying to salvage what they could from the destruction. They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d already looted the dead for anything useful, mostly foodstuffs, as the Hrks had brought plenty of hardtack wrapped neatly in crinkly brown-leaf squares, each stamped with the sunrose sigil of Hrk.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s all bullshit,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He was referring, of course, to everything\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 his leg, his skin sticky from sweat, Frumule\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s attempt to impress the world, and the Ayramun, too, because all their friends had just been slaughtered and they were already moving on. They were glum, sure, but it didn\u8217\'92t feel like that was enough. Not a watery eye in sight when someone should be wailing. Poor Chopper. Poor Tob.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And Obo was gone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Unfortunate.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had lost his hand for nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He thought about humming a song for Obo. Obo wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t human and never had a Spark, but he was deserving of a song, and if not a song, at least something more than mere remembrance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri groaned against the thought that he shouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even be here. He should be back in Meskalim, laying in his field getting high on burgeons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 High as the uglies on a too-tall horse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Folks in Eez call it tickleberried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All he had to show for his many travails were the wounds.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb had been idling nearby like a dried out lizard. She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look mad to be alive.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri snorted and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Unfortunately it seems I\u8217\'92m too lucky to die.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lucky?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve cheated death about five times in the past four days, so I\u8217\'92m starting to think that luck is real.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb chuckled, though that did nothing to lighten the mood because she was so grimy. A fat black borcandi spine poked out between her rubbed-down teeth. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No such thing as cheatin\u8217\'92 death,\u8221\'94 she said. She spat a wad of goo into the sand. \u8220\'93If there was, then everyone been cheatin\u8217\'92 death every moment of their lives. Shit, since you been sittin\u8217\'92 there you breathed \u8216\'91bout a hundred times\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s a hundred deaths you just put off, but I don\u8217\'92t see you thankin\u8217\'92 luck for the miracle.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Breathing is not a miracle.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell that to folks that can\u8217\'92t breathe. Friend of mine once died when she was sleepin\u8217\'92. Wasp flew straight in her open mouth and stung her in the dangly bit. Thing swole up the size of a pigs uglies.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sounds horrible.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An\u8217\'92 it could happen to you. Could happen any given moment, but I don\u8217\'92t see you prostratin\u8217\'92 yourself every second, thankin\u8217\'92 luck for keepin\u8217\'92 the damn wasps from uggin\u8217\'92 up your throat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, in case it\u8217\'92s necessary, I will give thanks.\u8221\'94 Mandri opened his arms to the reddening sun and said, \u8220\'93I thank you, Luck, for keeping the wasps away!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb snorted and smirked. She appreciated the sarcasm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No one\u8217\'92s special,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93Everybody is who they is and that\u8217\'92s all they is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t disagree.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wouldn\u8217\'92t matter if you did. The gods are playin\u8217\'92 a game an\u8217\'92 that\u8217\'92s all there is to it. An\u8217\'92 you best believe me\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8216\'91cause you might catch sight of the hand of Solraheen, and you best be ready or else you get slapped.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Right,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, flippantly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t \u8216\'91right\u8217\'92 at me,\u8221\'94 Seb said, offended.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sorry. It\u8217\'92s just the last time I heard someone talk about Solraheen\u8217\'92s hand, it was a priest getting his head chopped off.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s a priest losing his head got to do with it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He was arrested for stealing the legs of the Lybion martyrs from the temple of Jeetz.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A look of disbelief on Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s weathered face. She said, \u8220\'93Them legs are as watched as the sun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s why they caught him and put him on trial. And you know what he said in his defense? He said the hand of Solraheen directed him. He said if Solraheen didn\u8217\'92t want him to have such sacred relics, then Solraheen wouldn\u8217\'92t have allowed the theft to occur in the first place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And he were right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The judge said that if Solraheen wanted that priest to keep his head, Solraheen wouldn\u8217\'92t have allowed the man to be caught.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb nodded without appreciating the irony. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s how it is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They both sat there, staring at the mound of bodies, Seb in wistful repose, and Mandri leaning away, wondering if the odor pricking his nose was coming from Seb, or himself, or the bodies. The woman was still as dirty as when that Hrkan soldier had pulled her out of the sand. She was as comfortable in that cake of dirt as any burrowing lizard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Eventually, Seb stood up and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come on.\u8221\'94 She brushed off her ass, as if that would wipe away the absolute filth that covered her. \u8220\'93I been lookin\u8217\'92 for the Mazid\u8217\'92s body all day, an\u8217\'92 now that you're free, you\u8217\'92re gonna help me find it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because that\u8217\'92s what Ayram told me to do, an\u8217\'92 now that\u8217\'92s what I\u8217\'92m tellin\u8217\'92 you to do. Let\u8217\'92s test your luck, maybe you find him afore me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb and Mandri spent the next hand and a half searching for Obo's body. They had no luck until Mandri got tired of looking and decided to apply himself. He realized that if he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been thrown clear of the destruction, then Obo probably had as well. From there they checked around where Mandri landed, and sure enough, there was Obo, still swaddled in black, poking out of the sand like a black grub. Seb didn\u8217\'92t want to touch Obo, so Mandri pulled him out alone, though this didn\u8217\'92t require much effort. Mandri found himself hoping that he\u8217\'92d feel Obo wiggle back to life once shaken, but no, he was as lifeless as the rest of the dead, though nearly weightless in comparison. And his skin was much paler, even by Obo\u8217\'92s standards.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 At Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s urging, Mandri carried the Mazid back to the makeshift camp in the middle of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s rubble, for that is where Ayram sat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The giant had his broad back turned, uncovered, and he was sitting on a wooden stool that had been scavenged from wreckage. The witch Elrahet was checking this incredible wall of flesh for wounds. The stool squeaked and groaned every time Ayram shifted his weight, but he was perfectly silent as the old witch sewed up a severe gash that wrapped around his side. As she worked, she washed away the sand from his tightly sculpted skin with a wet rag. The man was animal skinny and strong, and each time he lifted his arm to give Elrahet clearance to scrub, the striations in his shoulders popped and his shoulder blade melted into a pool of rippling muscle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He glanced over his shoulder and noticed Seb approaching empty handed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, you soilbucket! Did you find it?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb ducked under the words with a reverent bow. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When did I never do what I said I was gonna do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb stepped aside to reveal Mandri carrying the Mazid.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put it over there,\u8221\'94 Elrahet snapped as she pointed with her elbow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Laying on the ground nearby was the Mazidariga child, dead. Mandri laid Obo down next to it. Both were swaddled in black, with only their faces open to the air. They looked oddly like siblings\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 their skin had that same cloudy pallor. Obo was the bigger of the two, or he would have been if he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t had his legs chopped off.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram sighed and his shoulders slumped. Then he slapped his knees and stood up, against Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s protestations. He twisted back and forth to test the stitchwork that riddled his side, and when this sent a thin stream of blood dribbling down his ribs, he stole a long, thin strip of wool from a white Hrkan cloak and bandaged himself up. Elrahet tried to help, but he pointed with his bearded chin towards the twin corpses, Obo and the Riga.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go and do it,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet grumbled, then waddled over to the corpses and shooed Seb and Mandri aside. She then straightened the bodies out so that they lay flat on their backs, bellies even, and she knelt in between their heads, making sure the skirt of her robe folded nicely to make a pillow for her creaky knees. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From nowhere, that golden blade flashed in her hands, shining bright in the red light of the setting sun. The sight of it turned Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head craned towards the sky, and the speech that ushered from her throat was so polluted with guttural urks that Mandri wondered if they were even words. Not even the croaks of vomiting toads sounded so much like her gibberish. After the witch croaked through a garbled verse, she bent low over the Riga child and with her blade she cut the air around it, as if freeing it from some invisible tether, and when that was done she raised her arm and slammed her knife into Riga\u8217\'92s black-robed belly, burying the knife up to the hilt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Riga child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes flicked open and bulged as if trying to escape its skull, one red eye twisting left, the other twisting right. Mandri wondered if its brain might be exploding. Then the whole body juddered, and the little legs spasmed, kicking sand onto Ayram\u8217\'92s boot. Elrahet pushed down on the Riga\u8217\'92s hips with her free hand to steady the creature, and when the jerking finally settled down, she ripped the blade from the stomach, bent over the wound, then set her lips upon it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Every fiber of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s being wanted to look away from this unholy sight, but he couldn\u8217\'92t\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 such is the allure of dark and twisted things. The Riga wasn\u8217\'92t human, but it looked enough like an innocent child that Mandri felt shame for staring, and he nearly fainted when the witch slurped up blood from the hole in the Riga\u8217\'92s belly. A trickle of red dripped from her scrunched-up withered lips as she swung around to kiss the lips of Obo. But of course, it was more crude than a kiss\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she squeezed Obo\u8217\'92s jaw open, and spit the contents of her mouth into Obo\u8217\'92s throat. Out came blood and chunks of viscera, and so too came a formless gray light, the same glowing ember that Mandri had seen zip out of Obo\u8217\'92s body before the battle of Minting Rock began.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet shut Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw, clenched it tight with her leathery palm, and set to whispering that guttural language into Obo\u8217\'92s ear. She held her dagger aloft Obo\u8217\'92s throat and nicked the air above, seeming to brush Obo\u8217\'92s corpse with her blade as she played at guiding the ember down into his stomach. When she was finished, she set her ear to Obo\u8217\'92s heart, closed her eyes, and listened. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A stillness settled over those gathered as they waited for something magical to happen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s beady eye snapped wide as if struck by thunder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Boy! Quick!\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her eye fixed on Mandri and she  waved him towards her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hobbled over and she grabbed his wrist then yanked him down to his knees, right next to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Squeeze the hand,\u8221\'94 she said, and she held up her own bony claw of a hand to demonstrate, clutching some invisible stone and pumping it with her fist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri held up his hand and did the same.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She slapped him across the cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The other hand!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He held up his poulticed wrist. The weedy thing was no longer oozing black. Elrahet reached out with her knife, and with a quick flick she cut through the bandage that held it all together. The poultice meat sloughed off to reveal the nub of his wrist coated, and between the coin-splotches of dried black paste was a web of fresh pink skin. Though it was healed, it looked diseased against his natural brown complexion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Squeeze the hand ,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said as she rubbed Obo\u8217\'92s chest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri imagined his severed hand clutching Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s heart, and he squeezed with all his invisible might. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ribcage thumped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri gasped in shock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He squeezed again, and another thump bumped up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Harder,\u8221\'94 Elrahet growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s determination deepened, such that he was no longer breathing. Sweat beaded on his brow, and just when it seemed that he would faint, Obo opened his eyes. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol\u8217\'92s light,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered. He sat back into his heels and heaved a sigh of relief.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Bleary-eyed Obo slowly glanced around, first to his right, to Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sneering visage, then to Ayram\u8217\'92s blood spattered self, then to the black rubble of Minting Rock behind him, and then he squinted at the pile bodies beyond. When he turned his head and saw Mandri, his lips crumpled into a weak smile, broken when Ayram\u8217\'92s great paw gripped Obo\u8217\'92s whole head and lifted the Mazid up to lean him against a rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram turned to Mandri and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Command it. Make it do something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Make it hiss like a lizard.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The boy is not ready for true work,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93When his leg is mended, when his mind is steadied, then we shall make him Minder. A more urgent matter threatens our fate.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazidariga?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Damn right,\u8221\'94 said Seb, who was crouching nearby like a sandrat waiting for someone to drop a crumb of bread. Ayram silenced the wiry woman with a sideways glance, then he glowered at Obo and asked, \u8220\'93How many Mazidariga are there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 Obo answered. \u8220\'93More than one. Or rather, more than you can run from. You can be assured you will be hunted until killed. However, there is a peaceable solution to that particular problem which I\u8217\'92m sure you\u8217\'92ll find agreeable.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Out with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet snarled the answer. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazid wants a Spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but there is another way around the Riga.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Before I answer, I\u8217\'92d like to know why you took me captive. Don\u8217\'92t say it was to kill some demon. Do you want me to drive Hrk\u8217\'92s armies into the sea? Lay waste to every Hrkan temple? Kill every Lord? The prospective Lords, too?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram picked up his spear and began to wipe it with a rag. Both its ends, the chisel and ball, were solid red, as if made of a different metal.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t want you to kill a Lord. I don\u8217\'92t want you to kill a demon. I want you to kill the Amalgamete.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no use in it,\u8221\'94 Elrahet grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo was quick to counter her. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think that\u8217\'92s true. You see, if this is all an act of rebellion, then I am on your side. I would welcome a change in the continent\u8217\'92s leadership. The Lords are weak and fractious. They create more problems than they solve.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You aren\u8217\'92t getting a Spark,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet brusquely.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Simmer down, it\u8217\'92s only talk,\u8221\'94 said Ayram. \u8220\'93Either it says something sensible, or we ignore it.\u8221\'94 He leaned on his spear and asked intently, \u8220\'93How do we elude these Mazidariga demons?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Before I get to that, please, stop and consider\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what is the one thing the Hrkan Lords are scared of?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You?\u8221\'94 Elrahet grouched.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but no. You see, I was made to help manage that one thing that checks the Hrkan Lords\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that is the Hrkan people. You may think that I was made to terrorize you, but the Lords don\u8217\'92t care about the outland tribes. You\u8217\'92re tangential. In fact, they\u8217\'92ve sympathy for you if you can believe it. The guild is the only thing holding the common folk back from stealing what arable lands you people have left. If your goal is to plunge Hrk into chaos, you\u8217\'92ll be signing your own writ of doom.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram chuckled and shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know what the Hrkan people can do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why agitate them?\u8221\'94 Obo asked. The force of his argument was working an energy into him. If his arms were able to move underneath his swaddling robe, they would have been going mad. \u8220\'93If you want Hrk to fall cleanly, you have to be precise. You needn\u8217\'92t a Mazid to do this. Kill a few choice men and women, the ones keeping the corruption in check, as well as a few others who bridge the nation\u8217\'92s natural divisions. Apply some pressure to the right places, and Hrk will fall apart under its own weight. That would be a more manageable decline. It might take some time, but believe me, Hrk hates itself more than it hates you. Simply get them to no longer want to be a nation, and they won\u8217\'92t be. That will give your outland tribes room to breathe.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You speak as if you have experience tearing down kingdoms.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do you think Hrk tore down the Old Jandri world? It wasn\u8217\'92t Mazidfire. Disagreement is the natural impulse of your kind, prey on that, and any nation in the world would spiral into a cycle of death as soon as first blood is drawn.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The thing you don\u8217\'92t understand,\u8221\'94 said Ayram, \u8220\'93Is that I don\u8217\'92t care about Hrk. I don\u8217\'92t care about the outland tribes. What I do care about is killing the Amalgamete.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo looked deeply into Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes, as if to gauge the man\u8217\'92s sincerity. Mandri, in turn, looked to Elrahet, who was as set in stone as her leader. Seb seemed less convinced of the mission, though she was more difficult to read. It was difficult to know what lay behind her scowl at a glance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was probably nothing more than a too-sour borcandi spine, as a string of juice was dripping from her lip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 For Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s part, he was alarmed. He\u8217\'92d remembered what Ayram had named the Amalgamete back in the pit-cave\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he\u8217\'92d called it a god-swallower.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t understand,\u8221\'94 said Obo, stealing the words right out of Mandri\u8217\'92s mind. \u8220\'93If there\u8217\'92s this great evil running around, why not let Hrk deal with it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet thrust her cane in the air and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t have time for this!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo squirmed inside his black swaddling robe. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You went through all this, because you need me to kill a demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is the Lord of demons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not poke it with your spear?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How big?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram leaned on his spear and said firmly, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do we avoid the Mazidariga?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well that\u8217\'92s simple,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93Actually, the solution was in your grasp just now, but true to form you\u8217\'92ve squandered the opportunity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Out with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could capture a Riga after it has whistled the pseudospark out of my body, then you could walk wherever you please unmolested. You would then wake me once you reached your destination.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb stood up and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wait a finger\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 are you saying that we could have\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram waved Seb off, but Obo answered her anyway. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, you could have carried me and my poor cousin around the Sand free from the worry of the Hrkan hunt. Or, you could end all difficulties by giving me a Spark.\u8221\'94 He mounted his argument before anyone had time to laugh. \u8220\'93One distant whistle from a Mazidariga will end me. If I had my own shard of the divine, then it stands to reason that I would be freed from the Mazidariga\u8217\'92s influence entirely.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Free from the hunt,\u8221\'94 Ayram muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet added, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Freed from a Minder as well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93But if you give me a Spark, you would be giving me my freedom. I said it before and it will always be true\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in return for such a gift, I would slay anything you wished.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me, creature, if a true Spark danced in your belly, what would stop you from killing us? What would stop you from violating your word?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothing,\u8221\'94 Obo admitted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Behold!\u8221\'94 she shrieked. \u8220\'93A truth! None will come as quickly from a puppet\u8217\'92s tongue. I\u8217\'92d sooner trust the creature with a venomed blade than a Spark. We\u8217\'92re better off stumbling blind into a nest of battles.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram smirked. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll make do without its wisdom. And we should make ready. We\u8217\'92ll have to outpace the Hrks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To where?\u8221\'94 Obo asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We make for the bones of Bullr, then we head south to the Goree Mountains.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo was unimpressed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Bullr basin is surrounded by Hrkan posts. If there was a lord of demons dwelling anywhere near there, it would have been noticed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The demon isn\u8217\'92t hiding in the bones. It hides in the Goree.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grin spread wide inside the bloody bush of his beard. \u8220\'93This may surprise you, Mazid, but I can know things which I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo was not surprised. Neither was Mandri. The biggest of all outland pokes was unable to distinguish between knowledge and gut instinct\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this was one of the least surprising things in all of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s creation. Also unsurprising was the sad truth that other pokes went along with it. Absurd, but not surprising, as size is certainty in the Sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The only surprising bit was Elrahet. This woman had knowledge of the Spark, visions of the future, and yet, she was content to call herself Ayramun. It was because of her that Mandri feared the truth of the Amalgamete, though not just her. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d now met two witches wielding golden knives, and both speaking of a godlike being. Importantly, they didn\u8217\'92t disagree about this god\u8217\'92s existence, but whether or not it needed to be killed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri decided that Obo ought to know about that other witch, Pel, the one who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d started him on this journey. Perhaps it might change Obo\u8217\'92s mood if he knew that these pokes weren\u8217\'92t the only ones preaching about an Amalgamete. It might make Obo more amenable to his Minding. If the Amalgamete were real, then all of this might make sense.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He found himself hoping it was real. It would be a real shame for that big pile of bodies to mean absolutely nothing. If it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t mean anything, then any old passing artist could stumble by and make it mean whatever they wanted, and that would be a shame.}}
