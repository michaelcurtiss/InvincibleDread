\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s nothing complicated about terror. Mandri was all too familiar with its tired routine\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 first it startled him into stupidity, and then it spurred him into action, or petrified him, according to the flavor of the moment. There was no fighting it. When Elrahet suggested, in her witchy way, that the moment of truth was near, Mandri became terrified. He ran past that golden statue of Solraheen and made sure to kiss its hand, but that didn\u8217\'92t help at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Terror weakened his knees as he ran through the accursed temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bowels. He bumped his nose and toes on stone shelves and cabinet footings because he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed, according to Moto, because there wasn\u8217\'92t any time to light one up, even though it only took a moment. As it goes with terror\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 reason is not allowed a say. If it was, Mandri might have been able to sort through love and hate that he had for Moto and the rest of them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He hated these Ayramun for leading him here. He loved these Ayramun for protecting him from the dark. He hated them and loved them in equal turns. He wanted to flee and he wanted to stay close. Moto led them into a dark dead end, and Mandri hated him. Moto led them into a windowed hall flush with fresh night air, and Mandri loved him. Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated her. Mandri slipped on spot of Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated her\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Seb was the sole exception to this confusing succession of emotional states which blurred together. He pretty cleanly despised Seb by this point, but the others he loved and hated. And the fact that it was possible to love and hate a person in equal measure, suggested that these emotions were only crude approximations of a deeper reality which he could not articulate. It was as if there was a color portrait to be painted here, but all Mandri had were pigments black and white.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It reminded him, and this was not the time for it, but it reminded him of Solraheen, for His love was both comforting and terrifying. Yes, Mandri feared a loving Divine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He hated Elrahet for her witchy mumblings as she scampered along in the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This isn\u8217\'92t right,\u8221\'94 she hissed through clenched teeth. \u8220\'93Isn\u8217\'92t right, isn\u8217\'92t right, isn\u8217\'92t right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He loved her because she seemed to be the only one who knew what was going on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This way!\u8221\'94 she barked when Moto ran past a doorway, and she took the lead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah yanked Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put your sword away, you idiot!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even know he had it out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re going to stab me,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put it }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 away}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 .  Damn it Moto, why did you give him a sword?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade, and good thing he did, because Elrahet took a sharp turn into another dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are we doing?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked with venom.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto, the prime object of her ire, had lost his poise the moment everyone else stopped listening to him. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I say we }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 wait}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 here}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  for Ayram! And if I say it, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what we\u8217\'92ll do!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t act like you meant to run in here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was following Elrahet!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb sucked a hiss between her teeth. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So we jus\u8217\'92 bumblin\u8217\'92 around?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They all looked to Elrahet. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My foot is sore,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93I need off it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto moaned and smacked the wall in frustration. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is why I should be in charge. Ayram put }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 me}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  in charge. Now, I say we need to stop and }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 think,}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  because stumbling through the dark isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t doing any good. We don\u8217\'92t even know if the Amalgamete we seek is even in this accursed temple.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why wouldn\u8217\'92t it be?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look around! There\u8217\'92s no one to eat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri retreated into a dark corner of this small room as the others got into an argument about the Amalgamete\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dietary habits.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Was this creature always hunting, always looking for stomachs to eat? If it had eaten all three-thousand Greskalun, did it need to stop and sleep?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri wished this temple wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have been so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. It wasn\u8217\'92t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps because there weren\u8217\'92t any fittings  for candles or lamps bolted to the walls. Whoever built this place }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 wanted}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  it to be dark. This room had no hope of natural light\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Shulgi was much too thick in the belly for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help the unrighteous lose themselves, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 At least there was something to look at. Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around the blocky walls of this apparent dead end, and these rows were stacked upon the each other from floor to ceiling. The walls all throughout the place were carved up like this, and most were painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with lines of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears, there were garden scenes where Old Jandri kings strolled along in quiet contemplation, there were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dark brother, Schisol, burning martyrs who screamed as tongues of flame licked their skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that was being told. It reminded him of Hrkan tomb art\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a rich man decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when he dies and the tomb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s door is sealed, no one is allowed to have a look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and now no one is looking. A monumental waste of good pigment.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No places for candles in a tomb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No room for natural light either.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is this a tomb?\u8221\'94 he whispered over his shoulder to Obo. He was surprised to find that Obo had turned around in his litter and was peering over Mandri\u8217\'92s shoulder at the art.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If it were a tomb, then I think there would be writing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Right. But not necessarily. Image can convey the story as well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If there\u8217\'92s a narrative here, I\u8217\'92m having trouble reading it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri  agreed. He wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even sure if he were reading the panels in the correct direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether? He looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight. It was hard to see, because not only was the light too dim, but it blinked every time Moto waved his frantic arms to try and express his argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the moment of Solraheen\u8217\'92s birth, when He emerged out of void. It was represented here by a blank face floating above a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark ripping out the stone. Each gash was as wide as two of Mandri\u8217\'92s own fingers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh, guys.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The others were too engrossed in their squabble to hear him. Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri raised his voice, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They all stopped bickering and stared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri pointed at the beastly gash in Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s forehead. Seb stepped over and studied the defacement with a critical eye. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s just scratches.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see,\u8221\'94 Elrahet grumbled as she waved Mandri and Seb aside with her torch. She stood on her tiptoes and stretched her leathery neck to sniff it. When she balanced back down on her heels, her wrinkled face was gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is as I feared,\u8221\'94 she said bitterly, and she eyed those gathered with contempt, as if all this was somehow their fault. \u8220\'93No more mewling,\u8221\'94 she growled, and she pushed past Moto then trotted off into the darkness of the hallway, black robes fluttering, expecting everyone else to follow. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about Ayram?\u8221\'94 Moto whined as he took off after her. Moteah and Seb quickly followed, leaving Mandri and Obo alone in the pitch black room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri fished around in his robe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pocket for his burgeon. He wasn\u8217\'92t about to go running through a demon-infested temple with out some way seeing a demon before it jumps. The God\u8217\'92s Eye sight would surely reveal their Sparks, and whatever lines of purpose guided them as well. He unstopped his burgeon\u8217\'92s tiny thorn-plug, and he shook a drop of juice onto his outstretched tongue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His journey through the dark began anew. Elrahet led the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the scratches in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because where else would an Amalgamete dwell but deep? They ventured so far down into this temple mountain that it seemed to Mandri this building was upside down. A temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens. There should be an ascension to the roof where the penitent could await the coming dawn. But he went down, and the further down he went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet led them all down a wide fan of stairs whose ceiling and walls bowed out into a black void. They had stumbled into a monumental underground expanse, a throne room fit for a god. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts closed in on them. Suffice to say, Mandri no longer felt like he was \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91inside\u8217\'92, and despite his supreme misgivings, he soldiered on. It was a sea of darkness, and the Ayramun\u8217\'92s spot of torchlight was a dinghy set adrift. Mandri huddled close to the others, and if it weren\u8217\'92t for the hard stone under his feet, and the fractal cubic pattern etched onto it, he might have lost his wits completely.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That pattern was mesmerizing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hairs of black squares lining larger squares. As he walked this pattern gave way to a processional of obsidian-studded squares. This processional was straddled on either side by enormous stone columns shaped as legs, legs whose bodies disappeared into the interminable blackness above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet picked up speed and purpose, and she led them past these columns while Mandri prayed for the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye sight to come to him, that he might see whatever winged demons must be hiding in the shadows of the god-sized uglies above. But at pace, they reached the end of the hall unmolested. This end was a flat gray granite wall etched with carvings that matched the temple\u8217\'92s exterior\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 faces inside of faces, howling animals, untamed men, snarling demons, and all these faces radiated out of a central circle which ringed a red sandstone throne, a throne uplifted by of a narrow set of stairs. This throne\u8217\'92s seat and arms were smooth and featureless, fashioned from river-bloated stone, while its back was a billowing slab carved to look like flame licked into a curl by an unseen of wind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The throne\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s seat was as empty as the rest of the temple, which is to say it was filled with malevolent purpose. Mandri felt an unease come over him at the sight of it. He felt outnumbered against the great emptiness around him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s when noticed that Seb was missing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And the moment he noticed it, Moteah noticed it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The whites of her eyes bulged as she counted and counted again\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only four were present, only four, and she counted again as if it were possible to mess up one, two, three, four.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s\u8230\'85where\u8217\'92s Seb?!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The question choked her throat as she held her own torch out towards the void, hoping to catch sight of Seb lagging just behind\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no one was there. Nor were there footsteps. She was gone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto, upon seeing their number diminished by one, drew his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb!\u8221\'94 he shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch smacked his thigh with her cane.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quiet,\u8221\'94 she shushed. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ll wake Schisol Himself from the dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto set his disturbed temper upon Mandri. Suspicion skewed his brow. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is she?\u8221\'94 he demanded to know.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have no idea,\u8221\'94 Mandri replied, but Moto did not believe him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you do anything to her? Let me see your sword.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri fumbled at his sword\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hilt, and as he pulled it out he dropped it. The hilt and blade clanged on stone floor, and in this cavernous hall the noise was magnified into peal of thunder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto clenched his jaw tight and his eyes accused Mandri of dropping it on purpose. Then he lowered his torch over the blade and studied the sheen of light, looking for signs of use, but it was clean.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wait,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, confused. \u8220\'93You think I }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 stabbed }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb in the dark?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You or the Mazid,\u8221\'94 he growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo climbed up in his litter to peer over Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder. He tried to soothe Moto\u8217\'92s alarm by stating, calmly, \u8220\'93We didn\u8217\'92t do anything to the woman. In fact, I watched her scamper away from the group as soon as we entered the hall.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I watched her\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why didn\u8217\'92t you say anything?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am not the woman\u8217\'92s Minder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where did she go?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That way.\u8221\'94 Obo pointed to a perfectly square doorway which opened the wall to the right of the throne\u8217\'92s stairs. Moto moved towards it, but he stopped when Obo called, \u8220\'93I wouldn\u8217\'92t run so quick if I were you. There\u8217\'92s a foul smell coming from that hall.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Foul smell indeed,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet, and she brushed past Moto to take the lead again. Mandri picked up his sword, and he followed everyone else in chasing after the witch through the square doorway. This way led to another large hall, though much smaller than the throne room. Its length disappeared into darkness, but the ceiling and walls were brushed by the light of their torches.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t gotten twenty steps inside when she stopped cold.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She hunched over her cane and peered into the emptiness ahead. Mandri watched her aged face for some sign of fear. Her eye merely twitched. Then came a faint squelching sound that brought to mind Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s borcandi chewing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb!\u8221\'94 Moto shouted out. His holler drew an angry side-long glance from Elrahet, and if that wasn\u8217\'92t enough to shut him up, a voice rose out of the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was not Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed Shulgi itself was speaking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Welcome, witch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This unaccounted for voice rooted them all to the spot. Mandri wanted desperately to flee but somehow couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t. He watched on in astonishment as Moto broke out of this spell, and he reached back with his torch and threw it straight down the hall, towards the voice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The flaming stick went spinning through the air, and it flew at least forty yards before it clattered onto the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop at the distant wall, a wall composed of some peculiar material that looked a bit like rough-hewn stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They wish to see my glory,\u8221\'94 said the voice. \u8220\'93Let them see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Two enormous braziers on either wall erupted into flame, illuminating what Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s torch could not, for the distant wall was not a stone wall, it was a colossal mound of flaking skin warted over with bleeding pustules and tags of fat, and this swell of flesh was so large that it plugged the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The whole horrible thing shook as as the rasping voice sounded out again, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Behold, my glory!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The mound of flesh rolled forward, and sticking out of it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s top, like a cork in a winebag, was the upper body of a skinny old man, white-bearded, shawled in a shimmering green robe. On his head was a crown, and his arms clutched a woman\u8217\'92s headless body.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This putrid king smiled in the fire\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s upshot light, and this smile grew and grew until his jaw dislocated off his skull like a snake\u8217\'92s. He shoved Seb\u8217\'92s lolling head into his gaping maw, and after he stretched his cheeks beyond reason to accommodate her shoulders, he crunched down onto her spine and began to chew.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A scream of terror died stillborn in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s throat, for arrayed around this bloated beast\u8217\'92s belly were demon roaches the size of dogs, at least ten of them, with oily-black shells and human hands sprouting out the ends of their segmented legs. Their faces were an unholy mix between a insect\u8217\'92s and a man\u8217\'92s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling. Their mouths gulped the air like fish out of water.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Standing amongst them was a man, a white-robed man, large but dwarfed by a single fold of the bloated king\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s skin. It was none other than Salavan, the Governor of Meskalim, the man who\u8217\'92d killed Mandri all those moons ago. His white beard broke into a satisfied grin at the sight of Mandri, and he set his hand on the shoulder of a child at his side.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A pale child wrapped in black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A Mazidariga.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The sight of the Riga spurred Mandri into motion. He turned to flee, but was stopped by the sight of four demon beetles stuck to the wall above the exit. They clicked their legs against their shells like off-the-wagon addicts.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Before Mandri could even think about being brave, the Mazidariga whistled it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tinny song. At first, it was a startling trill, but it soon pitched into a mind splitting squeal which dropped Mandri to his knees. He cowered against it, and prayed a broken prayer between gasps as Obo convulsed inside his litter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But the whistling did not last long, and as soon as it stopped, Mandri shrugged himself out of the litter\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s straps and turned around to discover that Obo had gone limp.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Mazidariga had sucked Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pseudospark clean from his body.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo was effectively dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Their entire plan to kill the Amalgamete died with him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re doomed,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No one heard him, for there were more frightening things at hand. Moto and Moteah had their swords drawn, and their eyes wer set on the darkness of the ceiling above where two demon beetles were lurking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are those things?!\u8221\'94 Moto cried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hag beetles,\u8221\'94 Elrahet answered, unafraid. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92ve spines that stab out from inside their shells\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 careful when they open.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hag beetles?\u8221\'94 Salavan said from all the way across the room. \u8220\'93They are not hag beetles. They have no names. Keep your names to yourself, witch!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet took a step towards Salavan and bowed, as if petitioning an ordinary outland court. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Steward of the most repugnant king,\u8221\'94 she said in mocking reverence, \u8220\'93None are worthy of a names, and yet Solraheen provides us all with names.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old king\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes rolled back as he continued to swallow Seb whole. Salavan stood in awe below him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A name?\u8221\'94 said Salavan. \u8220\'93Poison yourselves with your names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. My God and His are more than any name can bear. Look at Him!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Salavan spread his arms. The width was a tiny measure against his God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s monstrous girth. The whole mass of the beast then shivered, for up above, the king\u8217\'92s distended ribcage squeezed Seb\u8217\'92s body down into his bloated stomach. The sight of his black tongue licking down Seb\u8217\'92s toes was almost more than Mandri could bear, and this was followed by the crack of his jaw snapping back into place.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet watched all this with a scornful glare. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have perverted your flesh, Greskal,\u8221\'94 she said, heaping ridicule upon the name.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But the putrid king, this false-god, he only laughed, and his laugh sent a shudder through his whole bloated body, ending in a horrible burp.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ugh-urp-huh-huhhh\u8230\'85 Greskal?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He leaned his whole bulk forwards to resettle his great stomach. Mandri suspected that somewhere under the calloused flabs of skin on the floor were legs, but he doubted this demon king could do much more than lean.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am not Greskal\u8230\'85No, I am no longer Greskal\u8230\'85I have become\u8230\'85I have become, becoming itself! Name me, witch\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 I am Amalgamete!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The echo of his voice filled the hall and stunned all gathered into silence, all save the hag beetles, who chattered and clicked their chitinous mouths, vibrating with their master\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you think me ugly?\u8221\'94 the Amalgamete said. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from tar, living tar, for in the dim light it seemed to be wriggling like a piglet. He pulled it further and let it slip, and the flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This flesh is the world,\u8221\'94 the Amalgamete decreed as he caressed the welling redness. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you see? This pain of flesh is the pain of the world into which a Spark thrown. The brighter the light of the Spark, the more this filth gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would supplicate yourselves before me as your God!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet looked down her nose at this self-proclaimed god. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your son had a stronger stomach than you,\u8221\'94 she growled. \u8220\'93Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A paroxysmal twitch shuddered the Amalgamete\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bulk. He pointed to Elrahet and bellowed, \u8220\'93Silence that Spark ensnaring womb!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A hag beetle dropped from the ceiling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It fell with tremendous speed, and as it did, its shell split open, revealing a black, insectoid spike which shot out and jabbed at Elrahet, but the old witch merely stepped aside and dodged it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetle crashed into the floor, and Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sword lashed out severed the spike from the beetle\u8217\'92s body.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Amalgamete belched in annoyance as his wounded child scurried away. Then he issued a royal plea. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Offer yourselves willingly. Be joined together inside my stomach and know union for once in your miserable lives.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His servant, Salavan, was quick to clarify, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Please do not struggle. Stressed meat tastes fouler.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then, with the natural grace of a man made king from birth, the Amalgamete twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, and waved his minions onward.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Both Moto and Moteah threw down their packs, and they shielded Elrahet behind them. Mandri held his own sword out before him, though he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know what to do with it, so he assumed responsibility for watching their backs. He turned once more towards the exit, and he suddenly regretted not paying Moto\u8217\'92s fighting lesson any mind. Then again, even if he had paid attention, it wouldn\u8217\'92t have prepared him to deal with an eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis. And there were four of them arrayed above that square doorway. And he had to fight off all of them all at once.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do I do!?\u8221\'94 he screamed at siblings.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just stab the damned things!\u8221\'94 Moteah cried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri readied himself to stab, and the next thought that went through his head was that things seem to move faster when they were moving straight at him, for one of those beetles had jumped right at him, and as it sped through the air its shell parted open and a blur shot out of it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrieked, swung out with his sword, but it swung unbothered for his vision flashed with the white light of purpose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye sight had blinded him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not now!\u8221\'94 he screamed as his vision plunged into a swirling sea of iridescent light. He cursed his unluck that the burgeon should strike him in this crucial moment. He ducked to dodge the leaping beetle, he ducked low to the ground, and he prayed for Solraheen to protect him\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it spoke no words, it was a stronger prayer than that, it was burst of raw emotion. Though his plea was honest, he still expected to feel a spike pierce through his neck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When that didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t happen, he opened his eyes and praised the wonder of being alive.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Even more astonishing was the demon beetle twitching at his feet. It lay belly-up, and it had been crushed. And the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye sight was here, and it revealed the beetle\u8217\'92s bright yellow Spark lying inside its juddering stomach. Stretching out of that Spark was a single thread of bright white purpose, and that shimmering thread was drawn into an arc leading up, where it was stuck to the chisel-tip head of Ayram\u8217\'92s iron spear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri sighed in awe at Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s miraculous presence, and he flinched in fright as Ayram rammed his spear down onto the beetle\u8217\'92s belly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetle spasmed, its Spark dimmed, and its legs twitched feebly a moment more.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The three other beetles, seeing this, scurried up to the ceiling and fled back down the hall, towards the Amalgamete.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thank god,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered as he basked in Ayram\u8217\'92s radiance, for the giant\u8217\'92s Spark shone brightly, and it was woven into a web of purpose which seemed to cradle Mandri\u8217\'92s weary head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah rushed over to Ayram and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s wrong?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Got stabbed by a Skulsi,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. \u8220\'93Arm\u8217\'92s useless.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Indeed, Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left arm was tucked into his robe, and the manwinced as he rolled that shoulder to test it. But then Ayram caught sight of Obo, who lay limp on the floor next to Mandri. He looked for answer and found it in the Mazidariga child hugging Salavan\u8217\'92s leg. As Ayram put this little puzzle together, his stern confidence cracked. His people were reduced to three, and he saw no hope in any of them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But he did not see what Mandri saw.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He did not have the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye sight. Without it, he might as well have been blind. He was ignorant to the fact that Elrahet\u8217\'92s golden Spark was as bright as the sun, and she was swarmed by threads of purpose which clouded her figure in light. Some of these threads extended out of the room in either direction, and some shot straight up through the ceiling. It was clear to Mandri, that at least her purpose did not end inside this room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But neither was ultimate victory certain, for she was outshone by the Amalgamete, whose Spark was a constellation of shimmering spheres of light, every size and color, and all of them were webbed together inside his bloated stomach. Mandri watched in wonder as these glowing links pulsed, merged, and split apart, while some knots popped like bubbles into sparkling rainbow dust which coalesced into new lines of purpose that stretched out into the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If he were not a god, then he was close to it, for only something divine could build new lines of purpose and set the world into motion. But it was not easy, as all the while, the beast was lost in the throes of some belly-aching fit. It seemed as if the skinny king on top was about to vomit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Down below, Salavan appeared oblivious to his foul master\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pains. He smiled at the sight of Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Welcome!\u8221\'94 he shouted as if greeting a long lost friend. \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ve been expecting a big man such as you. We have gifts for all of you, if you\u8217\'92ll only wait a moment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not interested,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled as he lofted his spear onto his good shoulder and stepped towards the evil gathered across the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, come,\u8221\'94 said Salavan, beckoning. \u8220\'93But I won\u8217\'92t have that rudeness. Give the good lord a moment and he\u8217\'92ll give back a blessed eternity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The putrid king rolled his eyes into white and he punched his body hard enough to knock loose some internal blockage. He moaned and threw his whole head back as his shoulders cringed and quivered. A cosmic wave rolled under his great bulk and the constellation inside his stomach rolled inside his innards. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder, and the Sparked web was pulled and stretched until a glob or red light snapped loose. When it did, the king above coiled up and screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A boil the size of a wagon wheel burst open. Blackness oozed out of this new cavity, and when the next shudder came this hole ripped wider. Out of this orifice poured a great red lizard demon slathered in tar, Sparked, it seemed, by fire.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Half woman, it stood up on two legs. Half keenkedra, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It wore the muscles of a prize-winning ox, and when it stood up to its full height, it was bigger than Ayram by a head. Its eyes, double lidded, were blood red like its scales, and its pupils reflected the fiery glow of its murderous Spark. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beast licked the air with a forked tongue, and it hissed as it stretched out its limbs for the first time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 its arms were ribbons of muscle, its back a whip, its jaw was full of hateful fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself and delighted in the power.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It set its glowing eyes on Ayram, and let loose a low, purring hiss. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In response, the hag beetles all clicked and scratched their spikes insides their shells before turning their dumb, lidless eyes back towards the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then they began to crawl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get out!\u8221\'94 Ayram shouted. \u8220\'93Flee!\u8221\'94 He twirled his spear under his good right arm and spat a challenge towards the newborn freak. A snarl of fangs was the reply, and the lizard demon took one step towards its prey.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetles, still clicking their excitement, scurried wide around both giants, while Moto and Moteah herded Mandri and Elrahet into a corner. The hag beetles closed ranks behind Ayram, though they weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t at all interested in him. They kept on creeping along the hall, while their numbers on the ceiling swelled. Mandri could just make out the dull shine of eyes as one darted into the darkness directly above him. He couldn\u8217\'92t see it\u8217\'92s shape, but he knew it was there, for he could see its yellow Spark, and attached to it was a single thread of inevitable purpose which was stuck to his own poor stomach.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He tried to cut this thread with his sword, but the blade wafted right through it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then he heard Ayram roar, and the distance between him and the demon was closed so fast that it seemed only a single leap. The thunder clap of their meeting unleashed chaos in the room. So much happened so fast that Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t keep track.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Down on the floor, three beetles jumped at once\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 maybe it was more, Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure because the rush of bodies, limbs, and twisting threads of fate blurred all motion beyond bewilderment. At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. And before Mandri could raise his sword, Moto brought his own blade down on the hag beetle\u8217\'92s back. In a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue right behind the beetle\u8217\'92s head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him. Though its head tumbled to the floor, its body wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t fully dead, instead it seized up, and one of its human-handfeet slapped Mandri in the cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri would have laughed if it weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t for the sight of that hag beetle up on the ceiling dropping down, and things seemed to fall faster when they were falling straight at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle\u8217\'92s neck and into Mandri\u8217\'92s face. But this was not enough to obscure his sight of the lines of purpose, and one of these white filaments extended out from the attacking beetle\u8217\'92s back and ran a worrisome arc right through the center of his forehead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spike flew out of its back, and thanks to the guiding light, Mandri was able to duck out of the way.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The spike retracted, then struck out again, and Mandri ducked again, careful to keep his ear out of the bright white arc which mapped the spike\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s path through the future.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri laughed, because he felt like he was cheating, and twice more, the bumbling spike tapped against the stone next to his cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Idiot!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lidless saucer eyes were staring down right at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, sorry.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri tugged hard on the dead body between them, and as the spike flew down once more it met instead with the dead beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shell. Mandri hid himself underneath this carapace as the beetle tried to smash through it, and he hid like this until, by the grace of Solraheen, that dumb beetle\u8217\'92s severed head fell right in front of his nose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah pulled her sword out of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get up!\u8221\'94 she urged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles, but his hips and thighs were pinned. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kick it off me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah kicked the top beetle off him. Mandri was able to push himself free from the other, and he got to his feet. He wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smushed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back across the hall. One of these hags ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the newborn demon, and that beetle was sliced in half by the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s thrashing tail.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his iron spear so fast that it seemed to curve, and it snapped suddenly straight against the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fending tail. Sparks flew, the demon recoiled and raged, then it leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand. Ayram sidestepped, and the demon followed through with its tail to knocked Ayram\u8217\'92s spear aside just as the next spinning set of talons were coming round.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below a beheading blow, and he leapt away, leaving nothing but a swirl of dust between them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Not only were their movements fraught with impressive power, but their limbs traced through swirling white arcs of purpose. It was a moving image which melted Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind. He resolved then and there to apologize to Moto if they ever made it through this alive, as this fight was indeed a work of wondrous art, as captivating as any other, as revealing, as honest, and it had him rapt in core-collapsing wonder. And when the giants paused their brawl to gather themselves, Mandri saw how badly they\u8217\'92d ravaged each other. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The demon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram\u8217\'92s robe was half-clawed off and ribbons of his flesh hung down his side, exposing the yellow fat, the red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time he exhaled.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The swirl of white light that was Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rump.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Help him!\u8221\'94 she shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag beetles easily enough, but this newborn was an enemy beyond them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go!\u8221\'94 Elrahet screamed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah took off running towards the battle, her purpose clear. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first. He followed her, and they got halfway towards Ayram when the demon noticed their coming. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and it crouched down like a cat to retreat back down the hall. Its long tail was raised like that of a scorpion. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet turned to Mandri and drew her golden blade. He could not see her face through the bright white shroud of purpose, so all he could make of her intent was the way her hand trembled as it lifted the knife up above her head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri panicked. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing?!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch thrust her knife downwards in a swift stroke.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But it was not aimed Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She brought it down upon her own bright purpose, and the golden blade, curved and gleaming, sliced right through the shimmering threads. The frayed ends splayed out into a tufted cloud, and Elrahet emerged from this cocoon, clad in her usual black robed, leathery self. An eye blink later, and she was completely free all divine light, save for the light of her Spark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It had only taken one cut\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 one swift cut to unwed herself from the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She smiled at Mandri, a gummy, toothless smile. Mandri was utterly confused as to what all this could possibly mean, but there was no time to wonder, for in the distance behind Elrahet he saw the newborn demon jump all the way up to the ceiling. It bounded off it, and its arc carried it over the heads of the three warriors. It hit the ground running straight for Mandri and Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled hiss underneath its permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift strides, and its final leap was tremendous. The sheer size of it could crush them both, but curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The demon rolled under it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram missed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In committing himself to the blow he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d left himself open to the lizard\u8217\'92s scything tail, which did not miss\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it ripped a gash right across Ayram\u8217\'92s chest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The lizard demon then crashed into Mandri and Elrahet and sent them sprawling. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri recovered a moment later, he expected to see the demon hollowing out his head, but its great arm lay atop him, lifeless. Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s golden blade was hilted in the top of its skull.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri pushed himself out from under the dead creature, and he looked for the old witch that he might thank her, but he found her lying on her side with his own sword sticking out of her stomach. A chill of horror crawled through his skin as realized that he must have accidentally stabbed her in the flurry. He rushed over and tried to help, but could tell form the absence of breath that she was already dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A gargling gasp sounded out from behind, and Mandri spun in fright. There was Ayram, Ayram and a river of blood flowing out from the fissure in his chest. He gasped again and he dropped to his knees, then fell backwards. Moto, sprinting up from behind, caught the giant\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fall. Moteah was there too, though she kept on running, and when she caught sight of Elrahet dead by Mandri\u8217\'92s blade, she screamed a shriek of grief and hopelessness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She huddled over Elrahet. Her shaking hands could not believe the blood which wet Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s black robes. She wiped them on her lap, then brushed the old witch\u8217\'92s hair with dewy eyed devotion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They come!\u8221\'94 Moto hollered, and he lay Ayram down before turning to face the onrushing beetle horde.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let them come,\u8221\'94 Moteah said as she gnashed her teeth and fought back tears. But she thought better of it when she saw her brother\u8217\'92s leg get sliced by beetle\u8217\'92s stabbing spine. She picked up her sword again, roared her fighting fury, then ran to join her brother\u8217\'92s futile act of bravery and defiance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stayed by Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s side. He could see that her golden Spark was still there, if  dimmed, but certainly still there\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 his blade was stuck right through it. And there was still one thread of purpose sprouting out of it. It was thin, almost invisible, and it was tethered to Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri pulled his sword out of her belly and cast it aside. Then set his lips to her wound, and he sucked her Spark into his mouth. This pure divinity sloshed atop his tongue and the taste of it filled his whole being with ecstasy. The urge to swallow was overwhelming, but that was not what he was meant to do, for a thread of purpose tethered him to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s corpse, and it was shining bright.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hustled over to Obo and squeezed his jaw open. He spit Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Spark into the Mazid\u8217\'92s mouth. He drew back, hoping that he was done and that Obo would rise, but the Spark simply puddled in the back of Obo\u8217\'92s throat and did nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri recalled how Elrahet had muttered some guttural speech to bring Obo back after Minting rock. It had sounded like Old Jandri. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know Old Jandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know any invocations or incantations which might reweave the threads of purpose, or direct a Spark to his will. The only sacred words he knew were from a Solitant ritual in which he was fed a still-living snail. And that couldn\u8217\'92t be relevant, because that ritual\u8217\'92s purpose wasn\u8217\'92t life affirming, it was life denying. The priest said that Life is terrifying thing. Life kills. Life kills, and it eats what it kills, and for some reason, people fear death. Yes, that is what makes life, life\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it kills and eats, and it kills and it eats, and so one should not fear death, fear life! And the words the Solitants spoke as he swallowed that slug were simple.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Consumed by the body}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \tab So that it can}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Feed the Spark}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \tab So that it can}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Move the flesh}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \tab So that it can be}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a mantra which could only be completed when repeated. Mandri spoke it, and he repeated it, and as he whispered it to Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Spark he willed it to move with his feeling as well. To his delight, a tiny thread of purpose stretched out of that Spark and wandered down Obo\u8217\'92s throat. It wiggled like a worm seeking sustenance. Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t sure whether his ritual refrain or his raw desiring drew that thread into being, so he continued on doing both, and he strained with the effort. The harder he focused, and the more he lost himself in the flow of words and emotion, the further the thread traveled on. It went taught when it hit the Mazid\u8217\'92s stomach, and suddenly the shimmering gold Spark zipped down to take up residence in Obo\u8217\'92s belly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whole body pulsed with light, and he awoke with a fresh face, and bright eyes, as if nothing had happened at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He sat up, alert as ever.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hello Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri simply pointed down the hall, where Moto and Moteah had their backs against the wall, surrounded by a gang of beetles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh,\u8221\'94 said Obo, and as casually as the sun defeats the night, he opened his mouth and shot a golden beam of Mazidfire through the room. He swiped it in a downwards arc, and all at once, a line of twelve demon beetles were cut in half.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Amalgamete unleashed a dreadful, squelching scream.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93AIIIEEEEEEEEEGHHhhhhghghh!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He was not at all pleased to see Obo burn his children. And he was not at all pleased to find himself afraid. And his fear was reflected in the eyes of the white-robed Salavan, who was busy trying to squeeze his own great bulk between a fold of fat and the hallway\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall. But he was too slow to flee\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a blast of Mazidfire shot out and burned right through his skull. The young Mazidariga was dealt a similar indignity, while Obo saved the Amalgamete for last. Upon this fearsome beast, Obo let loose a powerful bolt of purging fire, but the flame merely smashed into the flesh and fizzled, leaving only a scorch mark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo resummoned his fire and he held it steady. He held that beam so long that his own throat heated up to incandescence, but soon this roaring flame popped through one of the Amalgamete\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s great sores and it poured into the demon king\u8217\'92s stomach, heating the insides, boiling them up, sending sputtering, bubbling blobs of super-heated steaming bile splashing out. Up above, a hiss of steam shot out of the putrid king\u8217\'92s throat. When Obo finally calmed his fire, the whole beast slumped down, deflated, and it appeared to melt into a simmering puddle of its own black bile and blood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Amalgamete was dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 What beetles were still alive went scurrying into the darkness beyond. Obo was content to rub his throat and watch them leave. Meanwhile, Moteah collapsed in exhaustion, and Moto shook his head in disbelief at the dead Amalgamete.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then he eyed Obo and snorted. He seemed as displeased to see the Obo moving as he was pleased at the sight of his boot kicking a hag beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head across the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you upset?\u8221\'94 Obo asked him. \u8220\'93Would you prefer to have lost?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 have}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  lost!\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Moto shouted. \u8220\'93Ayram is dead!

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So? SO!? That witch was the last vestige of Solraheen\u8217\'92s grace on this earth, and Mandri killed her. She\u8217\'92d battled evil for untold ages, and now she\u8217\'92s gone. She is gone, and her enemy still lives. Who do }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  think will win the next battle?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are referring to Schisol\u8217\'92s consort?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who else?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s question went unanswered, but not because it flustered Obo. Obo was simply unconcerned.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But Mandri was concerned. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d played too big a role in all this for it to end badly. Guilt forced him to blurt out, \u8220\'93Why not kill the other witch? The evil witch. We have Obo, we have his Mazidfire. Let\u8217\'92s find her and kill her.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That sounds like a reasonable solution.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t kill her,\u8221\'94 Moto said. His calm delivery belied the fact that his frustration was boiling over. \u8220\'93No one but a god can kill a consort of the divine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then how did Mandri manage to do it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The tension in Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders snapped, and he stammered out a meek, \u8220\'93I have no idea.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri snickered and gathered himself together. He picked up Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter and carried it over to the Mazid, then patted him on the shoulder. \u8220\'93Let me carry you for another while,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s go found another enemy to burn.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo smiled and climbed into the litter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about you two?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked the siblings. \u8220\'93Are you coming?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are you going?\u8221\'94 Moteah countered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s got to be a  demon hole in the ground around here somewhere. I\u8217\'92m sure Shis can\u8217\'92t be far away. What else are you going to do? You\u8217\'92re committed to ending evil, right? Well, let\u8217\'92s end it.\u8221\'94}}
