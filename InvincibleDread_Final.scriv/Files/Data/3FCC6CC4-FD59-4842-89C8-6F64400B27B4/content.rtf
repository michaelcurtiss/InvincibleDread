\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s nothing complicated about terror. First it startled Mandri into stupidity, and then it spurred him into action, or petrified him, according to the flavor of the moment. There was no fighting it. When he saw that hag-beetle, he became terrified, and that terror gained on him as he fled with the others through the temple\u8217\'92s bowels.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He bumped his nose and toes on stone shelves and cabinet footings because he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed, according to Moto, because there wasn\u8217\'92t any time, even though Moto took time to light one up for himself. Mandi thought Moto was being unreasonable, but that\u8217\'92s how it goes with terror, it pushes reason aside. Hard to be reasonable when there\u8217\'92s a demon clicking its teeth somewhere in the dark behind them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He hated these Ayramun for leading him here, but he also loved these Ayramun for protecting him from the dark. He wanted to flee from them, and he wanted to stay as close as he could. Moto led them into a dark dead end, and Mandri hated him. Moto led them into a windowed hall flush with fresh night air, and Mandri loved him. Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated her. Mandri slipped on a spot of Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated her\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Seb was the sole exception to this alternating succession of stresses which blurred together. He despised Seb entirely, but the others he loved and hated, or was it hated and loved. The fact that it was possible to love and hate a person suggested that these emotions were only crude approximations of a deeper reality which he could not articulate. It was as if there was a color portrait to be painted here, but all he had were pigments of black and white.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then there were the beetles, haunting the dark halls behind. His fear of them mixed in with all of this. It reminded him, and this was not the time for it, but it reminded him of Solraheen, for His love was both comforting and terrifying. Yes, Mandri feared a loving Divine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He hated Elrahet for her witchy mumblings as she scampered along in the dark, her torch bobbing right and left.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This isn\u8217\'92t right,\u8221\'94 she hissed through clenched teeth. \u8220\'93Isn\u8217\'92t right, isn\u8217\'92t right, isn\u8217\'92t right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then he loved her when she took the lead and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This way!\u8221\'94 like she knew where she was going.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah had been right behind Mandri this whole time, and she yanked on Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put your sword away, you idiot!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even know he had it out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re going to stab me,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re going to stab somebody if you don\u8217\'92t put it }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 away}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 . Damn it Moto, why did you give him a sword?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade, and good thing he did, because Elrahet suddenly took a sharp turn into another dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are we doing?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked with venom, begging to lead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 By this point Moto had lost his poise. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I say we }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 wait}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 here}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  for Ayram! And if I say it, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what we\u8217\'92ll do!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah sneered and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You want to wait here for the beetles to find us?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Better to fight here than in the hall!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb sucked in a hiss between her teeth. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So we jus\u8217\'92 bumblin\u8217\'92 around?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They all looked to Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My foot is sore,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said. \u8220\'93I need off it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto groaned and smacked the wall in frustration. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is why I should be in charge. Ayram put }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 me}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  in charge. Now, I say we need to stop and }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 think,}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  because stumbling through the dark isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t doing any good.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And how would you know?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s got to be another exit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri retreated into a dark corner of the room as the others got into an argument about how thinking about finding an exit could possibly help them find it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri wished this temple wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. It wasn\u8217\'92t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps because there weren\u8217\'92t any fittings for them bolted onto the walls. Whoever built this place wanted it to be dark. This room had no hope of natural light\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Shulgi was much too thick in the belly for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help the unrighteous lose themselves, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 At least there was something to look at. Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around the blocky walls of this apparent dead end, and these rows were stacked upon each other from floor to ceiling. All the walls were carved up like this, and most were painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with lines of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears. There were garden scenes where Old Jandri kings strolled along in quiet contemplation. There were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dark brother, Schisol, burning martyrs who screamed as tongues of flame licked their skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that the images told. It reminded him of Hrkan tomb art\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a rich man decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when he dies and the tomb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s door is sealed, no one is allowed to have a look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and then no one is looking. A monumental waste of good pigment.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No places for candles in a tomb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No room for natural light either.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Maybe this place was to be a tomb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Unfortunately, Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quite sure what he was looking at in terms of narrative. He wasn\u8217\'92t even sure if he were reading the panels in the right direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight. It was hard to see, because not only was the light too dim, but it blinked every time Moto waved his frantic arms to try and express his argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the moment of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s birth, when He emerged out of the Void. It was represented here by a blank face floating above a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark ripping out the stone. Each gash was as wide as two of Mandri\u8217\'92s own fingers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh, guys.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The others were too engrossed in their squabble to hear him. Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri raised his voice, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They all stopped bickering and stared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri pointed at the beastly gash in Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s forehead. Seb stepped over and studied the defacement with a critical eye. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s just scratches.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see,\u8221\'94 Elrahet grumbled as she waved Mandri and Seb aside with her torch. She stood on her tiptoes and stretched her leathery neck to sniff it. When she balanced back down on her heels, her wrinkled face was gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is as I feared,\u8221\'94 she said bitterly, and she eyed those gathered with contempt, as if all this was somehow their fault. \u8220\'93No more mewling,\u8221\'94 she growled, and she pushed past Moto, then trotted off into the darkness of the hallway, black robes fluttering, expecting everyone to follow. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are we going?\u8221\'94 Moto roared as he took off after her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To find a way out!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah and Seb quickly followed, leaving Mandri alone with Obo strapped to his back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri fished around in his robe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pocket for his burgeon. He wasn\u8217\'92t about to go running through a demon-infested temple without some way to see those damned beetles before they jumped. The God\u8217\'92s Eye sight would surely reveal their Sparks and whatever lines of purpose guided them, so he pulled his burgeon out, unstopped its tiny thorn-plug, and shook a drop of juice onto his outstretched tongue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His journey through the dark temple halls began anew. Elrahet led the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the scratches in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was a choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because where else would a desert exit be but at the bottom of the mountain? They ventured so far down into this temple that it seemed to Mandri the building was upside down. A temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens. There should be an ascension to the roof where the penitent could await the coming dawn. But he went down, and the further down he went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet led them all down a wide fan of stairs. The ceiling and walls bowed out into a black void. They stumbled into a monumental underground expanse, a throne room fit for a god. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts were closing in. It was a sea of darkness, and the Ayramun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spot of torchlight was a dinghy set adrift in it. Mandri huddled close to the others, and if hadn\u8217\'92t felt the hard stone under his feet, he might have lost his wits completely.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That stone had a fractal pattern etched into it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hairs of black squares lining larger squares. As he walked, this pattern gave way to a procession of obsidian-studded squares straddled on either side by enormous stone columns shaped as legs, legs whose bodies disappeared into the interminable blackness above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet picked up speed and purpose. She led them past these columns while Mandri prayed for the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye sight to come to him, that he might see whatever demons must be hiding in the shadows above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 At pace, they reached the end of the hall unmolested, and uplifted there, on a narrow set of stairs, was a red sandstone throne. This throne\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s seat and arms were smooth and featureless, fashioned from river-bloated stone, while its back was a billowing slab carved to look like flame licked into a curl by an unseen wind. Etched into the wall behind was a ring of faces, faces inside of faces\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 howling animals, untamed men and women, as well as snarling demons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The throne\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s seat was as empty, which is to say it was filled with dark, malevolent purpose. Mandri felt outnumbered against the great emptiness around him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s when he noticed that Seb was missing. And the moment he noticed it, Moteah noticed it too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The whites of her eyes bulged as she counted and counted again\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only four were present. Only four. She counted again as if it were possible to mess up one, two, three, four.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s\u8230\'85where\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The question choked her throat as she peered into the darkness behind, hoping to catch sight of Seb, but no one was there. Nor were there footsteps. Seb was gone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto spun around, and upon seeing their number diminished by one, he charged back into the darkness from whence they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d come. He hadn\u8217\'92t gotten far when he stopped and waved his torch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb!\u8221\'94 he shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A silence, followed by Elrahet grumbling, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ll wake Schisol Himself from the dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto spun around. Suspicion skewed his brow. He marched up to Mandri and grabbed Mandris\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92 robe. \u8220\'93Where is she?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have no idea,\u8221\'94 Mandri replied.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see your sword.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri fumbled at his sword\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hilt. As he pulled it out he dropped it. It clanged on the stone floor, and in this cavernous hall the noise was magnified to a peal of thunder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto clenched his jaw tight and his eyes accused Mandri of dropping the sword on purpose. Then he lowered his torch to the blade and studied the sheen of light playing upon it. He was looking for signs of use.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wait,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, confused. \u8220\'93You think I }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 stabbed }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb in the dark?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How else did she disappear?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not like we\u8217\'92re in a demon infested temple.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You were running right behind her!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto swung the torch back up and nearly smacked Mandri in the face with it. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did a demon drop on top of her and carry her away without you seeing? \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 I mean, I don\u8217\'92t know. Maybe.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Just then, a blood curdling scream echoed through the hall. The sound came from behind the throne, through a perfectly square doorway cut into the wall near the throne\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stairs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet took off running towards it. Moto and Moteah followed. Mandri picked up his sword, and though he wanted no part of chasing that scream, the Ayramun were taking their torches with them. He followed everyone else through that square doorway and found another large hall whose length disappeared into darkness. Thankfully, the tall ceiling and walls were brushed with light. There were no demons crawling on them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet had only taken twenty steps inside when she stopped cold.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She hunched over her cane and peered into the emptiness ahead. Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see anything. Then came a faint squelching sound that brought to mind Seb\u8217\'92s borcandi chewing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb!\u8221\'94 Moto shouted. His holler drew an angry side-long glance from Elrahet, and if that wasn\u8217\'92t enough to shut him up, a voice rose out of the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed the temple itself was speaking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Welcome, witch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri desperately wanted to flee but somehow couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t. He watched on in astonishment as Moto reached back then threw his torch straight down the hall, towards the voice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The flaming stick went spinning through the air for a good forty yards before it clattered onto the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop at the distant wall, a wall composed of some peculiar material that looked a bit like rough-hewn stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They wish to see my glory,\u8221\'94 said the voice. \u8220\'93Let them see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Two enormous braziers on either wall erupted into flames, illuminating what Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s torch could not, for the distant wall was not a stone wall, it was a colossal mound of flaking skin warted over with bleeding pustules and tags of fat. This swell of flesh was so large that it plugged the room. The whole horrible thing shook as the rasping voice sounded out again, \u8220\'93Behold, my glory!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The mound of flesh rolled forward, and sticking out of its top, like a cork in a wine bag, was the upper body of a skinny old man, white-bearded, shawled in a shimmering green robe. On his head was a crown, and his arms clutched a woman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s headless body. It was Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This putrid king smiled in the fire\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s upshot light, and this smile grew and grew until his jaw dislocated off his skull like a snake\u8217\'92s. He shoved Seb\u8217\'92s lolling neck into his gaping maw, and after he stretched his cheeks beyond reason to accommodate her shoulders, he crunched down onto her spine and began to chew.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A scream of terror died stillborn in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s throat, for arrayed around this bloated beast\u8217\'92s belly were hag-beetles, at least ten of them. Their ruffled black shells glinted in the light of the braziers, and their fishy, lidless eyes shimmered as they studied Mandri and the Ayramun. Mandri briefly wondered if their many legs should be considered arms because of how they ended in human hands instead of feet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri turned to flee, but was stopped by the sight of four demon beetles stuck to the wall above the exit. They clicked their legs against their shells like off-the-wagon addicts.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re doomed,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Moto and Moteah stood in shock, eyes flitting between the great beast and another group of hag-beetles crawling on the ceiling. Only Elrahet showed no fear. She took a step towards Salavan and the beast and bowed deeply, as if petitioning an ordinary outland court. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Greetings, my most repugnant king,\u8221\'94 she said in mocking reverence.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The whole mass of the beast then shivered, for up above, the king\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s distended ribcage squeezed Seb\u8217\'92s body down into his bloated stomach. The sight of his black tongue licking down Seb\u8217\'92s toes was almost more than Mandri could bear, and this was followed by the crack of his jaw snapping back into place.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet watched all this with a scornful glare. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have perverted your flesh, Greskal.\u8221\'94 She heaped ridicule upon the name. But the putrid king, this false god, only laughed. His laugh sent a shudder through his whole bloated body, ending in a horrible burp.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ech! Keep your names to yourself! Poison yourselves with names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. I am more than any name can bear. Look at me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He leaned his whole bulk forward to resettle his great stomach. Mandri suspected that somewhere under the calloused flabs of skin on the floor were legs, but he doubted this demon king could do much more than lean.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am no longer Greskal!\u8221\'94 he thundered. \u8220\'93I have become\u8230\'85I have become, becoming itself! Name me, witch\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 I am Amalgamete!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The echo of his voice filled the hall and stunned all gathered into silence, all save the hag-beetles, who chattered and clicked their chitinous mouths, vibrating with their master\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you think me ugly?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet snarled and spat at the beast.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Amalgamete laughed again at her casual disrespect. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from tar, living tar, for in the dim light it seemed to be wriggling like a piglet. He pulled it further and let it slip, and the flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This ugliness is the world,\u8221\'94 the Amalgamete decreed as he caressed the welling redness. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you see? This pain of flesh is the pain of the world into which a Spark is thrown. The brighter the light of the Spark, the more this ugliness gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would bow before me as your God!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet looked down her nose at this king of demons. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your son had a stronger stomach than you,\u8221\'94 she growled. \u8220\'93Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A paroxysmal twitch shuddered the Amalgamete\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bulk. He pointed to Elrahet and bellowed, \u8220\'93Silence that Spark ensnaring womb!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A hag beetle dropped from the ceiling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It fell with tremendous speed, and as it did, its shell split open, revealing a black, insectoid spike which shot out and jabbed at Elrahet, but the old witch deftly stepped aside and dodged it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetle crashed into the floor, and Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sword lashed out and severed the spike from the beetle\u8217\'92s body.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Amalgamete belched in annoyance as his wounded child scurried away. Then he issued a royal plea to all but Elrahet. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Offer yourselves willingly. Be joined together inside my stomach and know union for once in your miserable lives. And please do not struggle. Stressed meat tastes foul.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 With the natural grace of a man made king from birth, the Amalgamete twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, then waved his minions onward.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Both Moto and Moteah threw down their packs and shielded Elrahet behind them. Mandri held out his sword and assumed responsibility for watching their backs. He turned once more towards the exit. He suddenly regretted not paying more attention to Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fighting lessons, though they might not have helped to prepare against five eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis arrayed above that square doorway. He would have to fight off all of them all at once.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do I do!?\u8221\'94 he screamed at siblings.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just stab the damned things!\u8221\'94 Moteah cried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrugged off his pack and let Obo fall heedlessly to the floor. The beetles fluttered their shells against their backs, preparing to jump. Mandri readied himself to stab. Then the world flashed with the white light of purpose. The God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye sight had blinded him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not now!\u8221\'94 he screamed as his vision plunged into a swirling sea of iridescent light. He ducked low to the ground and swung his sword wildly in the air. He prayed for Solraheen\u8217\'92s protection\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he spoke no words, it was a stronger prayer than that, it was a burst of raw emotion. When the white light bled away it revealed a world in which the hag-beetles had yet to jump. Mandri could see their Sparks floating inside their shells, Sparks of saturated yellow. Shimmering white threads of purpose stretched out of them and wound through the net of fate which fixed the world\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 four beetle threads ran up to the ceiling. One arced through the air straight at Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He would have taken it for his doom, but it stopped right in front of his nose. And there was another shimmering thread of purpose arcing there, one which wound out through the doorway and disappeared into the darkness of the throne room. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The hag-beetle jumped. It sped through the air and its shell parted to let loose its spike, but Mandri did not duck, for he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d caught sight of a giant running through the doorway\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a wild eyed giant with a bread-loaf beard. Mandri sighed in awe as Ayram swung his iron spear right through its guiding thread to break the hag-beetle\u8217\'92s back. An eye-blink later and the beetle smashed into the ground with a tremendous crunch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There stood Ayram. His Spark shone brightly because of course it did, this was Ayram, glorious Ayram, the conquering hero. He even had the Mazidariga child underneath his arm. When he yanked his spear out of the beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly, the beetle spasmed, its Spark dimmed, and its eight legs and many fingers twitched feebly a moment more.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The four other hag-beetles, seeing this, scurried up to the ceiling and fled back down the hall, following their threads of purpose back towards the Amalgamete.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram dumped the dead Mazidariga next to the dead Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get to work,\u8221\'94 he grumbled as he brushed past Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri could not move for he was transfixed by the net of purpose which floated about the room. Thousands of shimmering threads criss-crossed the way towards the Amalgamete, and it seemed that Elrahet was the locus of this creation. Her golden Spark was as bright as the sun, cocooned by threads of purpose. Some of her threads extended out of the room in either direction, and some shot straight up through the ceiling. The sight of it all instilled Mandri with the confidence that they would be victorious, for it was clear to Mandri that her purpose did not end inside this room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But in truth she was outshone by the Amalgamete, whose Spark was a constellation of shimmering spheres of every size and color, and all of them were webbed together inside his bloated stomach. Mandri watched in wonder as these glowing links pulsed, merged, and split apart, while some knots popped like bubbles into sparkling rainbow dust which coalesced into new lines of purpose that stretched out into the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If the Amalgamete were not a god, then he was close to it, for only something divine could build new lines of purpose and set the world into motion. But if he was divine, his flesh was not a suitable vessel. He was lost in the throes of some belly-aching fit. It seemed as if the skinny king on top was about to vomit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A moment!\u8221\'94 the Amalgamete shouted. \u8220\'93We have gifts for all of you, if you\u8217\'92ll only wait a moment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not interested,\u8221\'94 Ayram said as he lofted his spear onto his shoulder and stepped towards the evil gathered across the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The putrid king\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes rolled into white and he punched his body hard enough to knock loose some internal blockage. He moaned and threw his head back as his shoulders cringed and quivered. A cosmic wave rolled under his great bulk and the constellation inside his stomach rolled inside his innards. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder, and the Sparked web was pulled and stretched until a glob or red light snapped loose. When it did, the king above coiled up and screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A boil the size of a wagon wheel burst open. Blackness oozed out of this new cavity, and when the next shudder came this hole ripped wider. Out of this orifice poured a great red lizard demon slathered in tar, Sparked, it seemed, by fire.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Half woman, it stood up on two legs. Half keenkedra, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It wore the muscles of a prize-winning ox, and when it stood up to its full height, it was bigger than Ayram by a head. Its eyes, double lidded, were blood red like its scales, and its pupils reflected the fiery glow of its murderous Spark. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beast licked the air with a forked tongue, and it hissed as it stretched out its limbs for the first time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 its arms were ribbons of muscle, its back a whip, its jaw was full of hateful fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself and delighted in its power.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It slowly turned and set its glowing eyes on Ayram. It let loose a low, purring hiss. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In response, the hag beetles all clicked and scratched their spikes inside their shells before turning their dumb, lidless eyes back towards the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then they began to crawl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazid!\u8221\'94 Ayram shouted. He twirled his spear under his right arm and spat a challenge towards the newborn freak. A snarl of fangs was the reply, and the lizard demon took one step towards its prey.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetles continued to click their excitement while Moto and Moteah herded Mandri and Elrahet into a corner. Mandri dragged Obo and the Riga along by their wrists, though he kept his eyes on the hag-beetles as they scuttled on towards him. The hands at the end of their thin beetle legs slapped the stone like awkward applause. They circled around Ayram and the newborn lizard demon and headed straight for Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s corner. Their numbers on the ceiling swelled. Mandri could just make out the dull shine of eyes as a hag-beetle darted into the darkness directly above him. He could see its yellow Spark clearly, and attached to it was a single thread of inevitable purpose which dropped right down at his feet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They had to hurry. Elrahet had to wake Obo back up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri set the two pale bodies right next to each other, and as he rolled the Riga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder\u8217\'92s flat he noticed that its chest had a spear-sized hole in it. It\u8217\'92s stomach was missing. Obo\u8217\'92s pseudospark was missing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri looked up at Elrahet, who was so shrouded in the white light of purpose that he wondered if she could even see the gaping wound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Beyond her, Ayram roared, and the distance between him and the newborn demon was closed so fast that it seemed only a single leap. The thunder clap of their meeting unleashed chaos in the room. So much happened so fast that Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t keep track.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Down on the floor, three hag-beetles jumped at once\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 maybe it was more, Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure because the rush of bodies, limbs, and twisting threads of fate blurred all motion beyond bewilderment. At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. And before Mandri could raise his sword, Moto pivoted and brought his own blade down on the hag beetle\u8217\'92s back. In a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue behind the beetle\u8217\'92s head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him. Though its head tumbled to the floor, its body wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t fully dead, instead it seized up, and one of its human-handfeet slapped Mandri in the cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri would have laughed if it weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t for the sight of a hag beetle up on the ceiling dropping down\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 things seemed to fall faster when they were falling straight at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle\u8217\'92s neck into Mandri\u8217\'92s face. But this was not enough to obscure his sight of the lines of purpose. One of these white filaments extended out from the attacking beetle\u8217\'92s back and ran a worrisome arc right through the center of Mandri\u8217\'92s forehead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spike flew out of its back, and thanks to the guiding light, Mandri was able to twist his head out of the way.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The spike retracted, then struck out again, and Mandri ducked again, careful to keep his ear out of the bright white arc which mapped the spike\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s path through the future.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri laughed, because he felt like he was cheating, and twice more, the bumbling spike tapped against the stone next to his cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Idiot!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that its lidless saucer eyes were staring right down at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sorry!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri tugged hard on the dead beetle body between them, and as the spike flew down once more it met instead with the dead beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shell. Mandri hid himself beneath this carapace as the beetle above tried to smash through it, and he hid like this until, by the grace of Solraheen, that dumb beetle\u8217\'92s head was severed and fell right in front of his nose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah pulled her sword out of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get up!\u8221\'94 she urged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles, but his hips and thighs were pinned. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kick it off me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah kicked the top beetle and Mandri was able to push himself free from the other. He got to his feet and wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smashed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back across the hall. One of these hags ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the newborn demon, and that beetle was sliced in half by the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s thrashing tail.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his iron spear so fast that it seemed to curve, and it snapped suddenly straight against the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fending tail. Sparks flew, the demon recoiled and raged, then it leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand. Ayram sidestepped, and the demon followed through with its tail to knock Ayram\u8217\'92s spear aside just as the next spinning set of talons were coming round.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below a beheading blow, and leapt away, leaving nothing but a swirl of dust between them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Not only were their movements fraught with impressive power, but their limbs traced through swirling white arcs of purpose. It was a moving image which melted Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind. He resolved then and there to apologize to Moto if they ever made it through this alive, as this fight was indeed a work of wondrous art, as captivating as any other, as revealing, as honest, and it had him rapt in core-collapsing wonder. And when the giants paused their brawl to gather themselves, Mandri saw how badly they\u8217\'92d ravaged each other. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The demon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram\u8217\'92s robe was half-clawed off and ribbons of his flesh hung down his side, exposing the yellow fat, the red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time he exhaled. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The swirl of white light that was Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rump.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Help him!\u8221\'94 she shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag beetles easily enough, but this newborn was an enemy beyond them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go!\u8221\'94 Elrahet screamed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah took off running towards the battle, her purpose clear. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first. He followed, and they got halfway towards Ayram when the demon noticed them. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and crouched down like a cat to retreat back down the hall. Its long tail was raised like that of a scorpion. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet turned to Mandri and drew her golden blade. He could not see her face through the bright white shroud of purpose. Her hand trembled as it lifted the knife up above her head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri panicked. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing?!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch thrust her knife downwards in a swift stroke.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But it was not aimed at Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She brought it down upon her own bright purpose, and the golden blade, curved and gleaming, sliced right through the shimmering threads. The frayed ends splayed out into a tufted cloud, and Elrahet emerged from this mist clad in her usual black robed, leathery self. An eye blink later, and she was completely free of all divine light, save for the light of her Spark. It had only taken one swift cut to unwed herself from the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She smiled at Mandri, a gummy, toothless smile. Mandri was utterly confused as to what this could possibly mean, but there was no time to wonder, for in the distance behind Elrahet he saw the newborn jump all the way to the ceiling. Its arc carried it over the heads of the three warriors, and it hit the ground running straight for Mandri and Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled hiss underneath its permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift strides, and its final leap was tremendous. The sheer size of it could crush them both, but curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The demon rolled under it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram missed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In committing himself to the blow he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d left himself open to the lizard\u8217\'92s scything tail, which did not miss\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it ripped a gash across Ayram\u8217\'92s chest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The lizard demon then crashed into Mandri and Elrahet and sent them sprawling. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri recovered a moment later, he expected to feel the demon hollowing out his head, but the demon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s great arm lay atop him, lifeless. Elrahet\u8217\'92s golden blade was hilted in the top of its skull.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri struggled to push himself out from under the dead demon. Elrahet was lying on the demon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s other side. Mandri\u8217\'92s own sword sticking out of her stomach. A chill of horror crawled through Mandri\u8217\'92s skin as realized he must have accidentally stabbed her in the flurry. He rushed over and tried to help, but could tell from the absence of breath that she was already dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A gargling gasp sounded from behind, and Mandri spun in fright. There was Ayram. Ayram and a river of blood flowing out from the fissure in his chest. Ayram gasped again and he dropped to his knees, then fell backwards. Moto, sprinting up from behind, caught the giant\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fall. Moteah was there too, though she kept on running, and when she caught sight of Elrahet dead by Mandri\u8217\'92s sword, grief and hopelessness broke her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She huddled over Elrahet. Her shaking hands could not believe the blood which wet the witch\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robes. She wiped the blood away with her own robe, then gently brushed Elrahet\u8217\'92s hair with dewy eyed devotion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They come!\u8221\'94 Moto hollered. He lay Ayram down before turning to face the onrushing beetle horde.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let them come,\u8221\'94 Moteah said as she gnashed her teeth and fought back tears. But she thought better of it when her brother shrieked in pain as his leg was sliced by a hag-beetle\u8217\'92s stabbing spine. She picked up her sword again, roared her fighting fury, and then ran to join her brother\u8217\'92s futile act of bravery and defiance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stayed by Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s side. Her golden Spark was still there\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 his sword was stuck right through it. And there was still one thread of purpose sprouting out of it. It was thin, almost invisible, and it was tethered to Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri pulled his sword out of her belly and cast it aside. Then set his lips to her wound, and he sucked her Spark into his mouth. This pure divinity sloshed atop his tongue and the taste of it filled his whole being with ecstasy. The urge to swallow was overwhelming, but that was not what he was meant to do, for a thread of purpose tethered him to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s corpse, and it was shining bright.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hustled over to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lifeless body and squeezed his jaw open. He spit Elrahet\u8217\'92s Spark into the Mazid\u8217\'92s mouth. He drew back, hoping that he was done and that Obo would rise, but the Spark simply puddled in the back of Obo\u8217\'92s throat and did nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri recalled how Elrahet had muttered some guttural speech to bring Obo back after Minting rock. It was something like Old Jandri. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know any Old Jandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know any invocations or incantations which might reweave the threads of purpose, or direct a Spark to his will. The only sacred words he knew were from that pre-meal Solitant prayer, a prayer that wasn\u8217\'92t life affirming, it was life denying. Embedded in it was the thought that life is a terrifying thing. Life kills. Life kills, and it eats what it kills, and for some reason, people fear death. Yes, that is what makes life, life\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it kills and eats, and it kills and it eats. One should not fear death, fear life!}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Consumed by the body}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \tab So that it can}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Feed the Spark}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \tab So that it can}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Move the flesh}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \tab So that it can be}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a mantra which could only be completed when repeated. Mandri spoke it, and he repeated it, and as he whispered it to Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Spark he willed it to move with his feeling. To his delight, a tiny thread of purpose stretched out of that Spark and wandered down Obo\u8217\'92s throat. It wiggled like a worm seeking sustenance. Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t sure whether his ritual refrain or his raw desire drew that thread into being, so he continued on doing both, and he strained with the effort. The harder he focused, and the more he lost himself in the flow of words and emotion, the further the thread traveled on. It went taut when it hit the Mazid\u8217\'92s stomach, and suddenly the shimmering gold Spark zipped down to take up residence in Obo\u8217\'92s belly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whole body pulsed with light, and he awoke with a fresh face, and bright eyes, as if nothing had happened at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He sat up, alert as ever.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hello Mandri. What did I miss?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri simply pointed down the hall, where Moto and Moteah had their backs against the wall, surrounded by a gang of beetles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh,\u8221\'94 said Obo, and as casually as the sun defeats the night, he opened his mouth and shot a golden beam of Mazidfire through the room. He swiped it in a downwards arc, and all at once, a line of twelve  hag-beetles were cut in half.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Amalgamete unleashed a dreadful, squelching scream.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93AIIIEEEEEEEEEGHHhhhhghghh!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He was not at all pleased to see Obo burn his children. And he was not at all pleased to find himself afraid. And upon this afeard and fearsome beast, Obo let loose a powerful bolt of purging fire. The flame merely smashed into the Amalgamete\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s flesh and fizzled, leaving only a scorch mark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beast laughed as if tickled, but Obo resummoned his flame, and this time he held it steady. He held that beam so long that his own throat heated up to incandescence. This roaring flame was a relentless lance, and it popped through one of the Amalgamete\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s great sores. It poured into the demon king\u8217\'92s stomach, heated the insides, boiled them up until sputtering, bubbling blobs of super-heated bile splashed out. Up above, a hiss of steam shot out of the putrid king\u8217\'92s throat, and when Obo finally calmed his fire, the whole beast slumped down, deflated. It appeared to melt into a simmering puddle of its own black bile and blood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Amalgamete was dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 What beetles were still alive went scurrying into the darkness beyond. Obo was content to rub his throat and watch them leave. Meanwhile, Moteah collapsed in exhaustion. Moto shook his head in disbelief at the dead Amalgamete.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then he eyed Obo and snorted. He seemed as displeased to see the Obo moving as he was pleased at the sight of his boot kicking a hag beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head across the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo asked him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why so upset? Would you prefer to have lost?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 have}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  lost!\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Moto shouted. \u8220\'93Ayram is dead! Elrahet is dead!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So? SO!? That witch was the last vestige of Solraheen\u8217\'92s grace on this earth. She battled evil for untold ages, and now she\u8217\'92s gone. She is gone, and her enemy still lives.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are referring to Schisol\u8217\'92s Shadow?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who else?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s question went unanswered, but not because it flustered Obo. Obo was simply unconcerned. But Mandri was very much concerned. He\u8217\'92d played too big a role in all this for it to end badly. Guilt forced him to blurt out, \u8220\'93Why not kill the other witch? Schisol\u8217\'92s Shadow, I mean. We have Obo, we have his Mazidfire. Let\u8217\'92s find her and kill her.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That sounds like a reasonable solution.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t kill her,\u8221\'94 Moto said. His calm delivery belied the fact that his frustration was boiling over. \u8220\'93She wasn\u8217\'92t supposed to die!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then how did Mandri manage it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The tension in Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders snapped, and he stammered out a meek, \u8220\'93I have no idea.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri snickered and gathered himself together. He picked up Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter and carried it over to the Mazid, then patted him on the shoulder. \u8220\'93Let me carry you for another while,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s go find another enemy to burn.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo smiled and climbed into the litter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about you two?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked the siblings. \u8220\'93Are you coming?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Coming where?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sure Shis can\u8217\'92t be far away. There\u8217\'92s got to be a demon hole in the ground around here somewhere. Come on, what else are you going to do? This is what you\u8217\'92re here for, right? Ending evil? Well, let\u8217\'92s end it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Before Mandri left the room, he yanked Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s golden knife from out of the lizard demon\u8217\'92s head. With this, he hoped to shape the future.}}
