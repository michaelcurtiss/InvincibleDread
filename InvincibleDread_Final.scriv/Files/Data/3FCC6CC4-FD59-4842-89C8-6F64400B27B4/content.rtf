\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s nothing complicated about terror. Mandri was all too familiar with its tired routine\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 first it startled him into stupidity, and then it spurred him into action, or petrified him, according to the flavor of the moment. He always knew it was coming on, and he knew what it would do, and he knew there was no fighting it. When Elrahet suggested, in her witchy way, that his moment of passage was near, he became terrified. He ran past that golden statue of Solraheen and made sure to rub kiss its hand, but that didn\u8217\'92t help at all. Terror trembled his knees as he ran through the accursed temple\u8217\'92s bowels, bumping his nose and toes on stone shelves and cabinet footings because he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed, according to Moto, because there wasn\u8217\'92t any time to light one up, even though it only took a fifth of a god-damned finger. As it goes with terror\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 reason is not allowed a say. If it was, he might have been able to sort through how he felt about his companions.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He hated these Ayramun for leading him here.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He loved these Ayramun for protecting him from the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He hated them and loved them in equal turns.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto led them into a dark dead end, and Mandri hated him. Moto led them into a windowed hall flush with fresh night air, and Mandri loved him. Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated her. Mandri slipped on spot of Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated her\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Seb was the sole exception to this confusing succession of states in which blurred together and hinted at a deeper reality which Mandri could not articulate. Love and hate, it seemed, were only crude approximations\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was as if there was a color portrait to be painted here, but all Mandri had were pigments black and white.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It reminded him, and this was not the time for it, but it reminded him of Solraheen, for His love was both comforting and terrifying. Yes, Mandri feared a loving Divine. That was the habit of terror, it teased the ambivalence out of him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He hated Elrahet for her witchy mumblings as she scampered along in the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This isn\u8217\'92t right,\u8221\'94 she hissed through clenched teeth. \u8220\'93Isn\u8217\'92t right, isn\u8217\'92t right, isn\u8217\'92t right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He loved her because she seemed to be the only one who knew what was going on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This way!\u8221\'94 she barked when Moto ran past a doorway.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah yanked Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put your sword away you idiot!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even know he had it out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re going to stab me,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put it }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 away}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 .  Damn it Moto, why\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d you give him a sword?!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade. Good thing he did, because not long after, Elrahet took a sharp turn into another dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are we doing?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked with venom. Moto, the prime object of her ire, had lost his poise the moment everyone else stopped listening to him. \u8220\'93We }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 wait}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 here}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  for Ayram!\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 he blustered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t act like you meant to run in here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was following Elrahet!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb sucked a hiss between her teeth. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So we jus\u8217\'92 bumblin\u8217\'92 around?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They all looked to Elrahet, and she mumbled back, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My foot is sore, I need off it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto moaned and smacked the wall with an open hand. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is why I should be in charge. Ayram put me in charge, and I say we pause to take a little time to }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 think}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 . Because I don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t think there\u8217\'92s even an Amalgamete in here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no one to eat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri retreated into a dark corner of this small room as the others got into an argument about the Amalgamete\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dietary cycle. Were these demon lords always moving, always preying on stomachs? Did they need to rest after consuming a tribe three-thousand strong?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri wished this temple wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have been so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. It wasn\u8217\'92t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps because there weren\u8217\'92t any light fittings bolted to the walls. Whoever built this place }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 wanted}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  it to be dark. The flat ceiling was completely free from the soot of ages, and this room had no hope of natural light\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Shulgi was much too thick in the belly for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help the unrighteous lose themselves, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around the blocky walls of this apparent dead end, and they were stacked upon the each other from floor to the ceiling. The walls all throughout the place were carved up like this, and most were painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with lines and lines of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears, there were garden scenes where Old Jandri kings strolled along in quiet contemplation, there were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dark brother, Schisol, burning martyrs who screamed as tongues of flame licked their ribs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that was being told. It reminded him of Hrkan tomb art\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 some rich lick decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when the tomb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s door is sealed no one is allowed to have a look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and now no one is looking. A monumental waste of good pigment.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No places for candles in a tomb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No room for natural light either.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is this a tomb?\u8221\'94 he whispered over his shoulder to Obo. He was surprised to find that Obo had turned around his litter and was peering around Mandri\u8217\'92s neck at the art.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If it were a tomb, there\u8217\'92d be writing. To be honest, I\u8217\'92m having trouble reading the narrative.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Same.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even sure if he were reading the panels in the right direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight. It was hard to see, because not only was the light too dim, but it blinked every time Moto waved his frantic arms to try and express his argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the moment of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s birth, when He emerged out of void. It was represented here by a blank face emerging from a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark ripping out the stone. Each claw was as wide as two of his own fingers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh, guys.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The others were too engrossed in their squabble to hear him, as Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri raised his voice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They all stopped bickering and stared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at this.\u8221\'94 Mandri pointed at the beastly gash in Solraheen\u8217\'92s forehead. Seb stepped over and studied the defacement with a critical eye. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s just scratches.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see,\u8221\'94 Elrahet grumbled as she waved Mandri and Seb aside with her torch. She stood on her tiptoes and stretched her leather neck to sniff it. When she balanced back down on her heels her wrinkled face was gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is as I feared,\u8221\'94 she said bitterly, and she eyed those gathered with contempt. \u8220\'93No more mewling.\u8221\'94 She then pushed past Moto and trotted off into the darkness of the hallway, black robes fluttering, expecting everyone else to follow. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about Ayram?\u8221\'94 Moto whined as he took off after her. Moteah and Seb quickly followed, leaving Mandri and Obo alone in the pitch black room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Will we not be joining them?\u8221\'94 Obo asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri whispered back, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hold on,\u8221\'94 and he fished around in his robe\u8217\'92s pocket for his burgeon. He wasn\u8217\'92t about to go running through a demon-infested temple with out some way seeing a demon before it jumps. Thinking the God\u8217\'92s Eye sight would reveal their Sparks, he unstopped his burgeon\u8217\'92s tiny thorn-plug, and he shook a drop of juice onto his outstretched tongue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His journey through the dark began anew. Elrahet led the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the scratches in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because where else would an Amalgamete dwell but deep? They ventured so far down into this temple mountain that it seemed to Mandri this building was upside down. A temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens. There should be an ascension to the roof where the penitent could await the coming dawn. But he went down, and the further down he went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet led them all down a wide fan of stairs whose ceiling and walls bowed out into a black void. They had stumbled into a monumental underground expanse, a throne room fit for a god. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts closed in on them. Suffice to say, Mandri no longer felt like he was \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91inside\u8217\'92, and despite his supreme misgivings they continued on. Mandri felt smaller and the terror was growing, and he huddled close to the Ayramun in their dinghy of torchlight set adrift this a sea of darkness. If not for the hard stone under Mandri\u8217\'92s feet and the fractal cubic pattern etched onto it, he might have lost his wits completely.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That pattern was mesmerizing, hairs of black squares lining larger squares, and as he walked this pattern gave way to a processional of obsidian-studded squares. This processional was straddled on either side by enormous stone columns shaped as legs, legs whose bodies disappeared into the interminable blackness above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet picked up speed and purpose, and she led them past these columns while Mandri prayed for the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye sight to come to him that he might see whatever winged demons hid in the shadows of the god-sized uglies above. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 At pace, they reached the end of the hall. This end was a flat gray granite wall etched with carvings that matched the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s exterior\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 faces inside of faces, howling animal, untamed men, snarling demons, and all these faces radiated out of a central circle which ringed a sandstone throne, stone as red as a rose, a throne uplifted by of a narrow set of stairs. This throne\u8217\'92s seat and arms were smooth and featureless, fashioned from river-bloated stone, while its back was a billowing slab carved to look like flame licked into a curl by an unseen of wind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The throne\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s seat was as empty as the rest of the temple, which is to say it was filled with malevolent purpose. Mandri felt an unease come over him at the sight of it. He felt outnumbered against the great emptiness around him. That\u8217\'92s when noticed that Seb was missing. And the moment he noticed it, Moteah noticed it. The whites of her eyes bulged as she counted and counted again\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only four were present, only four, and she counted again despite the obviousness of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s\u8230\'85where\u8217\'92s Seb?!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The question choked her throat as she held her own torch out towards the void, hoping to catch sight of Seb lagging just behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet and Moto spun around, and upon seeing their number diminished by one, Moto drew his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb!?\u8221\'94 he shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch smacked his thigh with her cane.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quiet!\u8221\'94 she shushed. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ll wake Schisol Himself from the dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto set his disturbed temper upon Mandri.  suspicion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is she!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have no idea,\u8221\'94 Mandri, fear trembling his voice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you do anything to her? Let me see your sword,\u8221\'94 Moto demanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri fumbled at his sword\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hilt, and as he pulled it out he dropped it. The hilt and blade clanged on stone floor, and this cavernous hall it magnified into peal of thunder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto clenched his jaw and shuddered. He after making sure Mandri his great displeasure, he lowered his torch over the blade and studied the sheen of light, looking for signs of use, but it was clean.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wait,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, \u8220\'93You think I }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 killed}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Seb in the dark?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you? Did either of you do anything that\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo climbed up in his litter to peer over Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder. He interrupted Moto\u8217\'92s frenzied mood by stating, calmly, \u8220\'93We didn\u8217\'92t do anything to the woman. I fact, I watched her scamper away from the group as soon as we entered the hall.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I watched her\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why didn\u8217\'92t you say anything?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am not the woman\u8217\'92s Minder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where did she go?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That way,\u8221\'94 Obo said as he pointed to a perfectly square doorway which opened the wall to the right of the throne\u8217\'92s stairs. Moto moved towards it, but he stopped when Obo called out after him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wouldn\u8217\'92t run so quick if I were you,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a foul smell coming from that hall.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet paid this warning no mind as she brushed past Moto and took the lead again. She rushed through that square doorway. Mandri picked up his sword, and followed everyone else in chasing after the witch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The doorway lead to another large hall, though it was much smaller than the throne room, for while the its length disappeared into darkness the ceiling and walls were brushed by the light of their torches.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t gotten twenty steps inside when she stopped cold.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She hunched over her cane and peered into the emptiness ahead. Mandri watched her aged face for some sign of fear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her eye twitched at the sound of a faint squelching that brought to mind Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s borcandi chewing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb!\u8221\'94 Moto shouted out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His holler drew an angry side-long glance from Elrahet, and if that wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t enough to shut him up, a voice rose out of the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was not Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. It was a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed Shulgi itself was speaking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Welcome, witch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 By Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s estimation, an unaccounted-for voice weighs heavy on the scale of terror. It weighs heavier still if it comes spewing out a dark abyss, and heavier still if it comes wheezing out like the whine of a dying man. This terror weighed twice as much as he did\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he could not move despite wanting desperately to flee. He watched in astonishment as Moto reached back with his torch and threw it straight down the hall, towards the voice. The flaming stick went spinning through the air, and it flew at least forty yards before it clattered onto the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop at the distant wall, a wall composed of some peculiar material that looked a bit like rough-hewn stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Salavan,\u8221\'94 said the voice, \u8220\'93They wish to see my glory. Let them see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Two enormous braziers on either wall erupted into flame, illuminating what Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s torch did not, for the distant wall was not a stone wall, it was a colossal mound of flaking skin warted over with bleeding pustules and tags of fat, and this swell of flesh was so large that it plugged the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The whole horrible thing shook as as the rasping voice sounded out again, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Behold my glory, witch!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The mound of flesh rolled forward, and sticking out of it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s top, like a cork in a winebag, was the upper body of a skinny old man, white-bearded, shawled in a shimmering green robe. On his head was a crown, and his arms clutched a woman\u8217\'92s lifeless body.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The demon king smiled in the fire\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s upshot light, and this smile grew and grew until his jaw dislocated off his skull like a snake\u8217\'92s. He shoved Seb\u8217\'92s lolling head into his gaping maw, and after he stretched his cheeks beyond reason to accommodate her shoulders, he crunched down onto her spine and began to chew.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A scream of terror died stillborn in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s throat, for arrayed around this bloated beast\u8217\'92s belly were demon roaches the size of dogs, at least ten of them, with oily-black shells and human hands sprouting out the ends of their segmented legs. Their faces were an unholy mix between a insect\u8217\'92s and a man\u8217\'92s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling, their mouths gulping air like fish out of water.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Standing amongst  them was a man, a white-robed man, large but dwarfed by a single fold of the bloated king\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s skin. It was none other than Salavan, the Governor of Meskalim, the man who\u8217\'92d killed Mandri all those moons ago. His white beard broke into a satisfied grin at the sight of Mandri, and he set his hand on the shoulder of a child at his side.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A pale child wrapped in black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A Mazidariga.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The sight of the Riga spurred Mandri into motion. He turned to flee, but was stopped by the sight of four demon beetles stuck to the wall above the exit. They clicked their legs against their shells like jittering addicts.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Before Mandri could even think about being brave, the Mazidariga whistled it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tinny song. It started like and any other whistle, a startling trill, but it soon pitched into a mind splitting squeal which dropped Mandri to his knees. He cowered against it, and prayed a broken prayer between gasps as Obo convulsed inside his litter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But the whistling did not last long, and as soon as it stopped, Mandri shrugged himself out of the litter\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s straps and turned around to discover that Obo had gone limp.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Mazidariga had sucked Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pseudospark clean from his body.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Their entire plan to kill the Amalgamete revolved around Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fire, and now Obo was effectively dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re doomed,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No one heard him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto and Moteah had their swords drawn, and they backed towards Mandri slowly, their eyes set on the darkness of the ceiling above, where two demon beetles were lurking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are these things?!\u8221\'94 Moto cried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hag beetles,\u8221\'94 Elrahet answered, unafraid. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92ve spines that shoot from inside their shells\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 careful when they open.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rumbling laugh boomed out at Elrahet\u8217\'92s assertion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hag beetles?\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93They are not hag beetles. They have no names. Keep your names to yourself, witch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet took a step towards Salavan and bowed, as if petitioning an ordinary outland court. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Steward of the most putrid king,\u8221\'94 she said in mocking reverence, \u8220\'93None are worthy of a names, and yet Solraheen provides us all with names.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The putrid king\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes rolled back as he continued to swallow Seb whole, meanwhile Salavan was worked into a rage. \u8220\'93A name? A name!?\u8221\'94 he yelled, \u8220\'93Poison yourselves with your names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. My Lord and his are more than any name can bear. Look at him!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Salavan spread his arms, the width was a tiny measure against his lord\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s monstrous girth. The whole mass of the beast then shivered, for up above, the king\u8217\'92s distended ribcage squeezed Seb\u8217\'92s body down into his bloated stomach. The sight of his black tongue licking down Seb\u8217\'92s toes was almost more than Mandri could bear, yet the crack of his jaw snapping back into place was somehow more disturbing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet watched all this with a scornful glare.  She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have perverted your flesh, Greskal,\u8221\'94 heaping ridicule upon his name.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But the putrid king Greskal only laughed, and his laugh sent a shudder through his whole bloated body, ending in a horrible burp.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ugh-urp-huh-huhhh\u8230\'85 Greskal?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He leaned his whole bulk forwards to resettle his great stomach. Mandri suspected that somewhere under the calloused flabs of skin on the floor were legs, but he doubted this demon king could do much more than lean.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am not Greskal\u8230\'85No longer Greskal\u8230\'85I have become\u8230\'85I have become, becoming itself! Name me, witch\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 I am Amalgamete!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The echo of his voice filled the hall and stunned all gathered into silence, all save the hag beetles, who chattered and clicked their teeth, vibrating with their master\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you think me ugly?\u8221\'94 the Amalgamete said. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have split and ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from tar, living tar, and in the dim light it seemed that the lump of flesh in his grip was wriggling like a piglet. He pulled it further and let it slip, and the flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This flesh is the world,\u8221\'94 the Amalgamete decreed as he caressed the welling redness. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you see? This pain of flesh is the pain of the world into which a Spark thrown. The whiter the light of the Spark, the more this filth gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would supplicate yourselves before me as your god!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet looked down her nose at this self-proclaimed god. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your son had a stronger stomach than you,\u8221\'94 she growled. \u8220\'93Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A paroxysmal twitch shuddered through the Amalgamete\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body. He pointed to Elrahet and bellowed, \u8220\'93Silence that Spark ensnaring womb!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A black spike shot out of the nearest hag beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body. The spike flew at Elrahet as quickly as a rock loosed from a sling, but Moto\u8217\'92s sword lashed out with blinding speed and sent the spike bouncing harmlessly aside. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Amalgamete belched in annoyance. Then he said, with a disapproving frown, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should offer yourselves willingly. Be joined together inside my stomach and know union for once in your miserable lives. And besides, stressed meat tastes fouler.\u8221\'94 He grimaced, and black drool dripped from his bottom lip. And with the natural grace of a man made king from birth, he twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, and waved his minions onward.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Both Moto and Moteah threw down their packs, and they gathered Elrahet behind their swords. Mandri held his own sword out before him, though he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know what to do with it. He assumed the responsibility for watching their backs. His arm trembled, it trembled out of fear, not the weight, and he suddenly regretted not paying Moto\u8217\'92s fighting lesson any mind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But even if he had paid attention to Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lesson, it wouldn\u8217\'92t have prepared him to deal with an eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis. And there were four of them arrayed above the exit. And he had to fight off all of them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do I do!?\u8221\'94 he screamed at siblings.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just stab the damned things!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri readied himself to stab, and the next thought that went through his mind was that things seem to move faster when they were moving right at him, for one of those beetles had jumped right at him, and as it sped through the air its shell parted open and a blur shot out of it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrieked, swung out with his sword, but it swung unbothered for his vision flashed with the white light of purpose and blinded him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not now!\u8221\'94 he screamed as the God\u8217\'92s Eye sight plunged his vision into a swirling sea of iridescent light. He cursed his unluck that the burgeon should strike him in this crucial moment. He ducked to dodge the leaping beetle, he ducked low to the ground, and he prayed for Solraheen to protect him\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no words, just a shrieking plea of raw emotion sent through the aether where only divine ears could hear, and though his plea was honest, he still expected to feel a spike pierce through his neck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When that didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t happen, he opened his eyes and praised the wonder of being alive.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Even more astonishing was the demon beetle twitching at his feet. It lay belly-up, and it had been crushed. The God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye sight revealed the beetle\u8217\'92s bright yellow Spark lying inside its juddering stomach. Stretching out of that Spark was a single thread of bright white purpose, and that shimmering thread drew up into an arc high above, where it was tied to the chisel-tip head of Ayram\u8217\'92s iron spear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri sighed in awe at the giant\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s miraculous presence. He flinched in fright as Ayram rammed his spear head down onto the beetle\u8217\'92s belly with incredible ferocity, impaling the beetle right the way through. The beetle spasmed, its Spark dimmed, and its legs twitched feebly for a moment more. The three other beetles, seeing this, scurried up to the ceiling and fled back down the hall, towards the Amalgamete.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thank god.\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered as he basked in Ayram\u8217\'92s radiance, for the giant\u8217\'92s Spark shone brightly, and a thread of purpose connected it to Mandri\u8217\'92s own Spark\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this was the first comfort he had found in this accursed temple.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But his thread was not the only one. There was a web of purpose, connecting both Ayram and Mandri to the beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s scurrying overhead, connecting Moteah, who rushed over to her leader and asked, \u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s wrong?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a silly question. Everything was wrong. The world was wrong. Ayram was the only thing right with it. But then Mandri noticed that Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left arm was tucked into his robe, and the giant winced as he rolled that shoulder to test it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Got stabbed by a Skulsi,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Arm\u8217\'92s useless.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He then he caught sight of Obo who lay limp on the floor next to Mandri. He looked for answer and found it in the Mazidariga child hugging Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s leg. He put this little puzzle together, and as he did his stern confidence cracked. His people were reduced to three, and he saw no hope in any of them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But he did not have the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He could not see what Mandri saw\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he might as well have been blind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Spark was as bright as the sun, and she was swarmed by threads of purpose which clouded her figure in light. Some of these threads extended out of the room in either direction, and some shot straight up through the ceiling. It was clear to Mandri that at least her purpose did not end inside this room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But neither was her victory certain, for she was outshone by the Amalgamete, whose Spark was a constellation of shimmering spheres of light, every size and color, and all of them were webbed together inside his bloated stomach. Mandri watched in wonder as these glowing links pulsed, merged, and split apart, while some knots popped like bubbles into sparkling rainbow dust which coalesced into new lines of purpose that stretched out into the world. All the while, the skinny king plopped atop this splendor was lost in the throes of some belly-aching fit. It seemed as if he were about to vomit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Salavan seemed oblivious to his foul master\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pains. He smiled at the sight of Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Welcome!\u8221\'94 he shouted as if greeting a long lost friend. \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ve been expecting a big man such as you. Gifts for all of you, if you\u8217\'92ll only wait a moment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not interested,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled as he lofted his spear onto his good shoulder and stepped towards the evils across the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, come,\u8221\'94 said Salavan, beckoning. \u8220\'93But I won\u8217\'92t have that rudeness. Give the good lord a moment and he\u8217\'92ll give back a blessed eternity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The putrid king rolled his eyes into white and he punched his body hard enough to knock loose some internal blockage. Then he moaned and threw his whole head back as his shoulders cringed and quivered. A cosmic wave rolled under his great bulk like the ocean rolling under a mat of weeds, and the constellation inside his stomach was propelled through his innards. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder, and at last a glob of fiery red light snapped loose from the web, and as it did, the king above coiled up and screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered. A boil the size of a wagon wheel burst open near in that great belly. Blackness oozed out of this new cavity, and when the next shudder roiled the Amalgamete, this cavity ripped wider, and out of it poured a great red lizard demon slathered in tar, Sparked, it seemed, by fire.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Half woman, it stood up on two legs. Half keenkedra, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It was bigger than Ayram by a head, and it wore the muscles of a prize-winning ox. Its eyes, double lidded, were blood red like its scales, and its pupils reflected the glow of its angry Spark. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beast licked the air with a forked tongue, and it hissed as it stretched out its limbs for the first time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 its arms were ribbons of muscle, its back a whip, its jaw was full of hateful fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself and delighted in the power.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then it set its glowing eyes on Ayram and it let loose a low, purring hiss. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In response, the hag beetles all around clicked and scratched their spikes against the insides their shells before turning their dumb, lidless eyes back towards the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then they began to crawl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get out!\u8221\'94 Ayram shouted. \u8220\'93Flee!\u8221\'94 He twirled his spear under his good right arm and spat a challenge towards the reptile freak. A snarl of fangs was the reply, and the lizard demon took one step towards its prey.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetles, still clicking their excitement, scurried wide around both giants, while Moto and Moteah herded Mandri and Elrahet into a corner. The hag beetles closed ranks behind Ayram, though they weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t at all interested in him. They kept on creeping along the hall, while their numbers on the ceiling swelled. Mandri could just make out the dull shine of eyes as one darted into the darkness directly above him. He couldn\u8217\'92t see it, but he knew it was there, for he could see its yellow Spark, and attached to it was a single taut thread of purpose which was stuck to his own poor stomach.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He tried to cut this thread with his sword, but the blade wafted right through it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then he heard Ayram roar, and the distance between the two giants was closed so fast that it seemed only a single step. The thunder clap of their meeting unleashed chaos in the room. So much happened so fast that Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t keep track.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Down on the floor, three beetles jumped at once\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 maybe it was more, Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure because the blur of bodies, limbs, and twisting threads of fate was bewildering. At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. Before Mandri could raise his sword, Moto brought his own blade down on the hag beetle\u8217\'92s back, and in a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue right behind the beetle\u8217\'92s head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him, and though it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head tumbled to the floor its body wasn\u8217\'92t fully dead\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it seized up, and one of its human-handfeet slapped Mandri in the cheek. Mandri would have laughed if it weren\u8217\'92t for the sight of that hag beetle up on the ceiling dropping down. Things fall faster when they were falling at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle\u8217\'92s neck and right into Mandri\u8217\'92s face. But this was not enough to obscure his sight of the lines of purpose, and one of these divine white filaments extended out from the attacking beetle\u8217\'92s back and ran right through the center of his forehead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spike flew out of its back, but Mandri was able to duck out of the way. It retreacted and struck out again, and Mandri ducked again, careful to keep his ear out of the bright white arc which mapped the spike\u8217\'92s path through the future. Mandri laughed, because he felt like he was cheating, and twice more, the bumbling spike tapped against the stone next to his cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Dumb idiot!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lidless saucer eyes were staring down right at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri tugged hard on the dead body between them, and as the spike flew down at his face it met instead with the dead beetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shell. Mandri hid himself underneath this carapace as the beetle tried to smash through it, and he hid like this until, by the grace of Solraheen, that dumb beetle\u8217\'92s severed head fell right in front of his nose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah pulled her sword out of it. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get up!\u8221\'94 she urged, and Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles, but his hips and thighs were pinned. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kick it off me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah kicked the top beetle off him. Mandri was able to push himself free from the other, and he got to his feet. He wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smushed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back across the hall. One of these ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the newborn lizard demon, and that beetle was sliced in half by the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s thrashing tail.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his iron spear so fast that it seemed to curve, and it snapped suddenly straight against the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fending tail. Sparks flew, the demon recoiled and raged, then it leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand, and it followed through with its tail which knocked Ayram\u8217\'92s spear aside as the next set of talons were coming round. Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below a beheading blow, and he leapt away, leaving nothing but a swirl of dust between them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stared in awe at their struggle, for not only were their movements fraught with power, their limbs traced through swirling white lines of purpose to compose a moving image which melted Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind. He resolved then and there to apologize to Moto if they ever made it through this alive, as this fight was indeed a work of wondrous art, as captivating as any other. Then the giants paused their brawl to gather themselves, and Mandri saw how badly they\u8217\'92d ravaged each other. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The demon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram\u8217\'92s robe was half-clawed off and ribbons of his flesh hung down his side, exposing the yellow fat, the red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time he exhaled.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The swirl of white light that was Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rump.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Help him!\u8221\'94 she shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag beetles easily enough, but this newborn was an enemy beyond them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go!\u8221\'94 Elrahet screamed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah took off running towards the battle, her purpose clear. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first. He followed her, and they got halfway towards Ayram when the demon noticed their coming. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and it crouched down like a cat to retreat back down the hall with its long tail raised like a scorpion. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet turned to Mandri and drew her golden blade. He could not see her face through the bright white shroud of purpose. All he could see was her hand raise that knife high in the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing?!\u8221\'94 Mandri freaked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One stroke was all it took to unwed her from the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s all up to you,\u8221\'94 she said, leaving Mandri confused as to what she could possibly have in mind. Then he saw, over her shoulder, that the great demon had jumped all the way up to the ceiling and bounded off it, leaping over the heads of the three warriors. It hit the ground running straight for Mandri and Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled hiss underneath its permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift bounds. This killer was enormous, strong and sleek, and aside from its flapping jaw it was perfectly symmetrical. No ugly ears, and its scaly skin glistened in the sheen of its blood and afterbirth. Its final leap was tremendous. The sheer size of it could crush them both, but curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spear. The demon rolled under it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram had missed, and in committing himself to the blow he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d left himself open to the lizard\u8217\'92s scything tail, which did not miss\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it ripped a gash right across Ayram\u8217\'92s chest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The lizard crashed into Mandri and Elrahet and sent them sprawling. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri recovered, he expected to see the demon hollowing out his head, but its great arm lay atop him, lifeless. It was almost like waking up to a lover\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a foul smelling, fang-toothed, flesh feeding lover. Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s golden blade was hilted in the top of its skull.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri pushed himself out from under the dead creature, and he looked for the old witch that he might help her, and thank her, but he found her lying on her side with his own sword sticking into her stomach. A chill of horror crawled through his skin as realized that he must have accidentally stabbed her in the flurry. He rushed over and tried to help, but he knew in his heart that she was already dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A gargling gasp sounded out from behind, and Mandri spun in fright. There was only Ayram, Ayram and a river of blood flowing out from the fissure in his chest. He gasped again and he dropped to his knees, then fell backwards. Moto, sprinting up from behind, caught his fall. Moteah was there too, though she kept on running, and when she caught sight of Elrahet dead by Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s blade, she screamed\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no word, just a primal scream, a shriek of grief and hopelessness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She huddled over Elrahet. Her shaking hands could not believe the blood which welled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They come!\u8221\'94 Moto hollered, and he lay Ayram down and turned to face the onrushing beetle horde. Moteah roared a ___, and she ran to join her brother in a final, futile act of bravery and ___.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He kneeled. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His blade had opened her stomach, and there inside was her Spark, gleaming softly, but not gone. And compared to all other Sparks he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen, hers was different - Mandri\u8217\'92s own Spark shimmered into color, but hers shimmered into gold. And there was still on thread of purpose stringing it together, and this thin, almost invisible line was tethered to Mandri\u8217\'92s mouth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He realized what he must do\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he set his lips to the wound and sucked her Spark into his mouth. It sloshed atop his tongue and the taste of it filled his whole being with ecstasy, for it imparted a flavor he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d not tasted since his burgeon binge through Meskalim. The urge to swallow was overwhelming, but that was not what he was meant to do for a thread of purpose tethered him to Obo\u8217\'92s corpse, and it was shining bright.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hustled over to Obo and squeezed the Mazid\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw open. Then he spit Elrahet\u8217\'92s Spark into the Obo\u8217\'92s mouth. He drew back and watch the Spark in the back of Obo\u8217\'92s throat and do nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He remembered how Elrahet had muttered some gutteral speech to bring Obo back after Minting rock. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know Old Jandri. He didn\u8217\'92t know any invocations or incantations which might reweave the threads of purpose or direct a Spark to his will. The only sacred words he knew was from a Solitant in which he was fed a living fish. It was about how Death is a terrifying thing, but Life is more so. Life kills. Life kills, and it eats what it kills, and for some reason, people fear death. Living things kill and eat each other, and that is what makes life, life. As the Solitants will say, do not fear death, fear life! And the mantra they spoke to hammer this home was .}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a mantra which could only be completed when repeated, and this Mandri did as he willed the Spark to take up residence inside of Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach. He wished, willed, and commanded that Spark to move, and eventually a thread of purpose began to stretch out of it to wander down Obo\u8217\'92s throat. This bright thread wiggled like a worm seeking sustenance. Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t sure whether it was his ritual refrain, or his raw desiring which drew this thread into being, so he continued on doing both and he strained hard from the effort. The harder he focused, the more he lost himself in the flow of words and emotion, and so the further the thread traveled. When it hit the Mazid\u8217\'92s stomach, it went taught and a half-breath later, the shimmering gold Spark zipped down to rest in Obo\u8217\'92s belly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Obo awoke with a fresh face, and he was bright eyed, as if nothing had happened at all.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The room erupted in a horrible squelching scream.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo shuffled on his stumps towards it, and he let loose a purging flame aimed right at the bulging middle of the beast. The flame shot out, and it smashed into the flesh as a spout of water smashes against stone. But Obo persisted, his own flame heating his throat to incandescence, and he kept at it until the flame popped through the demons. }
