\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One religion is True and the rest are False.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Unfortunately for missionaries the world over, this simple dichotomy does not satisfy everyone. Some believe that no religion is in complete possession of the divine truth. More analytical minds move beyond blanket dismissals and simple dichotomies to organize an understanding of the world\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s religions. Their program is systematic investigation into the similarities and differences of belief and behavior. Solitants come specially prepared for battle in this arena.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When a Solitiant proselytizes to the fractured, they open with the observation that every religion in existence turns on a story that explains the origin of suffering. The Supine Cult believes that there are two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mood swings. The Bavainu believe that suffering is a result of one\u8217\'92s own evil acts, or one\u8217\'92s ancestors. The Shell Kings believe that suffering is a symptom of Shellkhashar, a sort of primordial ooze which can inflict a spiritual, transmittable disease which dulls virtuous instinct. There are a hundred more religions, each with a hundred variations, and in every instance, the story of suffering\u8217\'92s arrival is accompanied by a solution for it. The Supine Cult entreats their followers to lay down and pray their energy into the sky to make it stronger, for that is where the righteous god dwells. The Bavainu say that if one lives rightly and follows their ancient law, their life will be a happy one. The Shell Kings recommend drinking the blood of a willing virgin mixed with a mind melting toxin found in a sea snail\u8217\'92s shell. Every religion has its own solution to suffering. That\u8217\'92s a category\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 religions peddling relief, and all religions belong to it. All of them except for the one\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the one that Solitants preach. They offer no solution to life\u8217\'92s troubles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 "We\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re the only ones who believe that suffering is nothing to fear," a Solitant priest will say. "Suffering is what this is all about!"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He or she then smiles, and the smile accentuates the self-inflicted scar on their cheek which marks the rite of initiation into Solitant orders. Those Solitants who have delved deep into the mysteries smile underneath a mask of scars.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 "Life }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  suffering", they say. "Try to suffer without suffering." They laugh because it doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t make sense. Truly, the Divine Spark is like a block of sculptor's stone. It is clean, abstract, inert, featureless\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and then comes the sculptor's chisel. As the chisel carves away at the stone to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the person. What troubles our fleshy vessels is what makes us who we are. In this way, Solitants are artists of the Self and their chisel is pain. Solraheen guides the hammer.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Common Hrkan speech has only the one word for pain. If a person says, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am in pain,\u8221\'94 there\u8217\'92s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe, or did a loved one die? Have their bowels been blocked for days? The word \u8216\'91pain\u8217\'92 can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are sharing the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The words \u8216\'91anguish\u8217\'92, \u8216\'91ache\u8217\'92, \u8216\'91soreness\u8217\'92, \u8216\'91irritation\u8217\'92, and \u8216\'91misery\u8217\'92 all approach different things, but they\u8217\'92re not nearly enough to cover the spectrum. But they\u8217\'92re ill-defined notions anyways, they\u8217\'92re substitutable, a fuzzy cloud orbiting that simple word, pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Solitant goes as far as to claim that the very structure of Hrkan speech stunts the growth of pain appreciation, as the mind cannot develop a sensitivity to certain flavors of agony if the world is divided into subject, verb, and object. Such a structure separates the Self from the action, and in so doing, grand vistas of becoming remain hidden from sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The keyturn comes after reflecting on the sentence, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91I hurt myself.\u8217\'92}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 I}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Hurt}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Myself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Notice how language has smuggled in a narrative. It has conjured out of nothing an \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91I\u8217\'92 from before and a \u8216\'91myself\u8217\'92 after the act of hurt. It has split the Self in two, which is impossible, and it has reduced \u8216\'91hurt\u8217\'92 to a phase transition instead of an intrinsic part of the proper Self. Solitants find this framing limiting, and so they invented a tenseless, subjectless language revolving around pain and its effects. Outside looking in, this language is more of a catalog of rasping utterances than a functional language, but Solitants claim it has utility nonetheless.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was perfectly fine with the phrase \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91I hurt myself\u8217\'92. Hurting himself was the primary means he\u8217\'92d ever acquired hurt. His troubles often began with his own decisions, even if others were involved. He suspected that it was much the same for everyone else. There was no need to deconstruct something so universal. There definitely wasn\u8217\'92t any point in creating a whole new language to discover the \u8216\'91subtleties of pain\u8217\'92, because pain was best expressed through the natural language of gesture, as Solraheen intended. In breadth of expression, the face is far, far superior to words. Of what use is a fuzzy word when one can see pain written on the face clear as day?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Observe the eye and brow of a person in pain\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 is there languor, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience, anxiety? Is the skin knit tight, is it smooth, is it beaded with sweat? Is the eye\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lid puffy or hollow? Are the cheeks wet or dry, dark or pale, sallowing brown, or purple, or yellow? Then there\u8217\'92s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up into the face. The lower back knots up, the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, and finally the lips draw tight and the teeth gnash. A trained eye can look at another in pain and know, without words, the entirety of their inner world. A professional portrait painter should know double. In the end, the holy language of the Solitants was wholly redundant, and no argument could convince Mandri otherwise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That is, until a demon bit his thigh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pain woke him from his fainting spell, a pain so intense that the slightest pressure elicited a scream. The skin around the already clotted wound was taut and throbbing, a drumhead reverberating pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto tried to make him walk. This was due to a miscommunication. He and Mandri were speaking different languages. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lungs had seized and spoke in wheezing hisses. Moto took this babble as a childish unwillingness to even try to move. But the fact was, getting up was functionally impossible. In the end,  Chopper tossed Mandri atop his own giant pack, and they moved on. With each step that Chopper took, Mandri\u8217\'92s raw wound chafed against a shoulder, sending a fresh wave of excruciating pain into his groin and hip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He fainted again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He woke up the next day when Chopper leaned back and dropped him from a height like a camel dropping dung. Mandri landed hard on his wounded thigh and he let loose a gargled curse. He tried to find some twist of hip and spine that could give relief. These contortions ended with him lying all the way back and shifting most of his weight onto his right ass cheek. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 At least he could breathe more freely now. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But that meant he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t died.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Damn it all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Through the chewed-up hole in his robe he could see that his affected left thigh had been poulticed and bandaged, though it was poorly done. The brown woolen wraps were ragged and splitting apart. A few sturdy threads were all that was holding the mass of spongy, mud-dusted weed-paste together. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When the pain had settled into a manageable enough mood, he realized that Chopper dropped him was because they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d arrived at some accursed destination\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 an enormous black rock sitting lonely in the middle of a flat and sandy landscape. And it wasn\u8217\'92t just any big rock. It was a single, smooth, uncracked rock. Rocks that big in the Sand tend to be slumping things that look half-melted by the sun, but this rock, this biggest of all boulders, was a healthy, upright egg. So unnatural and precarious was its position that it seemed a strong blast of wind should be able to pick the whole thing up and send it rolling along the desert floor. Mandri felt that if he stood next to it and gave a hearty push, he could get it rolling himself. With no other rocky eminence in sight, well, that made it seem like the rock had been deliberately placed here in the middle of nowhere by the hand of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Surely, it was a holy site.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto was stooped over a huge pile of the Ayramun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s haulings some yards away. There were only two other Ayramun present, two dour looking women who milled about that pack heap. Moto and Chopper unstrapped their own pack and tossed it on top of the others.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  doing?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Moto asked the two women, }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We been looking for you,\u8221\'94 said a spritely older woman who looked ready to hunt a bull.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Looks to me, Forty, like you've been doing nothing,\u8221\'94 Moto replied. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We got told to look for you, and here we are, lookin right at you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto nodded towards Mandri. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Make sure he doesn\u8217\'92t go and do something stupid.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How about we take you to Ayram, as we been ordered to do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine with me, but someone should watch him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll do it,\u8221\'94 said the other woman. It was Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri would have preferred to be left alone, but there was no real use in arguing. He set himself to twisting to and fro to try and undo the searing knot of pain that throbbed inside his thigh and hip. He did finally find some meager relief by sticking his hand under his right ass cheek and leaning on it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He decided that he well and truly hated Moto. The sight of Moto walking away brought joy to his hand-wrung heart. He tried to recall the words to an Old Jandri curse that could kill a callous man like that, but the pain in his leg was a powerful amnestic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He set about preparing the ground around him so that he could more comfortably wallow in it. Eventually, he decided to shimmy over to the pile of packs so that he could use it as a prop, but he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d forgotten already that Seb was there.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What happened to you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri looked down at his leg.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I got bit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93By what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri dragged himself up against the pile of packs and negotiated a tenuous peace between himself and the wound in his thigh. He settled his elbow into a bag of grain and let his hip sink gently into an inside-out goat bladder stuffed with who knows what. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I say what you get bit by?\u8221\'94 Seb was standing over him know. Her skinny shadow striped his belly. \u8220\'93I smell death on you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri looked down at his poorly poulticed leg. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think I made it through the worst of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t look that way to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Last night I could hardly breathe, but now I can breathe just fine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What you get bit by?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You wouldn\u8217\'92t believe me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Try me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said you wouldn\u8217\'92t believe me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You sure it weren\u8217\'92t no lizard?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ask Moto. Actually, you know what, don\u8217\'92t ask him a damn thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You thought I was a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This was different.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe. I jus think it\u8217\'92s worth knowin\u8217\'92 there\u8217\'92s a difference about what you see, and what you think you see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri winced hard as the pain in his leg reared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Should let me look at the wound,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93May be able to do somethin\u8217\'92 for it. I won\u8217\'92t know for sure unless I see it first.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Despite Seb calm and generally amicable demeanor, there was no getting past the fact of Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s general appearance. Her mouth was a black wreck and her eyebrows, those signposts of the Spark, were barely there. That made it impossible to ascertain the intentions hidden behind her shine-black eyes. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But the pain in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s leg was stupid, and Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t think of many things worse than something stupid that refuses to go away so he scrunched up the hem of his robe to reveal the bite.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The many veins in his inner thigh ran black as ink, and nearer to the loose poultice, above his knee, those black veins were bulging above his skin like nightworms.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol\u8217\'92s light,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He gingerly unwrapped the long strip of wool that held the poultice in place. The various weedy leaves and lichens that composed the meat were too dried out to be doing any good, and he was able to flick most of it into his open palm easily enough, but the rest he had to pluck, for the pulped leaf stems closer to the flesh were caked in a gooey dark-brown emulsion of infected blood and poultice paste.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Clean it up more,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you think I\u8217\'92m doing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri kept picking until all that was left was the terrifying sight of a day-old demon bite. The edges of this fang-scalloped wound were festering and black, and this jagged ring of necrotic flesh enclosed a puddle of that brown emulsion, which had, in parts, been scraped away to reveal the red-raw muscle of his thigh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Opening the wound to the air reinvigorated the pain. Somehow it looked worse than it felt. What really got Mandri worried was how his inky black veins spidered up his thigh and in towards his crotch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s see the full of it\u8221\'94, Seb said as she leaned over the affected area.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94 Mandri quickened, and guarded his uglies from sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How your chest feel?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just hurry up and do whatever you\u8217\'92re going to do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb studied the wound with an impassive gaze, eyes darting from detail to detail, as if she were a dealer appraising a painting, and the particular texture and color of the budding scab could help her determine authenticity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hurry up,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb pulled back and said flatly, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can\u8217\'92t do anythin\u8217\'92 for ya.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That there is a demon bite.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You said you could help with the pain.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did I?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You lied.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I never lie.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bullshit, I bet you lie all the time.\u8221\'94 Mandri slapped the weedy poultice back onto his wound, and he did his best to re-roll that ragged strip of wool around it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What this place is this place anyways?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked, nodding towards the giant black rock.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Used to be where some folk mint gold coins away from pryin\u8217\'92 eyes. \u8216\'91Least, that\u8217\'92s what I been told.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How so?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri dabbed his finger against the black veins running up his thigh. That was a mistake, for the pain it kicked up was severe.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Especially Moto,\u8221\'94 Mandri hissed between breaths of pain. \u8220\'93The man is an ass. The man is a donkey wearing human skin.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My admittedly limited impression of him was that he was one of the smarter ones.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri sighed and tried to distract himself by stealing a small bag of spicy jerked beef from the mound of things. He popped one of these slips of meat into his mouth, and he tucked it into his cheek to let its flavors fix him.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Could be worse. If you\u8217\'92d be caught by Kalemites, you\u8217\'92d be ate already, and the one to eat your stomach would be wearin\u8217\'92 your sacrum strapped to his forehead.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri disagreed, but kept it to himself. He stole another slip of beef and tucked the rest back where he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d found it. He set the beef on top of his tongue, and he savored the unfamiliar blend of spices. Some strange pepper in it, and a heap of salt. He was getting thirsty now. He\u8217\'92d like some water.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could help me escape.\u8221\'94}

First one, then three, then seven of them, and last came Ayram. Each in turn took off jogging towards Mandri, Seb, and the pile of dumped goods. With Ayram at the rear it looked like the oncoming Ayramun were fleeing before a marauding giant.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb withdrew the bulging pouch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, come on,\u8221\'94 Mandri whined.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb put a shushing finger to her lips. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not s\u8217\'92posed to have these, so shut up bout em.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The first Aryamun to reach them was the short, boorish man named Hill. Hill pushed Mandri over, casually ignoring Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s agonized hoot. He picked up the pack that Mandri had been laying against, and he gave Mandri a unimpressed glare as he fluffed his own scraggly mustache with his bottom lip. Then he trotted back towards Minting Rock. The rest did much the same. Ayram was the only one to stay. He stood right over Mandri. Such was the man\u8217\'92s size that Mandri felt humbled, and humbling Mandri was no easy feat. Buried in Ayram\u8217\'92s shadow, Mandri looked up and saw all the familiar features of a man but did not match the pattern as a person. Ayram was greater, somehow more solid, a reference point for being, like an old tree, or a father in the eyes of a son.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moto!\u8221\'94 Ayram shouted. \u8220\'93Get over here!\u8221\'94}

He was hugging a bulging sack of sand-dried vegetables when he heard Ayram shout his name. He immediately dropped the sack and jogged over to see what the fuss was about.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was pleased to see that his thigh had left a swipe-stain of his own blood on the shoulder of Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s otherwise speckless garb. A small victory, but a victory.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Explain,\u8221\'94 Ayram said as he pointed to Mandri\u8217\'92s leg.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s as I said. The boy got bit by a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In the thigh?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He was trying to run away from me and he jumped into a lizard pit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No I didn\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 Mandri countered, his own voice sounding whiny even to him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Explain why this boy was running away from you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as if he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the faintest idea. Ayram glared at the man, clearly expecting an answer, so Moto cooked up some bullshit about Mandri trying to escape. His whole body got involved as he told his false story. Mandri was familiar with the technique. All that gesticulating, it wasn\u8217\'92t really about selling the lie, it was about Moto letting Ayram know that he was going to cause a fuss if he was called out on the lie, and if Ayram thought that fuss would be more trouble then the whole thing was worth, Moto might just get away with it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto finished by extending his arms all the way out to the sky and declared, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The boy\u8217\'92s an idiot!

You should have seen it, the demon was chewing on his leg and he didn\u8217\'92t even try to fight the thing off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri knew he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t speak out of turn so he was forced to resort to an incredulous gasp, and with each word that Moto spoke, Mandrameen\u8217\'92s face scrunched up tighter and tighter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he made every effort short of squealing to let Ayram know that Moto was lying.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You didn\u8217\'92t do what I told you to do,\u8221\'94 Ayram finally said. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How could I?\u8221\'94 Moto griped. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92d take twelve virgins to liven this one up! The boy has no will to live.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take the Mazid,\u8221\'94 Ayram growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto walked slowly and deliberately to where Obo lay, picked him up, tucked him under the arm, and then took off towards Minting Rock, sending back a threatening glare for Mandri before he left.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Ayram tapped out his frustration against his elbows as he stared at Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s leg.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was an ill omen, finding you dead in the hills. It took my witch a whole hand to convince me that your Spark was worth rekindling. When a man is brought back from the dead, sometimes, he comes back changed, corrupted\u8230\'85agents of Shis. Is that what you are?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The mention of Shis triggered in Mandri the memory of Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hidden basement. He tried to block all thoughts of that black painting out of his mind because he felt that Ayram\u8217\'92s wild eyes were reading his thoughts.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can you walk?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can try.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri rolled onto his stomach and pushed himself up onto his good knee, and from there, he stood up. His bad leg was as stiff as a board, though he was determined to walk on his own for he knew it would not go well for him if he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t carry his own weight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He took a step and shuddered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think I can walk, but I might be able to hobble.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram nodded. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Make your way into the rock.\u8221\'94 He reached down and grabbed Mandri\u8217\'92s left arm, and his gigantic fingers encircled the bicep a whole half over. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is good that you try to walk. An evil man would make himself a burden.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 With Mandri steadied, Ayram let go,  and moved to retrieve the last items from the Ayramun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pile. Then set off stomping back towards Minting Rock, leaving Mandri and the desert to themselves.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hopped a few steps, but his left leg still couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t bear even the slightest weight. It felt like his thigh bone had splintered, and every shuffling hop sent white shards of bone stabbing into the meat of his thigh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But it was not a great distance, so he soldiered on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 As he went he thought of the Solitants and their sacred tortures. He wondered if they had a word for the particular arc of sensations that a demon bite inflicts. He wondered what this pain would do to him, what kind of man it would make him if he toughed it out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He looked out over the empty Sand and recalled a heretical painting titled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91Oneness with the Divine\u8217\'92. It depicted a flayed Solitant lying on a rack, his skin completely unwrapped from his body, his bare anatomy exposed to the haze of incense floating around a dark room. This mortification was a ritual performed by only the most schismatic of adherents, men and women who did not want to craft the Self, but tried instead to destroy it. This particular ritual was an attempt to confront the Self with the truth that there was no edge between it and the rest of reality. The logic was as crude as the operation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 removing the skin removes the Self\u8217\'92s final boundary. There is nothing left to contain it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But no doubt the ecstasy depicted in that Solitant's face was put there by the artist. It was not possible that a person could remain conscious through such an ordeal. And Mandri refused to accept that a ritual flensing could lead a person to righteousness. What kind of world would he be living in if that were true? Such a place could only be called Shis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He made it into the shadow of Minting Rock and pressed his hand against the rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cold belly. He pushed as hard as he could. He didn\u8217\'92t expect to be able to push it over, but he had to satisfy his curiosity. It really did seem that if he stood there long enough, a strong wind would blow and the rock would roll over and squish him like a bug. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Cut into the earth at the base of the rock a hole that looked far too much like a giant drag-belly den. As there was no other way but down, he hitched on. This dark and cramped tunnel soon led him into a dead end of undressed stone stacked haphazardly like an old goatherd's fence. Above him, high up, was a circle of daylight. It seemed as if he were at the bottom of a dried-up well that had been carved all the way through the core of Minting Rock itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From above, a voice shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Grab the rope!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri fumbled about in the darkness and his hand stumbled upon a rope. He took several deep breaths to battle the pain, then he held on tight as he was hauled up into the stomach of Minting Rock.}}
