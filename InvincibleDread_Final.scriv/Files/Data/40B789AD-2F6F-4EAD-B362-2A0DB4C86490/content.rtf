At least, Mandri never heard anyone speak. If Moteah or Moto gave voice to some practical concern, he wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t aware of it. If }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 he s}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 poke, he wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t aware of it. All his senses seemed far away. He could not feel his feet squeeze inside his shoes as he ran. His palm did not tingle when he braced himself against what should have been cold and clammy stone. He was a passenger in his own body. Yet, he was never far from control, for he could, at will, reinfect his body with his Self and swivel his eyes at the iridescent threads of purpose which he was content to follow. He didn\u8217\'92t much care where they led him, but of course they led him upwards, and as he ascended, the blissful apathy which had consumed him shed its blissful skin. He was a .By the time he neared the world\u8217\'92s surface, his only worry was how firmly Moto and Moteah gripped their swords. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 His purpose led him to small, shit-stained hole that some lizards had hewn. He belly crawled through it and emerged into the outside world. It was night, blue and magnificent. He stood up, cleaned himself of the grit which clung to his sleeves, chest, and knees, and then he closed his eyes, took a deep, neck-stretched breath, and centered himself. The soreness and exhaustion his body was experiencing would have bulled him over if he if weren\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t dwelling in his own periphery. He opened his eyes and found himself standing atop a plateau in the Goree mountains. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 To the south he spied the distant sillhouette of the temple Shulgi, black rectangle set against the blue of night. He could blot it out with his thumb. To the west was the blanketed the world, while the Tib blacked the rim of the horizon.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Out of the way,\u8221\'94 Moto grumbled as he pulled himself out of the hole. When he was all the way out and standing, he took a deep breath, just as Mandri had done.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll light a fire,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Long stalks of woody haggas weed grew out of stone-cracks nearby, and Moto gathered these while Mandri pulled Moteah\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s pack through the hole. When she pulled herself out, she was quick to grab her pack back from him. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 There was an awkward tension here as she regarded him with wary eyes. Mandri wanted desperately to laugh, but somehow, he couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t. He thought he could invade his body at any time, but he simply stood there, staring at her Spark like a freak. She retreated towards her brother, and tried to be casual about it, but Mandri could feel the apprehension in posture. She and he stood around while Moto built a respectable fire, and once it was crackling, Moto permitted them to sit.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah retrieved from her pack a rare treat\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 two small bricks of cappash, which was a dried white meat spiced with bitter herbs and caked in yellowed fat. She handed one of these to Mandri and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You look like you need it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri accepted. He nibbled on a corner, thinking there\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d be no taste. He couldn\u8217\'92t feel the weight of his own body, much less the saliva in his mouth. And at first there was no taste, but with every chew and swallow, the meat\u8217\'92s musty flavor , and somehow it pulled him further into his skin, slumping further and further into his own body\u8217\'92s exhaustion. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Man, I\u8217\'92m tired,\u8221\'94 he muttered, \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suppose we could take some time to sleep?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No sleep,\u8221\'94 said Moto. He wasn\u8217\'92t eating anything. He was sitting cross-legged, hunched, appreciating the fire between them. His sword sat in his lap. \u8220\'93We need to talk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I know,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No, let me frame this conversation. Do you know my story, Mandri?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve already told him,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93So he knows that an Amalgamete killed our people?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah nodded.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sighed. It seemed he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d wanted to tell that story. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, I saw you do some things that were not wise.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t disagree.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That woman, that evil witch, she said some things that were not . And then you went and drank from her stomach.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93If you want to kill me, I would understand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 want}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  to kill you, Mandri.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah huffed and one of her trademarked stings.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t look at me like that. This could be }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 it}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 . Kill him and we could be done.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t know what Solraheen has planned for\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen is dead!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93But so is Schisol,\u8221\'94 Moteah countered. \u8220\'93And so is the Amalgamete.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders slumped. He shook his head for burden of having to explain was almost too much. \u8220\'93Mandri }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 is }{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 the Amalgamete. He }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 killed}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  Elrahet. He\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s swallowed Sparks. He\u8217\'92ll leave our chewed up stomachs hanging out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah did not deny him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t kill Elrahet,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh?\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93So she stabbed herself with your sword, is that it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes narrowed and he snorted his annoyance. \u8220\'93Mandri, I\u8217\'92m going to kill you if you don\u8217\'92t pull a mighty justification out the air. You\u8217\'92re going to need to answer to the best of your ability.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Was truth.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet could see the future,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93She could see her own death. If she wanted to stop it, she would have.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto scoffed. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93She wanted to die? A woman whose lived a hundred ages wanted to die?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t think it was so ridiculous. And when he didn\u8217\'92t answer, Moto put his question more bluntly, \u8220\'93What reason would she have for letting }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  of all people kill her? She\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s outlived kings, lords, the gods. She\u8217\'92s fought off Amalgametes and all their demons, but }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  are the one to fulfill of her purpose?\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 That did seem ridiculous. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93But Pell died too,\u8221\'94 said Moteah. \u8220\'93Elrahet might have seen that her own death would bring about the death of her eternal enemy. Think about it\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 the last Amalgamete is dead, and so is Schisol\u8217\'92s shadow. Elrahet must have seen this end, and she d.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93This is not Elrahet\u8217\'92s end, this is Pell\u8217\'92s. Or did you not see the witch cut out her stomach and feed it to Mandri?! Pell saw the future.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet saw further.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think either of them saw far into the future. I think they were taking risks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How could you possibly know that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Because I can see the future, too. I see threads of purpose. They are here for the gods to weave them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93But the gods are dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93And now that their Envoys are dead, our purpose is ours alone. That is what Elrahet wanted. That is what Solraheen wanted.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93If you can see the future, can you see what I am going to say to you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I know I\u8217\'92m not.\u8221\'94}
