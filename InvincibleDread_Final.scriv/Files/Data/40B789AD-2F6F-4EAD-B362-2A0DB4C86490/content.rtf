Or at least, if anyone did speak, Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t aware of it. All his senses were far away. He could not feel his toes squeeze inside his shoes. His palm did not tingle when he braced himself against cold stone. His legs moved without any strain or weight. Even his breathing felt like someone else\u8217\'92s. It took tremendous effort to reassert his Self and swivel his eyes down to study the iridescent threads of purpose which guided him through the dark. It was so much effort that he did it once and never again. He was not in control, so it did not matter much if he saw where he was going.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A sense of suspicion followed him. It was coming from his companions, from the way they gripped their weapons a little too tightly, from how they walked a little too close behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Perhaps he was imagining their alertness and attention.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d often project his own paranoia upon others while plunging the depths of a burgeon binge. This became a little clearer when he began to suspect that the rock itself was shaming him. Jagged streaks of feldspar were trying to convince him he didn\u8217\'92t belong. Little mounds of pebbles seemed to shy away from his approach. Then he came upon a small, shit-stained tunnel that some pregnant beast of a lizard had hewn. It was just his size. Unlike everything else, it was welcoming. He belly crawled into it, and after his body struggled a while, he emerged into the desert night.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The twinkling sky was a magnificent blue. The clean air was invigorating. He stood up, brushed off the grit which clung to his sleeves and knees, and then he closed his eyes and took a deep, neck-stretched breath. Here he caught a glimpse of the soreness that wrecked his body. It would have bulled him over if he weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t dwelling in his own periphery. Then he opened his eyes and found himself standing atop a plateau in the Goree mountains. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d come a long distance without realizing it. To the south he spied Shulgi\u8217\'92s silhouette set against the blue of night. He could blot it out with his thumb. To the west, the sand blanketed world. The Tib blacked the rim of the horizon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Out of the way,\u8221\'94 Moto grumbled as he pulled himself out of the lizard hole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Moto was all the way out and standing, he took a deep breath, just as Mandri had done.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll light a fire,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Long stalks of woody haggas weed grew out of stone-cracks nearby, and Moto gathered these while Moteah pulled herself out through the hole. She was more wary of Mandri. Mandri desperately wanted to laugh at the tension, but somehow, he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t. He simply stood there, staring at her Spark like a freak, and he stood like this while Pyetle emerged. Ayram had a bit of a struggle to fit himself through. By the time he was out, Moto a respectable little fire going, having lucked into a few twisted bone-dry branches that were strewn about. He permitted them all to sit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah retrieved from her robes two small bricks of cappash\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a dried and minced lizard meat spiced with bitter herbs and caked in yellowed fat. She handed one of these to Mandri. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look like you need it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Whatever force controlling Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body accepted the offering. He nibbled on a corner, thinking there\u8217\'92d be no taste. At first there wasn\u8217\'92t, but with the second chew, the meat\u8217\'92s smoky flavor percolated into being. Somehow the act of eating was pulling him back into his own skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t entirely enjoyable. Every swallow slumped him further and further into his body\u8217\'92s exhaustion. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol\u8217\'92s light, I\u8217\'92m tired,\u8221\'94 he mumbled between mouthfuls. \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suppose we could take some time to sleep?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No sleep,\u8221\'94 said Ayram, who wasn\u8217\'92t eating anything. He was sitting cross-legged, appreciating the fire between them. His great spear was stuck into the stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We need to talk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri licked his teeth and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle sat to his left. The siblings, to his right. They all watched with as Ayram raised Pel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach up by the entrails.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol\u8217\'92s own shadow offered you this. Do you know why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri shook his head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She named you the Burshageet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram paused to let the accusation breathe, because now that it was out the air it was its own kind of beast. It had to be dealt with.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I understand how you feel,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. Or rather, seemed to say. He wasn\u8217\'92t exactly sure what his words were, because the sound of his voice was . Whatever they were, Ayram\u8217\'92s lips drew tight and he nodded. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was not so composed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Toss it into the fire!\u8221\'94 he said eagerly. He had his hands up to frame the significance of his meaning. \u8220\'93This could be it! This is the last vestige of Schisol on this earth. Destroy it, and we\u8217\'92re done. \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram tossed the Sparked stomach into the fire.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93As can be seen,\u8221\'94 Ayram said, eyes narrowed, \u8220\'93it is no easy thing to destroy this stomach. Even if we could, the Spark inside would, in time, find its way back into another.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How did Greskal\u8217\'92s prince destroy his Spark?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everyone who would know is dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d bet Mandri could do it,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram . He grabbed his iron spear and poked the stomach back out of the fire. It rolled towards Mandri, collecting a speckled film of dirt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Having swallowed elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spark, and having the god eye sight, this raises the question: is his decision to cut the thread preordained. Is there a thread guiding him to cut the thread. Recursive thread to cut that and so on, the very particles of matter. It would require an infinite regress. An infinite amount of time. But how could such geometry be compressed?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93STOP!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The stomach was suddenly cupped in his hands. His teeth were . }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Spit it out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri did.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 He}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  is the Burshageet!\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Moto cried. \u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s swallowed one great Spark already. We\u8217\'92ll be next. Then the world!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t know that,\u8221\'94 Moteah said. \u8220\'93The Burshageet is dead, and so is Schisol\u8217\'92s Shadow. Remember that Elrahet saw this end and chose it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto scoffed at this suggestion. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How is this an \u8216\'91end\u8217\'92? Look at him!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri eyes on him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Our enemy could read the future, too. She also chose this path. She chose to cut out her stomach when Elrahet was already dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pytele -}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You say these two witches had been fighting each other for\u8230\'85for however long\u8230\'85I wonder if they both got tired and simply decided to let things fall where they may.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But Elrahet was dead,\u8221\'94 Moto replied. \u8220\'93Evil was winning. Why would Schisol\u8217\'92s Shadow kill herself on the brink of victory? She\u8217\'92d only do it if victory were assured}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 .}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe she knew she could not defeat Mandri. Her only chance, then, was to try and corrupt him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is already corrupted.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have faith that Solraheen would know the difference.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen is dead!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yet this Mazid bears His fire\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 you all watched him turn back the hordes of Shis, and you want to kill him for it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His question hung in the air unanswered, but Moto was able to sneer his way through this complication. He stood up, shook his sister\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grasping hand away, then swipe-flicked his blade through the air to remember its weight before setting its edge to Mandri\u8217\'92s neck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Give me a reason not to kill you,\u8221\'94 he snarled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri spoke, and his own voice frightened him, for it was not him who was speaking. The sound was his, and the cadence too, but the force of the words were someone else\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can see the future, too,\u8221\'94 he said as he stared into the soft glow of Moto\u8217\'92s Spark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And in it, you live?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t see very far,\u8221\'94 Mandri said calmly. \u8220\'93I can only see that you won\u8217\'92t kill me just now. Perhaps tomorrow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sneer deepened. It seemed for a moment that he really might strike, but there was a thin thread of purpose drawing his sword away. He would not kill Mandrameen. This did not mean that he did not want to do it. It was clear from his unwavering gaze and firmly planted feet that he did.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah was standing beside him now, pawing at his shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if killing him is the end that Evil saw? What if that witch offered her stomach so that you would grow discontinet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  The logic of this twisted Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. The simple logic disturbed him\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 kill Mandri, and he might save or doom the world in equal measure. Or, Mandri could be of no consequence at all. There was no way for him to know.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He finally dropped his guard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stepped back and sheathed his sword.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What they thought of him. Ayram thought him weak. Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes saw in him a demigod. Moto could only see potential danger, while Moteah\u8217\'92s pity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri smiled at how he could mean such different things to different people}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Alternatively. Find him in the difference.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri cut the thread, and unwed himself completely from the world.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0}
