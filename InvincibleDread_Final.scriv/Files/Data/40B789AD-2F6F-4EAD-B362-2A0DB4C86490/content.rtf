At least, Mandri never heard anyone speak. If Moteah or Moto gave voice to some practical concern, he wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t aware of it. If }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 he s}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 poke, he wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t aware of it. All his senses seemed far away. He could not feel his feet squeeze inside his shoes as he ran. His palm did not tingle when he braced himself against what should have been cold and clammy stone. He was a passenger in his own body. Yet, he was never far from control, for he could, at will, reinfect his body with his Self and swivel his eyes at the iridescent threads of purpose which he was content to follow. He didn\u8217\'92t much care where they led him, but of course they led him upwards, and as he ascended, the blissful apathy which had consumed him shed its blissful skin. He was a .By the time he neared the world\u8217\'92s surface, his only worry was how firmly Moto and Moteah gripped their swords. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 His purpose led him to small, shit-stained hole that some lizards had hewn. He belly crawled through it and emerged into the outside world. It was night, blue and magnificent. He stood up, cleaned himself of the grit which clung to his sleeves, chest, and knees, and then he closed his eyes, took a deep, neck-stretched breath, and centered himself. The soreness and exhaustion his body was experiencing would have bulled him over if he if weren\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t dwelling in his own periphery. He opened his eyes and found himself standing atop a plateau in the Goree mountains. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 To the south he spied the distant sillhouette of the temple Shulgi, black rectangle set against the blue of night. He could blot it out with his thumb. To the west was the blanketed the world, while the Tib blacked the rim of the horizon.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Out of the way,\u8221\'94 Moto grumbled as he pulled himself out of the hole. When he was all the way out and standing, he took a deep breath, just as Mandri had done.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll light a fire,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Long stalks of woody haggas weed grew out of stone-cracks nearby, and Moto gathered these while Mandri pulled Moteah\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s pack through the hole. When she pulled herself out, she was quick to grab her pack back from him. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 There was an awkward tension here as she regarded him with wary eyes. Mandri wanted desperately to laugh, but somehow, he couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t. He thought he could invade his body at any time, but he simply stood there, staring at her Spark like a freak. She retreated towards her brother, and tried to be casual about it, but Mandri could feel the apprehension in posture. She and he stood around while Moto built a respectable fire, and once it was crackling, Moto permitted them to sit.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah retrieved from her pack a rare treat\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 two small bricks of cappash, which was a dried white meat spiced with bitter herbs and caked in yellowed fat. She handed one of these to Mandri and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You look like you need it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri accepted. He nibbled on a corner, thinking there\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d be no taste. He couldn\u8217\'92t feel the weight of his own body, much less the saliva in his mouth. And at first there was no taste, but with every chew and swallow, the meat\u8217\'92s musty flavor , and somehow it pulled him further into his skin, slumping further and further into his own body\u8217\'92s exhaustion. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Man, I\u8217\'92m tired,\u8221\'94 he muttered, \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suppose we could take some time to sleep?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No sleep,\u8221\'94 said Moto. He wasn\u8217\'92t eating anything. He was sitting cross-legged, hunched, appreciating the fire between them. His sword sat in his lap. \u8220\'93We need to talk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I know,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No, let me frame this conversation. Do you know my story, Mandri?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve already told him,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93So he knows that an Amalgamete killed our people?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah nodded.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sighed. It seemed he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d wanted to tell that story. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, I saw you do some things that were not wise.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t disagree.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That woman, that evil witch, she said some things that were not . And then you went and drank from her stomach.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93If you want to kill me, I would understand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 want}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  to kill you.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah huffed. A sibling knows when the other is lying.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t look at me like that,\u8221\'94 Moto protested. \u8220\'93This could be }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 it}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 . Kill him and we could be done. Evil would be dead for good.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t know what Solraheen has planned for\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen is dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93But so is Schisol,\u8221\'94 Moteah countered. \u8220\'93And so is the Amalgamete.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders slumped. He shook his head for burden of having to explain was almost too much. \u8220\'93Mandri }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 is }{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 the Amalgamete. He }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 killed}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  Elrahet. He\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s swallowed Sparks. He\u8217\'92ll leave our chewed up stomachs hanging out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah did not deny him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t kill Elrahet,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh?\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93So she stabbed herself with your sword, is that it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes narrowed and he snorted his annoyance. \u8220\'93Mandri, I\u8217\'92m going to kill you if you don\u8217\'92t pull a mighty justification out the air. You\u8217\'92re going to need to answer to the best of your ability.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Was truth.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet could see the future,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93She could see her own death. If she wanted to stop it, she would have.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto scoffed. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93She wanted to die? A woman who lived a hundred ages }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 wanted}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  to die?\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 When Mandri didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t answer, Moto leaned forward and put more force into his question. \u8220\'93What reason would she have for letting you of all people kill her? She outlived the gods. She fought off kings of demons and men, but }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  are the one to fulfill of her purpose?\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s voice always found his arguments as easily as a swordsman\u8217\'92s fingers found their sword, but at present, his tongue was fumbling. And to make matters worse, the more he thought about who Elrahet was and why she did what she did, the more he was squeezed back into his body\u8217\'92s periphery. The last thing he felt as he slipped out of his face was a warm vibration in his cheeks, and then a snap of cold ran through him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes lit up, and excitement lifted her cheeks. \u8220\'93Elrahet would have seen what her own death would bring.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93She couldn\u8217\'92t have seen this,\u8221\'94 Moto said as he gestured towards Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93But what if she did? Think about it\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 the last Amalgamete is dead, and so is Schisol\u8217\'92s shadow. Elrahet must have seen this end and accepted it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto eyed his sister with slack-jawed disbelief. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Did you not see that evil bitch cut out her stomach and feed it to Mandri? She could see the future too, couldn\u8217\'92t she? Why would she do such a thing if she couldn\u8217\'92t see how it would end?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 His question hung in the air unanswered. When he stood up, Moteah did too, and she stopped him from marching around the fire. She set her hand on his swords hilt and said \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Killing him is what Pell would have wanted.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How does that make any sense?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What if he isn\u8217\'92t the Amalgamete, and she only said that he is to get you to kill him?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto elbowed his sister in the gut, and as she doubled over, he pushed her aside and stepped towards Mandri. He he swept his blade through the air to remember its weight, and he set its edge to Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s neck.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri spoke, and his own voice frightened him, for it was not him who was speaking. Yes, the sound was his, and cadence too, but }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I can see the future, too,\u8221\'94 he said as he stared into soft glow of Moto\u8217\'92s Spark. \u8220\'93I see threads of purpose. They run in front of our Selves so that the gods might weave them, but the gods are dead. Our purpose is ours alone. This is what Elrahet wanted. This is what Solraheen wanted.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They want me to let you live?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, calmly. \u8220\'93They want you to be free to do what you want\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 nothing more or less.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93And what of Pell?\u8221\'94 The edge in Moto\u8217\'92s voice was as sharp as his blade. But it did not bother Mandri. He said, \u8220\'93She wants the same as the others. She wants for you to do what you want. Only, she thinks she knows you better.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sneered at the implication that he was predictable. No one could know which way his sword would cut except for him. It seemed for a moment that he might strike back, but Mandri saw a thin thread of purpose drawing Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s sword away.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto would not kill Mandrameen.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 This did not mean that Moto did not want to do it. It was clear from his unwavering gaze and firmly planted feet that he did. But in the breath before he delivered his final stroke of judgment, a paralyzing uncertainty dumbed his features and stayed his hand.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He clenched his teeth and hissed.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri watched with fascination as Moto struggled against the most merciless of uncertainties, uncertainty of consequence, that bane of reason, that womb of fear. A single cup of this uncertainty could dissolve the resolve of an entire nation. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Kill Mandri, and Moto might save or doom the world in equal measure. Or, Mandri could be of no consequence at all.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Who was he to know?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The turmoil played out in Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes, and his dropped guard let Mandri see the man\u8217\'92s true Self clearly, for floating inside that fear of consequence was mercy and compassion and a Spark yearning to understand and be understood. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Come Moteah,\u8221\'94 Moto said as he stepped back and sheathed his sword. \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re leaving.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The sudden suggestion snapped Mandri back into the moment. His own fear gripped him, fear of being left alone. He knew, , and the very thought pushed him further back from world. Even now he thrashed against the pull of letting go. To speak, he had to clench his gut to push a word out of his own reluctant throat, a word which he had never said and thought he never would.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Help.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was . Mandri sensed fear and disgust.}
