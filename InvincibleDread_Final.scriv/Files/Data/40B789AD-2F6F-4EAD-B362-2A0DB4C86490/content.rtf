At least, Mandri never heard anyone speak. If Moteah or Moto gave voice to some practical concern, he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t aware of it, for all his senses seemed so far away. He could not feel his feet squeeze inside his shoes as he ran. His palm did not tingle when he braced himself against cold and clammy stone. He was a passenger inside his own body. His own breathing was someone else\u8217\'92s. It took tremendous effort to reassert his Self and swivel his eyes to study the iridescent threads of purpose which guided him through the dark. It was so much effort that he did it once and never again. The threads would lead him whether or not he followed. And of course, it led him upwards, towards the world\u8217\'92s surface. His only worries were the suspicious stares from Moto and Moteah. He thought they gripped their swords a little too tightly. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His purpose eventually led him to a small, shit-stained hole that some pregnant beast of a lizard had hewn. He belly crawled through it and emerged into the desert night.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The twinkling sky was a magnificent blue. The clean air was invigorating. He stood up, brushed off the grit which clung to his sleeves, chest, and knees, and then he closed his eyes and took a deep, neck-stretched breath. The soreness and exhaustion his body was experiencing would have bulled him over if he weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t dwelling in his own periphery. Then he opened his eyes and found himself standing atop a plateau in the Goree mountains. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To the south he spied Shulgi\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s distant silhouette set against the blue of night. He could blot it out with his thumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To the west, the sand blanketed world. The Tib blacked the rim of the horizon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Out of the way,\u8221\'94 Moto grumbled as he pulled himself out of the hole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he was all the way out and standing, he took a deep breath, just as Mandri had done.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll light a fire,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Long stalks of woody haggas weed grew out of stone-cracks nearby, and Moto gathered these while Mandri pulled Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack out through the hole. When Moteah was out and standing, she was quick to snatch her pack back from him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She was wary of him. Mandri desperately wanted to laugh, but somehow, he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t. He simply stood there, staring at her Spark like a freak, and he stood like this until Moto built a respectable fire. Once the flames were crackling, Moto permitted them all to sit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah retrieved from her pack a rare treat\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 two small bricks of cappash, which was a dried and minced lizard meat spiced with bitter herbs and caked in yellowed fat. She handed one of these to Mandri. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look like you need it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Whatever force controlling Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body accepted the offering. He nibbled on a corner, thinking there\u8217\'92d be no taste. He couldn\u8217\'92t feel the weight of his own flesh, much less the saliva in his mouth. And at first there was no taste, but with the second chew, the meat\u8217\'92s smokey flavor percolated into being. Somehow the act of eating was pulling him back into his own skin. It wasn\u8217\'92t entirely enjoyable. Every swallow slumped him further and further into his body\u8217\'92s exhaustion. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol\u8217\'92s light, I\u8217\'92m tired,\u8221\'94 he mumbled between mouthfuls. \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suppose we could take some time to sleep?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No sleep,\u8221\'94 said Moto, who wasn\u8217\'92t eating anything. He was sitting cross-legged, hunched, appreciating the fire between them. His sword sat gleaming in his lap. \u8220\'93We need to talk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri licked his teeth and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Of where to begin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you know my story, Mandri?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve already told him,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He knows that an Burshageet killed our people?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto had his hands up now, as if to frame the significance of what he was about to say. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, I saw you do some things that were not wise. And I saw that evil witch\u8230\'85she said some things that concerned me. Then you went and drank from her stomach. Mandri, she called you the Burshageet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He paused to make sure that Mandri understood what he was implying. Mandri did.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you want to kill me,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, \u8220\'93I would understand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lips drew tight and he nodded. He said to his sister, \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t look at me like that. This could be it. Kill him and we could be done. All the evil in the world would be gone and dead for good.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah narrowed her eyes. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know that\u8217\'92s not true.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But Solraheen is dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So is Schisol,\u8221\'94 Moteah countered. \u8220\'93And so is the Burshageet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto gripped his knees, and he shook his head. The burden of having to explain himself was almost too much. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  the Burshageet. He swallowed Sparks. We\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ll be next. Then the world.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah did not deny him. She looked to Mandri, stern as ever, clearly expecting him to defend himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t kill Elrahet,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh?\u8221\'94 said Moto, snorting his annoyance. \u8220\'93I did not say that you did. What a thing to say\u8230\'85I should ill you, you understand? You\u8217\'92re going to need to answer to the best of your ability. Mighty words. Do you understand?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Couldn\u8217\'92t Elrahet could see the future?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked. \u8220\'93Couldn\u8217\'92t she see her own death? Didn\u8217\'92t she }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 choose}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  this?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto scoffed at this suggestion. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet wanted to die? A woman who lived a thousand ages wanted to die?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t answer, Moto leaned forward and put more force into his question. \u8220\'93What reason would she have for letting you, of all people, have her Spark? She outlived gods. She fought off kings of demons and men. But you are the one to end her purpose?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice always found his arguments as easily as a swordsman\u8217\'92s fingers found their sword, but at present, his tongue was fumbling. And to make matters worse, the more he thought about who Elrahet was and why she did what she did, the more he was squeezed back into his body\u8217\'92s periphery. A warm vibration in his cheeks. Then a snap of cold ran through him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes lit up, and excitement lifted her cheeks. \u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93Think about it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the last Burshageet is dead, and so is Schisol\u8217\'92s shadow. Elrahet must have seen this end and accepted it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto eyed his sister with slack-jawed disbelief. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you not see that evil bitch cut out her own stomach? She could see the future too, couldn\u8217\'92t she? Why would she do such a thing if she couldn\u8217\'92t see how it would end?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His question hung in the air unanswered, and when he saw that Mandri would never answer, he stood up and brandished his sword. Moteah pulled on his robe as he swept by her. She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if he isn\u8217\'92t the Burshageet, and that evil witch only said that he was to get you to kill him? What if he\u8217\'92s here to bring good?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sneered his way through this complication and pushed his sister aside to step towards Mandri. He swipe-flicked his blade through the air to remember its weight, and he set its edge to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Give me a reason not to kill you,\u8221\'94 he snarled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri spoke, and his own voice frightened him, for it was not him who was speaking. The sound was his, and the cadence too, but the force of the words were someone else\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can see the future, too,\u8221\'94 he said as he stared into the soft glow of Moto\u8217\'92s Spark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And in it, you live?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Mandri said calmly. \u8220\'93They want you to be free to do what you want\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 nothing more or less.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And what of the evil witch whose Spark you swallowed?\u8221\'94 The edge in Moto\u8217\'92s voice was as sharp as his blade. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pytele -}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I may.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen knows that we all do what we want to do. Under everything, that\u8217\'92s how it is. The old witch believed you will want what is right, The dark witch thinks she knows you better.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sneered at the implication that he was in any way predictable. No one could know which way his sword would cut except for him. And it seemed for a moment that he might strike back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But Moto would not kill Mandrameen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This did not mean that Moto did not want to do it. It was clear from his unwavering gaze and firmly planted feet that he did. But in the breath before he delivered his final stroke, a paralyzing uncertainty dumbed his features and stayed his hand. Mandri saw a thin thread of purpose drawing Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sword away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto clenched his teeth and hissed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He struggled against the most merciless uncertainty, that bane of progress, that womb of fear. A single cup of this uncertainty could dissolve the resolve of an entire nation. Kill Mandri, and Moto might save or doom the world in equal measure. Or, Mandri could be of no consequence at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Who was he to know?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The turmoil played on his face, and his dropped guard let Mandri see his true Self clearly, for floating inside that fear of consequence was mercy and compassion, his was a Spark yearning to understand and be understood. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto stepped back and sheathed his sword. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re leaving.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This simple command shattered Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s equanimity more than the threat of death, for in slipped the fear of being left alone. Mandri knew that if he were left alone in this vast expanse that he might blur beyond all hope for reassembly. And with Mandrameen lost, what would he become? Even now, a presence pulled at the veil behind his eyes, and it clutched at his throat. He was forced to clench his gut to squeeze out a single word, a word which he had never said and thought he never would.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Give me the knife.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not up to you. I want the knife.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Moteah hestiated, he added. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is not the only piece of Fabled Black. I will find another. Give it here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She did. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri cut the thread, and unwed himself completely from the world.}
