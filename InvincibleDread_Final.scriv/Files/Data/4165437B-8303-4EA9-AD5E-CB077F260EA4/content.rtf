Erud\u8217\'92s palm wine was bright and refreshing, accented with honey. Mandri drank his fill, often to the point of obliteration, and he\u8217\'92d stuff his face with peach chicken potstickers and pickled lizard pluck, all while admiring the paintings of the Lady Tumule.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri liked the Lady\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s work. She had no equal\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 surpassed by many, yes, but no true equal. She was decent. She was a painter\u8217\'92s painter, and that meant the subtleties of her brush were completely lost on the Hrkan elite.  Mandri saw in her a kindred Spark, woman though she was, and he was inspired by almost everything she did, and that included how she died. She killed herself by jumping from a balcony that overlooked the sea.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had scribbled a few compositions of that moment, the moment just before the jump. He put Tumule standing on a white stone banister with waist-length hair wind-blown against her figure, hugging her, when nobody else would. Strangely, he could never find someone to put up funds for the finished piece.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 On one of those lazy days spent idling around Erud\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s halls, he saw a rare sight\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 one of the one hundred and twenty Voices was admiring Tumule\u8217\'92s paintings. The old man stopped to contemplate each piece, an especially curious sight because this was Pogan, a rough and tumble fellow who\u8217\'92d risen up from the rumble of the Vessels. A battle hardened fanatic. He looked more likely to chew on the canvas than lose himself in the sweep of color. Not the usual foppish pimp that makes a show of art appreciation. But he was there, and he struck a most thoughtful pose before Lady Tumule\u8217\'92s greatest work, a painting titled, \u8220\'93The Shadow over Goriol Valley\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s opinion of the piece was that it was a work of meager genius\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 meager, but only because he could not, on principle, admit the existence of true genius. The painting was good. The scene was set low in the lowest run of the Goriol Valley trail, looking up at the ridge line which sheltered the valley from the west. The sun was setting behind that ridge, so most of the scene was covered in shadow, full of blues and purples, as well as muddy grays that seemed almost red when put against those cooler hues. Near the bottom of the piece, in the middle distance, was a sinuous, slow flowing creek. Its water was fully red.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That creek is the first thing the viewer sees as one walks towards the painting from afar, for not only is the red creek spotlighted by the sun peeking over the ridge, but the composition is structured in such a way that the eye is drawn to a stepping-stone waterfall that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s set on a golden third. Below this waterfall, bobbing in its pool, is a brown lump of something strange. Step a little closer and it becomes clear that this lump is a lifeless body. Yes, the water isn\u8217\'92t stained red by clay or vegetable matter, it is blood red. Then a realization dawns: the valley slope above is composed almost entirely of human corpses.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One almost has to squint to see the bodies, but they are there, soldiers all, brown bodies folded and crumpled on top of each other like a storm had plucked them up in highlands, like grass seeds, and then dumped them there in that valley. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Voice Pogan stood in front of this painting, and he said to himself, he said it out loud, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This must be the worst painting I\u8217\'92ve ever seen.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Now, how could such a man deign to say such a thing? Mere ignorance did not cover it. Pogan was a Lordly Voice, and as such he would have seen the finest paintings in all the world. This particular painting was better than all of them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Perhaps he was suggesting that Tumule did not accurately portray the embattled dead. Perhaps she should have stuck to what she knew, and painted fruit and flowers instead. Perhaps a sheltered woman could not possibly capture the numinous beauty of a dead body piled on top of twenty others. No doubt Pogan had seen such piles. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d probably ordered them made.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had always assumed that Pogan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s opinion had no merit. Then the battle of Minting Rock happened, and a good seventy something Hrkan Vessels died, and most of the Ayramun as well. Ayram directed whoever was still alive to gather up the dead, Hrk and poke alike, and put them into a big pile. Not a pile, really, he said he wanted a sphere.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Now, a pile of bodies does not naturally take a sphere\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shape. So, Mandri was told to construct a large bowl out of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s rubble. He then spent the afternoon building that giant bowl, and he did a terrible job on account of the hobble in his leg, the ache in his mood, and his general desire to be useless. When the bodies were eventually tossed into this leaky bowl they made a regular old lump\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 not a sphere. No one seemed to care. An effort had been made and an effort was enough.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 By twilight, the grim deed was finished. The dead were all together, and Mandri was allowed to creep away. He sat alone atop a heap of rocks. He washed his sandy mouth out with water. He munched on some Hrkan hardtack he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d gathered from a dead man\u8217\'92s robe. He didn\u8217\'92t swallow, and he couldn\u8217\'92t taste a thing, not that there was anything to taste. Hardtack was nasty on purpose to keep campaigning Vessels from eating it all too quickly. But, Mandri munched anyway. He wanted to distract himself from the truth of Voice Pogan\u8217\'92s disgusted remark. Yes, that pile of bodies he\u8217\'92d helped assemble did not resemble what Tumule had painted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was significantly more blood in Tumule\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s vision. As well, her dead bodies were more seductive, though that was just how people were painted, living or dead. Her bodies were well-muscled and well-naked, or half-naked. They looked like they\u8217\'92d just stepped out of a bath instead of choking each-other in the clay. It was a typical dramatic device\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the perfection of youth cut down before its time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but Tumule\u8217\'92s message went further than that, for Tumule came from a school of artists who thought they had important things to say. She wanted to make people aware, as if they weren\u8217\'92t already, of mankind\u8217\'92s abiding concupiscence. Her subject was war, but her angle was the perversion of love, lust, and desire.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her battlefield lay strewn with naked men lying upon naked men. They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d all come down from their passionate trance, where reason gave way to baser instinct, where they wrestled, where their limbs tangled, and where their weapons, phallic, penetrated, stabbed into slits that bleed. It was all quite pointed and homoerotic, with eyes rolled back, jaws slack. Evidently ecstasy and death looked the same, and so did struggle and sex\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 if one side isn\u8217\'92t satisfied, perhaps they go at it again until everyone is utterly spent.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri surveyed the rubble of Minting Rock, as well as his own memory of the battle, and there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a lick of sexual energy in any of it. No love, no lust, no desire. Perhaps Tumule\u8217\'92s point was that hate is the perversion of all these things, but there wasn\u8217\'92t even hate here, not really. It all just kind of happened. The Hrks showed up, and they were Hrks, and that was that.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A woman named Forty could not be found, and that set the mood of the Ayramun careening into a fog of gloom. She had been well-liked. Seb had seen her jump into the fray, before the collapse, and that meant she was entombed in the bottom of Minting Rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s central well.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Chopper\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s death was unnecessary. He\u8217\'92d lived through the collapse, but in a fit of chop-lust he sprinted towards a Hrkan soldier and got walloped by Ayram\u8217\'92s spear. Ayram was not forthcoming about how this happened. All he said was, \u8220\'93Fool got in the way\u8221\'94. Chopper\u8217\'92s body told some of the story. His ribs were shattered, and his lips were stained by his own blood. He\u8217\'92d died choking on it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Bush-headed Tob had been unlucky. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d survived the first half of Minting Rock splitting off, but from the way Moto told it, the second half\u8217\'92s collapse sent a leg-sized shard of stone whistling down in Tob\u8217\'92s direction. If Tob had been standing a step to either side, he would have survived.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch Elrahet survived, as witches always do. She was busy mumbling witchy incantations while she laid her hands on the pile of dead. Moteah was beside her, managing a meager flame that illuminated nothing as she tried, pitifully, to shield it from the wind with the ragged poultice on her nubby wrist. The rest of the surviving Ayramun\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram, Seb, and Moto\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 were busy doing something or other. Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t care to find out because he\u8217\'92d bumped against the thought that he shouldn\u8217\'92t even be here. He should be back in Meskalim, laying in his field and getting high on burgeons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 High as the uglies on a too-tall horse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Folks in Eez call it tickleberried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And why wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t he high right now?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 These damned Ayramun, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s why.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He felt the urge to announce his displeasure. More than that, he wished to curse these pokes to a long life of misery. Unfortunately, for a curse to work it must be uttered within earshot of the intended, and that wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t do him much good. Besides, curses didn\u8217\'92t really work at all. All they did, really, was give a little joy when the intended target realizes that you\u8217\'92re trying to curse them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya look mad to be alive,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb was idling up on high on a towering rock. She hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t bothered to wipe herself clean of sand, so she still looked like a petrified root. She hopped down from her perch, then ambled over to invade what little space Mandri had claimed for himself. She sat right down next to him and said, half-singing, \u8220\'93I know what you neeeed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She patted a pouch which bulged her robe at the side of her hip: Burgeons. Blessed bulbous beauties. The very moment he begins to despair, they appear. That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s why he loved burgeons so much, they could be relied upon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb was chewing a spine extremely slowly, like her jaw was made of tar, giving the impression that she had sipped at least one burgeon dry already. She chuckled. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93First we gotta sort ya out,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93An \u8216\'91fore that, I gotta tell you somethin\u8217\'92, now that I got ya here.\u8221\'94 She leaned in to whisper, like what she was about to say the most profound thing imaginable. \u8220\'93Ya been pinched by the hand of god.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri blinked dumbly, then reached for Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burgeon pouch. Seb slapped his hand away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ever hear a tell of the dent who stole the legs of the Lybion martyrs?\u8221\'94 she asked. \u8220\'93Them bones were as watched as the sun, an\u8217\'92 some damn fool stole \u8216\'91em. He got caught, an\u8217\'92 know what he said in defense? He said, \u8216\'91I did what I did, cause the hand of Solraheen pinched me\u8217\'92 to do it.\u8221\'94 She paused to make room for some great insight. \u8220\'93Then he said that if old Sol didn\u8217\'92t want him to have those sacred legs, then Sol wouldn\u8217\'92t have let him steal \u8216\'91em. The Hrks said, if Sol wanted a thief to keep his head, Sol wouldn\u8217\'92t have let him get caught! So they cut off his head for stealin\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was now certain that she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d at least }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 licked}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  a burgeon, because she stared at him like she couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t believe the size of his nose. Her burgeonsight might have turned his nose into something else entirely.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya follow?\u8221\'94 she asked impatiently.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri gave no hint of an answer, so she searched his face for one. When she couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t parse his smirk, she stared into his eyes, which is to say she stared into him, right down into him with her burgeon-brights.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Course ya don\u8217\'92t follow,\u8221\'94 she crowed. \u8220\'93Square wheel\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She grabbed the neck of his robe. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She led him around the mound of Minting rock, towards the arena-like clearing in the middle. There, Ayram sat. The giant had his broad back turned, sandy skin exposed to the evening sun. He was sitting on a wooden stool that had been scavenged from wreckage. The stool squeaked and groaned every time he shifted his great weight. The man himself was perfectly silent, the perfect picture of endurance as Elrahet sewed up the nasty gash that wrapped around his left side. She washed away the blood and sand as she worked, brushing his tightly sculpted skin with a wet rag. And tightly sculpted was putting it mildly\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Aryam was animal skinny, and strong. Each time he lifted his arm to give Elrahet clearance to scrub, the striations in his shoulders popped and his shoulder blade melted into a pool of rippling flesh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He glanced over his shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, you glob of spit!\u8221\'94 he shouted. \u8220\'93We been waiting half a hand!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Half-a-hand was a famous measure of time amongst burgeon biters. It was called \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91the misjudgable\u8217\'92, as it was the amount of time it took for a good, strong burgeon to seize the mind. The presence of the misjudgable here was a coincidence which could not be ignored, it meant Seb hadn\u8217\'92t just licked a burgeon, she\u8217\'92d sucked it dry and then waited before stumbling back to her master. Somehow, she was of sound enough mind to duck under Ayram\u8217\'92s charge with a reverent bow. She managed to avoid apologizing, too. \u8220\'93When I never do what I say I gonna do?\u8221\'94 she asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram winced as Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s needle nicked a rib.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I told you to get the Mazida}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 riga}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 , not the Mazid,\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 he said, eying Mandri with some disgust.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh,\u8221\'94 Seb muttered, then shuffled off.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Meanwhile, Elrahet battled against Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s impatience, and after a brief fuss, the giant slapped his knees, stood up, and shooed her away. He twisted back and forth to test the stitchwork. This sent a stream of blood dribbling down towards his hip. Elrahet tried to get him to sit back down, but Seb shuffled back in, hauling a black-robed body over her shoulder. It was the child freak, called a Mazidariga. It was dead. Seb dropped it, and its big head smacked the sand with an uncomfortable thump.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s time,\u8221\'94 Ayram said to Elrahet. \u8220\'93Do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet muttered a complaint to Solraheen, then waddled over to Riga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s side.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The first thing she did was straighten the Riga out so that it looked like a member of the respectable dead instead of a rag doll. She knelt beside its head, making sure the skirt of her robe folded nicely to make a pillow for her creaky knees. Her eyes turned to the setting sun, whose belly sank below the horizon. The sky was an unusual reddish tint, bruised and rotting, a fitting backdrop to the blood-tingling speech which ushered from Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s throat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her words were so polluted with guttural urks that Mandri wondered if they were words at all. Not even toad belches sounded so much like gibberish. She croaked through a garbled, breathless verse, then bent over the Riga child. Her Black blade appeared in her hand. She cut the air around the Riga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face and stomach, freeing it from some invisible tether, and when that was done, she raised her blade high and brought it down hard into Riga\u8217\'92s black-robed belly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Riga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes flicked open. They bulged, began to extrude out of their skull, two bloodshot spheres shedding lids. One red eye twisted left towards Ayram, the other twisted right.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s boot stomped down on the Riga\u8217\'92s shoulder as Elrahet barked an ugly word. The Riga\u8217\'92s whole body juddered. Its little legs convulsed. She pushed down on the Riga\u8217\'92s chest with her free hand to steady the poor creature, and when the jerking finally stopped, she ripped the blade from the stomach, bent over the wound, and set her lips upon it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Every fiber of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s being wanted to look away from this indignity, but he couldn\u8217\'92t; such is the allure of profane things. A witch slurping up blood from the hole in a freak\u8217\'92s belly was something to see.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A trickle of red dripped from her scrunched-up lips.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She swallowed and stilled herself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She looked pale. It seemed the stew dripping down her throat did not pass instinct\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s inspection. Her stomach grumbled as loud as she did, and when it became too much, she stuck a finger into her mouth and vomited out a stream of blood and chunks of viscera. This redpink web of slime splatted onto the ground, glummed up with sand, seeped down, leaving a dark stain, like a map of the many-fingered sea, dotted with fleshy islands.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet hovered over that stain and traced the splatted shape with her blade. She studied the crooks in its many tendrils. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The future remains open to us,\u8221\'94 she grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her pronouncement was chased away by a loud crack of bone as Ayram decapitated the Riga child with the chisel head of his spud bar spear. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks are sure to have more of these things,\u8221\'94 he said as he picked up the bleeding head. \u8220\'93If it can track a Mazid, I don\u8217\'92t see how we make it.\u8221\'94 He held the head up to the fading sun, expecting Sol\u8217\'92s light to illuminate the secrets hidden in the Riga\u8217\'92s crafted flesh. And crafted it was, for there was a stitched seam in its skin, showing how it had been sewn together like any old vegetable sack. This faint line ran around the back of its head, around the small, chubby ears and down what was left of the neck. Ayram tried to take a knife to it, but there was the matter of the strange, metal-plated muzzle fastened to the Riga\u8217\'92s face. Ayram fiddled with this, to little avail. Then he tried to rip it off, but the whole contraption had been riveted to the mandible. Ayram, unbothered, continued to pull until there came another loud crack and a spray of blood. The Riga\u8217\'92s lower jaw nearly struck Mandri\u8217\'92s forehead when Ayram tossed it aside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was a careful study of human anatomy, and the bleeding head undone in Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hands was not, strictly speaking, human. The tongue hung off the upper palate, and there were iron staples in the back of the exposed throat which stretched open an orifice packed with tubes of woven cord. Fragments of these tubes reappeared lower down the neck, where Ayram\u8217\'92s chisel had crushed the hanging spine. It was all beyond his reckoning. Beyond Ayram\u8217\'92s too. Perhaps the giant was expecting to find some internal compass which pointed right at Mandri\u8217\'92s Sparkless stomach, as that would explain how a Riga could sense him over such a great distance. Such a device might be defeated. But fleshwork is a dark art, and dark arts are both ancient and avant-garde, intelligible only to minds with predilections for both the long-forgotten and the yet-to-be-discovered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Naturally, all eyes turned to Elrahet. Ayram held the head low for her to take. She refused with a scowl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Make what sense you can,\u8221\'94 Ayram said, almost shoving the bleeding head in her face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hear yourself,\u8221\'94 Elrahet growled as she pushed Ayram\u8217\'92s offer away. \u8220\'93What sense is there to be found in abomination?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Frustration unsteadied Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brow. He tossed the spoiled head next to her hip. \u8220\'93We cannot reach the Goree if we\u8217\'92re hunted by the Hrks. We might as well light ourselves on fire to save them the trouble.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have faith,\u8221\'94 Elrahet grouched. \u8220\'93Stare at the sun, if need be. Ours is not a path for questioners.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should have told me about these Mazidariga.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh?\u8221\'94 Elrahet scoffed. \u8220\'93Are you a seer now, too? Can you spy the lines which bind us to the future? No? Am I the only one who can? Hear yourself! A little knowledge squirts you in the eye and you get ideas. Well, know this\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 had I told you of the Riga, you would have changed}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1  }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 our course. We would be, this very moment, stumbling blind into a nest of battles.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You knew of the Riga? It wasn\u8217\'92t a rumor?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That Riga was tracking our Mazid the very moment he was made.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brow jumped. He shook his head. He gestured towards the corpse of Minting rock, and the few bodies still trapped in it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet, \u8220\'93who amongst them was unready to die?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was clear from the way Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s beard squirmed that there were a great many things he wished to say but did not know how to say them all at once, and such was his passion that they }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 needed}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  to be said all at once or the truth of it would not come through. But Elrahet was able to command his stillness. There was an imbalance here, one which did not lean the way which Mandri expected.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93More will die before the end,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said. \u8220\'93More still, if we continue to dawdle like sundrenched pokes. What\u8217\'92s done is done! Sol\u8217\'92s light, I thought you were a man. Know that the Burshageet breeds while you mourn your dead. \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb, peace broker, stepped forward. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Which way we goin\u8217\'92?\u8221\'94 she asked. \u8220\'93Can\u8217\'92t head straight for the Goree. If the Hrks are onto us, we can\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We make for the Bones of Bullr,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said firmly. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But there\u8217\'92s a Hrkan outpost near there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We make for the Bones!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An\u8217\'92 after that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes flashed fury. She seemed ready to fly up into the dusk and dive upon Seb like a hawk. \u8220\'93Be you a questioning fool, too!?\u8221\'94 She waited for Seb to stumble through a half-cooked excuse, and when none came, her sneer veered into deep disgust so as to exact a sense of shame. \u8220\'93We make for the Bones! Now unlock your weakling knees and WALK!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 With that, she stormed out of Minting Rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arena. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 After that, Moto came by twice, first to hear Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s orders, and a second time to make sure he\u8217\'92d heard them right. When Ayram eventually left to pack up his things, Mandri was left alone. Seb was there too, but high as she was, she wasn\u8217\'92t exactly present. She was listless, chin turned towards the heavens, eyes bouncing between twilight stars, eyes welling with tears.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is something wrong?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Seb said, wet eyes still reflecting the stars.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know her well enough to know what those tears could mean. Even if he did, he didn\u8217\'92t know what to do in these situations.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  The night purples deepened into blues and blacks. The arc in Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck deepened as well. The burgeon she\u8217\'92d sucked was settling her mind into a cosmic cradle. Right as Mandri suspected she\u8217\'92d tipped into some unrecoverable stupor, she said, perhaps to Mandri, perhaps to herself, \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t worry \u8216\'91bout it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Worry about what?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The question snapped a little strength into Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spine. \u8220\'93The Burshageet,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93I can hear ya thinkin\u8217\'92 bout it. It\u8217\'92s why we stole ya. One big ol\u8217\'92 god-swallower. Ya gonna kill it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Am I?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Some heavenly vision strafed Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sight and drew her away. After a few moments of drooling, she licked her lips. \u8220\'93Ya should know,\u8221\'94 she said, \u8220\'93that I know things that I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94 She wiped a tear from her cheek, leaving a dirty smear, and then she trundled off to be alone with that pile of dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri grunted. Those tears were upsetting. And it was a bit presumptuous for her to claim to hear what he was thinking. He hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t put one thought towards this Burshageet thing. Probably, this Burshageet was some fluffed up fantasy which Elrahet wheeled out whenever she wanted to get her way; better listen to her, or else the Burshageet will eat you. It was some sort of demon, a thing no one had ever seen. It might seem strange that the Ayramun should go through all this killing and dying for something no one had ever seen, but that was eminently believable, because the list of things people were willing to die for was quite short, and near the top of that list were things which didn\u8217\'92t exist: promised futures, fantasies, gods, and most of all, fear of an imagined enemy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Besides, if there was such a thing as a great demon, why not leave that business to Hrk? The Lords and their Voices had several Mazidai in supply.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shivered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He sniffed the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That pile of dead was starting to rot. Everywhere he went, there was that stink.}}
