\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A few.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I doubt that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know half the women people call witches are only normal pokes minding their own business. But this one particular woman was not. She came to me the day before I was made a Mazid. In fact, she was the one who recruited me for the job.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Describe her.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, she was taller than Elrahet. Younger, I think, but still old. And you know of Elrahet\u8217\'92s golden knife? This witch had one just like it. Exactly the same. They could well be the same knife.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The venom in Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s accusation took Mandri by surprise, and he looked to the sand hills as if to suggest that the accusation must have come from there because no way it could have come from a living being capable of thought. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He said defensively, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I could be wrong as I don\u8217\'92t recall the meeting perfectly, but the woman was evil. She was a witch. She ripped out my ox\u8217\'92s stomach and swallowed its Spark.\u8221\'94}
