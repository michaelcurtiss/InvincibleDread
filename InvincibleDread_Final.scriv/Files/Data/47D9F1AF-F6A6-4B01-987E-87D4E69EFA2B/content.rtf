When it was gone, Ayram entered the ladder room and used his chisel-head spear to poke at the ceiling, hoping to loose material to open a way out. The first stab of his spear saw a tumble of bricks fall down to the ground, and the second sent a stream of sand pouring into the room. It poured for a worrying while, filling the room with a mound of sand that reached as high as Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s waist, and Mandri\u8217\'92s eyes. A short debate followed over whether to keep poking. Moto feared flooding the entire tunnel system with sand. Ayram ended the argument by stabbing again, and this encouraged a further collapse of stone, and suddenly the dark gave way to a flash of glorious late-morning light.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then Ayram gathered Moteah by the hips and flung her up through the hole. Once outside she climbed up a crater of sand and buried a makeshift wood-pronged anchor under the nearest heavy stone, and attached it to a rope. The rest of them climbed out without much trouble, though Ayram had to go last as everyone else had to help the anchor bite against his weight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When they were all together on the rim of the crater, they faced east towards the storm and reckoned its track. It was obvious that the storm was swerving north-to-northeast, and that meant the best path forward was towards the Goree Pass. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But they would have to move quickly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They departed in much the same fashion as they had arrived, with Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s steady pace carrying her a long way out in front, followed by Ayram and Moto, followed by Mandri hauling Obo. Moteah and Elrahet remained in the rear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The energy of the passing storm still hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t left Mandri. That sandstorm, now darkening the waste in front of him, was the most incredible thing he\u8217\'92d ever experienced while sober. It had him humming old pilgrims tunes about the desert\u8217\'92s beauty. But this sentiment did not last long, for the sun was up, the heat was rising, and the wind was blowing, and as it is in the Sand, when the wind blows, the sand accumulates. Sand attracts sand attracts sand. It sneaks into the shoes, shimmies under the nails, it chokes, and stifles, and narrows the world. And that\u8217\'92s how it was for the vast majority of the journey towards the Goree pass, so Mandri kept his head down and plodded through it. But it was a long journey, and as the Sand knew Mandri was a stranger, it was intent on providing a bit of show-and-tell.}}
