\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 INVINCIBLE DREAD is the first part of a three-part novel of epic fantasy. It is complete at 130,000 words. It combines the brutal desert styling of Cormac McCarthy\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s BLOOD MERIDIAN, with the drug-addled odyssey of Hunter S. Thompson\u8217\'92s FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS, all wrapped up in a spiritually charged fantasy world inspired by ancient Mesopotamia. It follows a disillusioned painter who has fallen in with a troupe of desert bandits who aim to free a god from captivity.}
