He never announced it was time to leave or that everyone should think about heading out, he simply gathered up his enormous backpack and started off.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t notice Ayram walk off because he was engrossed by the colors in the sky, which were darkening into an unusual reddish tint. It was a shade he\u8217\'92d only seen in rotting berries. The whole sky was flush with this startling purplish red, he followed the gradient arc around to the east, and there, suddenly, some hundred yards away, was Ayram\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a giant lumbering towards a featureless horizon. Beyond Ayram was a much smaller black dot named Seb. Seb had set out even earlier after complaining about how slow everyone was and that he was going to do what he wanted to do. Nobody tried to stop him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Elrahet was good and ready to leave, she told Moto to bring the cursed Mazid with him, and she waddled, packless, out into the Sand. Moto turned to Purl and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You heard the woman, bring the Mazid with you,\u8221\'94 and then he jogged off after the others. The clank of iron and wood inside his own heavy pack was his teasing laughter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri waited. When Moteah started out, he got up to follow, but was stopped when Moteah said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are you going? You\u8217\'92re carrying the Mazid.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri moved to gather Obo up, but Purl shooed him away, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wait.\u8221\'94 She wasn\u8217\'92t done staring at the Mazid, who at this point had been gagged by a gray rag. Mandri could hardly guess at what she was trying to do, so instead he sat down on a bump of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s rubble, hands idle, and studied her features.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl fit the standard rule of thumb for beauty that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s taught to artists at an early age\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 don\u8217\'92t make too many marks. People start to look ugly if one makes too many marks to bring out the features. If Mandri were to paint Purl with as few marks as possible, he wouldn\u8217\'92t be lying all that much, for the redding light of the oncoming night was flattening her red, kell-oiled skin. A few soft swoops would capture the sheen of the sky as it defined her high arched cheeks and the youthfulness of her lips, and that was almost it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But if one sits and stares at another human being for long enough, the features of the face start to lose the illusion that they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re working together for a purpose. It doesn\u8217\'92t matter how attractive the person is, they\u8217\'92ve got ugly things about them. It doesn\u8217\'92t matter how many marks one makes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl had ears. Peeking out underneath her sun-licked, frazzled bush of hair were tiny ears. Mandri hated ears, those odd, fleshy protuberances. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s as if, when Solraheen was creating people, He took a wad of clay, crumpled it up, and then slapped it onto the side of the head expecting to come back to it later to make it work but never did.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Everyone has breath\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not quite part of one\u8217\'92s physical appearance, but the breath! If there was ever a sign of what a person is, it is the stench of breath. Cover it up with a swig of acidic pango juice, but that doesn\u8217\'92t last long. Little wonder that in Jeket there\u8217\'92s a whole market square dedicated to tinctures and chews that are supposed to suppress the smell of the curdled things hiding in between the teeth, or pasting the tongue, or tucked into tonsil folds. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But ignore all that.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Get down to the basics.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Study the structure of the face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There is not one person alive whose face is symmetrical. There is always, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 always}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 , some feature which started growing in the wrong direction as a child and kept going with age. Or maybe it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t grow fast enough to keep up with the rest when puberty hit. Titled noses. Slanted jaws. Most common is the uneven eyes, or uneven brows. Sometimes the whole face swivels around to one side, and so one cheek gets slapped more than the other. Or it was smushed that way as the head squeezed out of the womb and it stuck, leaving the mentioned with a lopsided smile.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The only parts of the body Mandri liked to look at were the ones he generally wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t allowed to look at\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a cosmic cruelty, but one he didn\u8217\'92t fret about, because the only reason he liked to look at them was precisely because he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed to. He used to be fascinated by the sparkling eye, but his brush spent so much time nibbling them them that they\u8217\'92d lost their charm. They were nothing but squishy wet orbs squelching around their sockets. And Mandri was certain that if he got close enough to Purl, that if he got a whiff of her breath, so to speak, then the illusion that she was something more than a walking, talking sack of Sparked meat would crumble. And as it is for outer beauty, it\u8217\'92s the same for inner beauty as well. No one is truly attractive so long as Mandri took the time to get to know them.  the time to get to know her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She had no obvious tells.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her hawkish features were tailor made for frowning, which was Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s preference\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a frowning, serious woman. She was even frowning right now. She stood, hands on hips, that timeless pose of the woman waiting for an idiot, and she was frowning.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She was frowning at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh, what?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re carrying the Mazid,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright,\u8221\'94 and then he stood up, and walked over to where Obo was resting. Obo had a gag tied over his mouth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Use the frame.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was a wooden, L-shaped frame fitted with straps sitting next to Obo. It was the same device morning walkers used to haul sacks of grain to work off drought debt. Mandri tied Obo into it. The frame was the perfect size for Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s scrawny back, and it had a waist strap that pulled fast around his stomach, and that kept Obo\u8217\'92s weight resting kindly on top of his hips. He bounced up and down to test its weight, and was delighted to find that his chewed-up leg had made a remarkable recovery.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thought he\u8217\'92d be heavier,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you can carry more...\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, no. No. It\u8217\'92s more than heavy enough.\u8221\'94 Mandri made a show of shifting the weight on his shoulders. Purl\u8217\'92s own pack was a huge, canvas wrapped lump in the shape of a bean, with the head of it looming against the upward puff of her hair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How far is it,\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Bullr basin lies a hundred miles east of here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One hundred miles? That far?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s response was to start walking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri followed after her. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what, ten days?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It depends on Ayram,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93Ten days for him would be slow. Have you ever walked for ten days straight?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He looked to see if they were following one of the old charnel roads. If it was there he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see it, as there was no gentle hump in the earth stretching off into the horizon. It was flat, and even flatter further on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri returned to the subject of Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ugliness\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 her inner ugliness. He hadn\u8217\'92t seen it yet, but was determined to find it out, and an easy way to capture a thing like that was to ambush it. He waited for her to settle into the inertia of the journey, and then pounced.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s wrong with you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Excuse me?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It seems like there\u8217\'92s something wrong with you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She shrugged and moped along, staring at the ground. He wondered if she had been mulling over that very question right before he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d asked it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Too many things,\u8221\'94 she said, and Mandri felt a little shame as she fussed with the tangles in her hair with her one good hand. He\u8217\'92d only been looking for threads to pull and she was about to hand him a ball of yarn.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But what kind of question is that?\u8221\'94 She asked. \u8220\'93You know, it\u8217\'92s a good thing that you\u8217\'92re out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why is that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because the Sand is going to lick your spit until you\u8217\'92re dry.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know what that means.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, you\u8217\'92ll find out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you doing all this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You mean freeing Solraheen?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you want to know, then you need to go and see Him for yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See Solraheen?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve seen Him?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She nodded again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks let you into His chamber?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not exactly,\u8221\'94 she said through sly side-smile. \u8220\'93His chamber is filled with saffee leaf smoke. It\u8217\'92s a bonfire that burns all day and night. Think about how much effort that would take. How many trees you would need.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A lot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks diverted the Ganniket river to make it work. My great-grandfather\u8217\'92s tribe lived on the Ganniket.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry to hear that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks do all this to drug Solraheen so deeply that He won\u8217\'92t see what they\u8217\'92re doing to His creation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So you want Him to end the Hrk?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What Solraheen would want\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what He would command if His mind were not unwound by those fumes\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 is for the Hrkan world to be set }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 right}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 . Only He can do this, so He must be freed.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wouldn\u8217\'92t it make more sense to make sure that\u8217\'92s what Solraheen wants before you do it? I mean, if Solraheen wanted to be freed, He would free Himself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl heaved a tired sigh as if the answer to that question was so perfectly obvious and she couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t bear to explaining it again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And what about Schisol?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He will be destroyed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her pronouncement was as certain as it was insane.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And what makes you so sure it\u8217\'92s going to play out like that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because our cause is righteous.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri thanked the dark because if Purl had seen him smirk she might have punched him right in the nose with her stumpy arm. He gathered his wits and decided to see if he could poke a hole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you think that Solraheen believed His cause was righteous when He buried Himself and Schisol under all that Fabled Black?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen is the most powerful of all the gods who ha ever lived. If His righteous cause ended up more trouble than it was worth, why do you think your righteous cause isn\u8217\'92t going to end up the same way?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re seeing it all wrong,\u8221\'94 she said in a dismissive laugh. She began to explain, as if to a child, intoning her words with charm, \u8220\'93Solraheen\u8217\'92s cause was not finished when He called down the Fabled Black. It was only a link in a causal chain, which ends in us, in the Ayramun. Our cause }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 is }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His cause.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This was how every conversation with a zealot went. Poke a hole in their apocalyptic vision and they cover it up with some trite language play. Soon she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be telling him what he should and shouldn\u8217\'92t do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Am I allowed to leave?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her grin crept wide and she nodded, and her hair brushed up against her bean-bag backpack. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve always been allowed to leave. But you haven\u8217\'92t and you won\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I haven\u8217\'92t had the opportunity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not why,\u8221\'94 she said with confidence. She then stopped walking and pointed off to her right, to an isolated patch of nearby scrub bush. Zooming around the tousled branches was a swarm of pinprick dots. There were so many tiny flies that it looked like the bush had a misty, black aura.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Only Solraheen knows how many hook flies there are,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93Flies can go anywhere\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they can walk along the ground, they can fly in every direction, they can explore the entire world and see sights unseen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but they don\u8217\'92t. They hover in that small, boring spot of air out here in the desert. You know why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked, bracing himself for a bit of folksy outland wisdom.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hook flies swarm like that because even though the world is vast and beautiful, the most interesting thing in it is each other.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl gave Mandri a considerate smile of unquestionable sincerity. Then she resumed her journey, leaving Mandri standing stock still, looking at those stupid flies.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Like most figures of speech, Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s analogy had a surface charm that suggested a deeper truth, but it completely broke down upon further investigation. Those flies weren\u8217\'92t flying around in a ball because of the fulfillment they received from some exciting sense of togetherness. There were more primal interests at play. Maybe they\u8217\'92d found water there in that bush, or food, or the bush broke the breeze making it easier to fly in the first place. Most likely it was about sex. They bunch up into a cloud like that because it is the easiest way to bump their stiff little uglies into something that makes them feel alive. Maybe one could say that still lines up with Purl\u8217\'92s notion of togetherness, but Mandri didn\u8217\'92t get the feeling that\u8217\'92s what she meant. In fact, these Ayramun were the least lascivious group of people he\u8217\'92d ever known\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he\u8217\'92d not seen a single lip-licking wink between any of them, and he had been looking carefully.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She called back to him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t fall behind!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He called back, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have to pee.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl hiked her bean pack further up on her shoulders and continued on. Her pack was so large that it had its own momentum, and she had to move slowly and build up speed until the pack\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s forward motion began to sustain itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The very moment she was out of whisper range, Obo started wiggling around in his seat, and he issued a muffled plea to have his gag removed. Mandri groaned and reached back and slipped the knot keeping Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gag fastened tight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Isn\u8217\'92t she interesting,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not really,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, lying. \u8220\'93What makes you say that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think they\u8217\'92re a death cult.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A death cult?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked, concerned.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bright voice was threaded with excitement as he explained. \u8220\'93They match the pattern\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the way they handled those giant corpses inside of Minting Rock, and the way they gathered up those who fell in battle, Hrk and Ayramun alike, into one big pile. Most would keep them separate.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That pile of bodies was supposed to be a sphere,\u8221\'94 said Mandri as he recalled the back-breaking work he\u8217\'92d done to haul those rocks around.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That fits. Compress them all into a tight ball, for in death all Sparks will be joined together.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Killing everyone would bring peace on earth, wouldn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Suddenly, Mandri had to pee. As he relieved himself, a small brown lizard came crawling out of the sand to lick at the beads of urine that splashed down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But if they want everything to die, then why bring me back to life? Why free Solraheen?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How many Ayramun did they start out with? Fifty?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I believe it was forty-three.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri scanned the horizon\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was wide open space in every direction. There weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t any hills to hide behind, but the shadows behind every bush were dark as Fabled Black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you say to walking off in a different direction?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You may be allowed to leave, but I doubt they\u8217\'92ll be happy if you take me with you. I think the correct decision is to continue on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri wiggled his member and dropped his robe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let it be said that I think this is a bad idea.\u8221\'94}}
