On the earliest maps it was nothing but a nameless black dot sitting halfway down Jandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s western rim. Nobody cared for a small flesh market that merchants skipped on the way down around the horn and east to Jeket.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This all changed when a child slave slipped and fell into a hole. What that girl was doing in the foothills of the Hias mountains, so far from the city, only Solraheen knew. Perhaps it was Solraheen who led her there, for when she was rescued from the earth, she was clutching a nugget of gold.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The shepherd who found her went back to that hole the next day with an oil lamp and a bit of climbing expertise. Twelve feet into it, and his eye caught the glint of a gold stringer slanting sideways through the granite. He followed it through a tight-fitting pocket, and there in that fracture he found a vein of gold that was wider than his arms could stretch. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mines were driven into the hills. No real thought was given to managing the uncountable tons of rock that were pressing down on the blooming network of tunnels. When the people of Meskalim dug into the earth they put up wood beams and packed the walls tight with a stiffening mud, but that was it. They didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t understand that the granite there was fiercely jointed and that a beam supporting one rock might be doing nothing for another just a few inches away. The odd cave-in should have served as a warning. One might be tempted to say these ancient peoples didn\u8217\'92t understand the danger because they were blinded by greed, but the simpler truth was that they were ignorant. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Meskalim became a golden city on the maps of a golden age. Its thousand white domes were enameled with sacred geometry. Its boulevards were filled with all the peoples of the world. Its army was twice the size of any other. Its port was the very center of the earth. All of this because of gold. Gold. Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stone. As bright and as immutable as the divine. Leave it in the dirt for a million years and it will stay as brilliant as the day it was interred. Roll it around in the hands and it provokes a yearning akin to spiritual rapture\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a yearning for more, for as much as one can get. The folk of Meskalim devoted their lives to that call. They followed it wherever it went, even under the city itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then one day a miner slammed his pick into the wrong hairline crack. The waters of the Shalbrum sea flooded in. When the thinned bedrock fell, the golden city above fell with it. More than five hundred thousand people were swallowed up in the slush of earth, though the number grew larger with each retelling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But humans are redoubtable creatures when gold is at hand, so it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t take long for the city to be rebuilt from scratch further south. Meskalim the second swelled anew. This time, whenever a nugget of gold was pulled from the ground it was stored in a warehouse before being shipped across the sea, or down and around to Jeket. Folks feared the earth might open up at any time to eat their treasures, so common sense demanded that the wealth would be better used elsewhere.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And so, for a thousand years, Meskalim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s temple was poor and its people poorer. Its streets weren\u8217\'92t laid out with any sense, much less paved, and these mucky avenues didn\u8217\'92t adhere to the natural contours of the land because when someone wanted to build a house they simply plopped it down wherever inspiration struck. And these houses were ugly things, shouldn\u8217\'92t be called houses\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they were dwellings, crumpled slugs of mud, lumber, and straw with windowless walls all askew. There wasn\u8217\'92t a true roof beam in all the lower city. A horde of these things were smashed up against each other like one big deposit of mud that the Istil wind had, by chance, blown together.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t stand the sight of it unless he was deep in a burgeon binge.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Unfortunately, he had to pace his hooch because he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t afford to be so run through that he couldn\u8217\'92t walk. He had to feather the drink\u8217\'92s effect, take sips every hundred staggered steps or so to keep himself bouncing off that point of no return. It was a dangerous game, taking off the edge in chunks, but it was one he was determined to play to avoid thinking about Pel\u8217\'92s bloody, haunting face. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She was walking right there in front him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her shawl and shoulders were splattered red. She might have drawn a crowd if the streets weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t empty on account of the rain. There were a few farmers muddling about, shouldering clod-mallets and rakes, leading donkeys panniered with half-empty baskets. These men took one look at Pel and darted down alleys that did not lead to where they wanted to go.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri saw his reflection in a puddle, he wondered if it was him they were fleeing. His gaunt face had a wild bearing. And his pupils were blown wide open. The smallest slight of light could get in there, bounce around, and blind him to all the ugliness. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He looked up and was baffled by the gray light of a storm-cloud. He looked back down at the muck welling up between his toes, and every surface sparkled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was raining.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri drank and continued on. As he did, the burgeonsight played with light and wetness. Soon the sparkling bits of light themselves were tangible, like he could get the very essence of light itself glommed up between his fingertips.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 By ways, Pel led him through an empty crossroads, surrounded by some of the blobbiest mud-caked slums in all of Meskalim. The roofs were all topped off with little nipple chimneys, and there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a wooden door in sight\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only rags hanging down to cover their lamplit, onion-smelling interiors. Mandri lingered here for a moment, stooping like an idiot, back hunched, hair drenched, brown robe slipping off his shoulder, for he was struck dumb by the sight of his own hand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He held it up high.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His own skin was sparkling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In the hollow of his palm was a pool of that starry substance. He tried to touch the little sparkles, tried to rub them off, but that was no good because his fingers were sparkling too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t merely wetness, he was sure of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He licked his index finger and a heavenly sensation flooded into his mouth. It was a tingling flavor, impossible to describe. Honeysuckle nectar mixed with the vigor of youth. Apple-juice mixed with god.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He squealed with delight. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He bent down and scraped up a dollop of mud with his finger, then licked it. Again, his mouth was flooded with the flavor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing!?\u8221\'94 Pel screeched as she doubled back to fetch him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see Solraheen\u8217\'92s light!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pel snatched Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hooch-jug out of his hand.  \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve had enough,\u8221\'94 she said, and she threw the blessed beer over one of those nipple chimneys.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Off they went again. They moved as fast as Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s slipping feet could manage. Soon they were at the base of Meskalim\u8217\'92s central hill. This hill towered over the muddy rumps of the city below. Its was studded with white buildings, each clinging to the steep face like barnacles on a washed up corpse. These were the various offices of the local Hrkan government, as well as the mansions of the people who staffed them. The largest building was the residence of Salavan Soreen. All Mandri knew of the man was that, at forty-two, Salavan was one of the youngest Voices in the Lorldly Chamber. His palace claimed a privileged vista at the top of the hill\u8217\'92s southern cliff. Its wide balcony leered over the rest of the city\u8217\'92s mud rumps.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pel stepped behind Mandri and pushed him into a stuttering trot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The hill road was hard trudging. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s legs were completely out of wire by the time he made it all the way up to Salavan\u8217\'92s walls. And what monstrous walls they were. As a rule, Mandri hated walls. These walls were among the most perverse. They were huge, four-men tall, and their only purpose was to stand there and look daunting so that poor Meskalimi didn\u8217\'92t get any ideas. Most walls that big in a place as wet as Meskalim were streaked with black and yellow grime climbing up from the street, but Salavan\u8217\'92s walls were pristine with plaster as white as the day it was slathered on. No doubt Salavan spent more money cleaning that wall than he spent on bread for widows and orphans, or anything for anyone. That wall\u8217\'92s raw materials could buy at least a hundred slaves. Its maintenance, five slaves a year.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 At least this wall was doing a job. Some walls on the lower rungs of Meskalim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hill couldn\u8217\'92t keep out a flying shit. They were purely decorative. Imagine that\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a decorative wall. It wasn\u8217\'92t even trying to fend off the starving masses, all it was doing is letting them know they weren\u8217\'92t wanted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stood in front of the Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall, drooling. The burgeonsight was warping all the little dimples and scratches and faint finger-drags that were imprinted there in the plaster. He couldn\u8217\'92t shake the feeling that the wall was daring him, like a schoolyard bully, to just try it and see what happens.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A ways away, the wall was pocked by a squared arch, and underneath this arch was an ironwood gate guarded by two goons on either side. These men were huddled close to the gate so as to squeeze themselves out of the rain. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t doing them much good. They were as sodden as Mandri. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In the best of light, a hired man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face was an unsettling thing. A lifetime of trading violence for money fixes his expression into a state of permanent concern, and once the brow and cheek get slashed with scars, the whole thing becomes miserable. But blur that face a with a little foggy rain, twist it with burgeonsight, and now he looks like a demon that could bend the bravest spine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And these two demons had swords\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 short, street-wise swords clipped to high-waisted belts.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri knew they couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be full-fledged demons, because such demons should be greasing the feet of backsliding priests, or tricking young beauties into thinking that taking it up the bum doesn\u8217\'92t count.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One of these demons peeked out from under the arch. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 scram, boy!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Git yous butt gawn,\u8221\'94 the other said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri did not know that demons had regional accents. It sounded like this latter demon grew up in a sun-slum near Iskabat. The first demon had no doubt crawled out of a Jeketian gutter, for his lilt and swagger could only have come from someone who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d fought his way out of filth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pel stepped out from behind Mandri, and both demons shrank back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Open the door,\u8221\'94 she snarled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Iskabati bowed and opened the gate\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cutout door. He stepped aside, and so did Pel as she motioned for Mandri to enter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 So, now there was a passage for him to step through.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If there were alternative options, he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see them. Ostensibly, there was an infinite number of possible paths his life could take, and presumably some of these didn\u8217\'92t lead him through that ominous doorway. He could run away, hope to flee back down the hill. Or, he could jump off it and let his body tumble down. He could steal one of those demon\u8217\'92s swords and make a little trouble before getting poked. Perhaps, he could engage his wit and talk his way out. But burgeons had this way of narrowing all life\u8217\'92s possibilities down to the one right in front of his face. This was why burgeons were so despised by so many; they dulled any sense of the future. That led to a stunted life. Mandri would argue that everyone walks through life\u8217\'92s infinite possibilities with their eyes set on a narrow array of options, so if sober people are ignoring an effective infinity, what\u8217\'92s the harm in sipping on burgeons to ignore a couple more?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 At least he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t trying to build walls, those literal embodiments of the restriction of possibility. People who built walls were higher on fear than Mandri had ever been on burgeons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And without really knowing he was doing it, he stepped through the gate.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The door clanged behind him. A shiver ran through his spine. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s amazing how fast he could come to regret a decision he didn\u8217\'92t actually make.}}
