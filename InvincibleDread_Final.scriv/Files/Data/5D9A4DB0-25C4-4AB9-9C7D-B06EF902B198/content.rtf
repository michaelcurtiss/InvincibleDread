\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram leaned motionless on his certainty. It seemed he believed, according to his ornery, side-eyed stare, that if he changed his mind he would risk his command. As Seb and Moto drew him deeper into the argument over what to do, it became clear that he had no intention of actually listening to what anyone had to say. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even listen to himself. One instant he was arguing that their first and only worry was the wrath of Ugmukheen, next he was claiming that it didn\u8217\'92t matter if they died in the storm because the Hrkan pursuit was just as deadly. There were other, sublter self-betrayals, but no one pointed any of these contradictions out because there was a clear and consistent message here: shut up and do what I say. Ayram\u8217\'92s word was flexible, his will was not. In fact, those }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri That kind of flexible inflexibility would have made him a great politician if he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be born to Hrk. The only real difference between Ayram and the average Lord was the sheer size of him. The lords were forced to justify their intransigence by appealing to invincible ignorance; No honest investigation of the truth ever ends, not when infinities are involved, not when every cause-effect pair is but one link in a chain going back to the beginning of time. In the end, all anyone is doing is picking and choosing which facts to isolate as real and self-contained. And in this atmosphere of make-believe, there remains the absurdity of justification. What was Ayram\u8217\'92s? He was bigger than you.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He ended the argument about what to do about the storm by stamping his spear into a rock and splitting it. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This was a man who leaned motionless on his certainty, unmoved by the storm of facts swirling around him. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not that he was deaf and blind to reality. He simply chose to ignore it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had seen in the politicians crawling all over Jeket. In another life, Ayram could have been a great Hrkan Lord, because he was a man who did not need to investigate the truth, because he was a man who knew that such a thing is not possible. We are all invincibly ignorant, and such is the There was no need to investigate, because there is always something to investigate, and he knew that at the end there is a simple choice: which set of facts feel better? The factual foundation of his own sense of self was found a long, long time ago. Which is truer, more useful - that there , or that he was bigger than everyone else.}
