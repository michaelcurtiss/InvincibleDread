Many believe that in fact, axioms are\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 not}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~the real starting points, the real starting points are the abstract objects we really have in mind. So when we say something about integers or arithmetic, we're not saying something about a particular axiomitization, we are actually accessing an abstract concept of numbers in our minds which exist independent of our axioms, and we list axioms as things which we know to be true for certain about those concepts.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 When Euclid came up with his postulates, he wasn't supposing those were the rules of some game with abstract symbols, he thought those really were the statements which were true and could not be denied about the objects (lines, circles) he had in mind. Platonism is, and has been, a dominating view in the philosophy of mathematics, which can be stronger than even what I have said here.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 NJ Wildberger takes a similar view, and believes that there are true and false axioms one could take about certain objects (say, numbers). He really believes that the ordinary numvers you and I think of cannot go on forever, because at some point the number is incomprehensibly large. So the concept of numbers cannot rest on some notion of infinity. He also thinks that the fact that there are paradoxes like supertasks are evidence against infinity being a valid concept.}

This is because if ZF is consistent then so is ZFC (that is, ZF + AC). This was shown by G\u246\'F6del. In fact, he did the following: Working only from the ZF axioms (no Axiom of Choice) he identified the \u8220\'93constructible universe\u8221\'94 L, which is a certain specific collection of sets (L is not a set itself, as it is too large), and he proved that inside L, all axioms of ZFC are true, and actually, there is a definable (and very natural) class well order of all sets. (The sets in L are all \u8220\'93constructed\u8221\'94, and the class well order is basically the order in which they are constructed. The construction takes place along the ordinals.) It follows that in L, AC is not only true (hence also the Banach-Tarski Paraodx), but AC is true in a very concrete manner. For example, working inside L, given any set A of non-empty sets, there is not only a choice function for A, but there is a natural \u8220\'93least\u8221\'94 such choice function for A, and this gives it a concrete definition from the parameter A.
