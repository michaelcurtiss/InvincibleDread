It was quite the accomplishment, keeping those robes dust free. Mandri wondered if they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d developed some secret oil bath which guarded the fabric against the smear of sand, sweat, and dirt. Whatever the formula, it didn\u8217\'92t work on the men themselves, because their faces unraveled when they bore witness to the pilgrim poles\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 half of them cried out, a few vomited, the other half became enraged. There wasn\u8217\'92t one level head among them, save for Pyetle, who was inevitable up on his horse. He barked orders with clean diction, orders assiduously planned for just such an occasion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The men were reorganized into their squares}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A squad of the literate was formed to anatomize the scene.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Messengers were dispatched.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Scouts were ordered to seek water and foraging opportunities for their continued journey.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A return journey,\u8221\'94 was Pyetle\u8217\'92s hope. When Moto suggested that they wouldn\u8217\'92t be going back, implying death, Pyetle laughed. This was to be no different than a recreational hunt. He made that clear as he ordered Ayram to work ahead and give tongue the moment he saw any sign of their quarry. Ayram did not reply. When Pyetle told him to lead on, he did.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a winding canyon.  Once around the fist bend, Ayram scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree. To Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s unworked hands the slope might as well have been a wall of thorns. Moto had to push him up from behind, and Moteah had to pull him from above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Here, Pyetle took pause to consider how to divide his force. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t bring his horse up with him. Then there was the matter of the Riga child. He decided in the end to leave them both behind with a small bevy of men, for their protection. After giving the order he paused to consider the look of doom Elrahet was channeling from above. Such was the scene that the sun was high and behind her, so her stooped figure cast an long, ominous shadow down the length of the slope, ending right at Pyetle\u8217\'92s feet}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is something the matter?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From where Mandri stood on the rocky shelf, he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see Elrahet\u8217\'92s face, but he knew she was sneering because he could feel that a black loathing emanating from behind her cowl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It would be wise to restore the Mazid\u8217\'92s breath,\u8221\'94 Elrahet grumbled, her words rolling down the rocky slope like tremor stones before a quake. \u8220\'93Only Mazidfire can vanquish what awaits us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle, unshaken, ____ and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you think me stupid?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle ____, and he ____. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would never unleash a Mazid. That would defeat the whole purpose of my being here. You won\u8217\'92t convince me otherwise.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come then!\u8221\'94 Elrahet shrieked. \u8220\'93And yes, leave a few strong hands behind. You\u8217\'92ll need them to tender your carcass to the knackers!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet was furious at being refused, but Mandri was even more upset, because watching the Riga be lifted up onto the horse and trotted away was like watching a debt collector trotting off with his harvest. It meant he would have to get used to this hunger for breath. And there was the hunger of speech as well. For starters, he had a few choice words he wanted to share with the soldiers who cursed him as they climbed up the slope.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The first of them, a swarthy man with a twisted nose spat on Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoes and said, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the last bit o\u8217\'92 water you\u8217\'92ll take from me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Others assembled variations on this theme, as apparently Pyetle had driven his men hard for days without stopping to find a well. One man patted down Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robe, looking for a waterskin, working in a forearm shiv to the ribs, but of course, Mandri had nothing to steal. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a crowd of shared suspicion atop that wide shelf of sturdy rock. Here, Mandri and the Ayramun were split apart. Ayram, the spotter, was ordered in front, while Elrahet was kept in back, while the rest were divvied up amongst amongst snickers and insults. Mandri moved amongst the middle, sandwiched between two unwashed loaves of ___, until at length, the way dipped into a narrow crack set into in the northern rock face. The crack\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s opening was hardly wider than the width of Mandri\u8217\'92s shoulders. Somehow, Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step. This was cat-like, lizard-like, bendy-bone movement, feral movement, and the Hrkan soldier nearest Mandri muttered, \u8220\'93Demon!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This drew a click of the tongue from his commander, alongside an order to follow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Everyone squeezed into the chasm, one by one. It was tougher going from then on. If Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t racked with anxiety he might have savored the scene, for the stacked layers of rock on either side were were made from chalky reds all bent into dramatic, sweeping forms. This beauty bracketed a thin, winding strip of blue sky above. There the sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandri as he marched along. Such was the height and swerve of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mush of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Where were they going?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri only cared because the man behind him kept whining about being kept out of the loop.  He _____ as they marched on and on. They marched so long that the oppressive sun had time to cross the streamlet of sky above. Through it all, Mandri consoled himself with the thought of the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon in his pocket. He patted the bulb to make sure the little beauty was still there. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Suddenly, a thumb-finger whistle called from up ahead. The soldier behind called back with acknowledging, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93YEP!\u8221\'94, and he pushed Mandri in back of the head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Git movin\u8217\'92!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hustled to catch up with the fluttering white cloak in front him, and he soon found himself in the bottom of a belled out valley whose slopes bulged with piles of red stone. It seemed as if a great length of the canyon on either side had collapsed. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope, was the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tallest plateau, which stretched beyond vision. Above that plateau was the blazing, latter-day sun. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were blots of soldiers, alongside them was Pyetle, who kept a keen eye on the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re almost there,\u8221\'94 Moteah said upon seeing Mandri\u8217\'92s pained expression.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Almost where?\u8221\'94 the whining soldier asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ll see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From then on, the column was stretched into a trickle of white-cloaks dribbling down rubble strewn paths. As the day progressed, the brilliant blue of the sky dimmed into its deeper hues, and the shadows grew black.  It was then that their path began to lead more steeply upwards, and soon it emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau, though there was still a little ways yet to reach the sky. Some hundred yards away was the start of a dizzying staircase which led up to another massive plateau. Halfway through a tired, silent groan, Mandri realized that the massive plateau in front of him, that monumental knob of rock, was actually a building.}
\par\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shulgi,\u8221\'94 Moteah muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If this was a name, it was ____.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The mountain structure drew up tall, a single curved wall, its rocky skin incised with thin geometric patterns which flared pink in the light of the setting sun. A gradient of pink circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles were joined together to paint abstract faces. There were animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gape. The nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the skull of a mouse. This parade of creation wrapped all the way around the rock like a belt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had never seen the Shulgi\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s like in a painting. All the monumental wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this secluded temple should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered serve well the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crowns, and that\u8217\'92s not even accounting for the effects of the setting sun whose red rays painted the stone with flame.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Lords did not know of it. If they had, they would have conquered it a long time ago. They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have an easier time of it now because the building appeared to be deserted. All the little window holes above the graven faces were as empty of candlelight as the next. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that\u8217\'92s been brushed with the scent of a little lizard lady. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. Pyetle and his men could simply climb up and plant their banner. They certainly looked eager for the task. Pyetle was practically salivating as he began to climb the ancient stairs which would bear him to glory.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But he took his time. There were at least two-hundred stairs, and they were steep. Every step had to be dealt with on its own terms for each step had its own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone. When it was Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s turn, he noticed a dark stain was climbing up the stairs with him. He guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn\u8217\'92t oil, well, it could be any number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a temple that large had to drain out somewhere; odd that they\u8217\'92d have it running out the front door. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But he knew it was blood. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Because of course it was blood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t any people where people were expected to be.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That meant demons, and that meant blood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under the skin. It explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. And that wasn\u8217\'92t the end of it, for on the temple\u8217\'92s wall, all the lines of temple\u8217\'92s faces converged here into a flowing grid which merged into the scales of a half-lizard, half-human face whose open mouth shaped the temple\u8217\'92s entrance. Its fangs were similarly stained by that dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the Greskalun had disappeared because they\u8217\'92d been eaten by the building itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 More explanatory power.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Form up!\u8221\'94 Pyetle barked, his voice a little faint in this thinner air. It was a good place to form up, as this court was a wide, barren table of rock, but his command was premature as a third of his men were still ascending the steep, weathered stairs, their boots scuffing against the smooth stone steps.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bubbling impatience eventually burst, and he shouted, \u8220\'93Where is he!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gaze was fixed on Elrahet, who\u8217\'92d only just come up from the stairs. She looked confused, and when she did not leap to offer an answer, Pyetle shouted again, \u8220\'93Where is the GIANT!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A Hrkan cloak by Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm asked out of turn, \u8220\'93Is he not inside?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s heart skipped a beat as he surveyed the table of bobbing heads. Ayram\u8217\'92s towering frame should have been a black beacon amongst this sea of white cloaks. Moto was here, Moteah too, as well as Seb and Elrahet. Only Ayram was missing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Everyone together peered into the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mouth. Only Pyetle, his back turned to it, seemed convinced that Ayram was somewhere else. He had, after all, been the first to climb the steps and would have seen the giant enter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  he!\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 he demanded again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lips curled into a frown. \u8220\'93I should guess that he lost hope in our cause and fled.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle did not buy it. It was clear, from Elrahet shift into  a smirk, that she didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t expect him to. They traded mistrusting stares while Mandri melted into the feeling of being part of the pressure of a crowd. It was frightening, because there was real sense that if Pyetle\u8217\'92s men might become ungovernable if their commander was to falter. The ragged breathing of the man to Mandri\u8217\'92s left, and the rancid smell of the man to his right suggested that Pyetle had, perhaps, pushed them too far. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 "Where are Tam and the others?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked them. \u8220\'93Who was supposed to be watching him?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A moment of uneasy silence followed, a silence which killed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s estimation of Pyetle. Because what commander would stress the sense of brotherhood in his men? Why would he frame their silence as rebellion? What could he possibly do to save face if no one spoke up? Was this worth it, so far from home, here at the very doorstep of a building whose teeth were drenched in blood?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A little situational awareness would have done Pyetle some good\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 indeed, Mandri could see the realization of the error settling into Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brow, and that was somehow even worse. But he was saved by a shout from nearer the temple.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s someone in there!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle spun around and his anxious disposition faded. He drew his sword as if to do battle with the building itself, and he hurried up to the threshold, but paused underneath the blood-stained fangs to peer inside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bring the pokes!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was grabbed, carried to Pyetle, and dropped with as much care as a rotten plank of wood. The rest of the Ayramun were borne forth in a similar manner, though Elrahet was not touched. She was allowed to hobble along under her own power.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 By the time they had gathered, Pyetle was calmed and had sheathed his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One of you get a torch going.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto unshouldered his pack and quickly found the materials for a torch. He laid out a bundle of dried grass and resin and knapped sparks onto it. Soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air. He applied this flame to his makeshift torch and offered it to Pyetle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re going first.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto shrugged his shoulders, effectively calling Pyetle a coward, though Pyetle did not react. Moto then stood up, walked into the mouth of the beast whose head was the temple entrance, and he thrust the torch into the temple interior.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His face immediately soured.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It smells.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah agreed, all the way from where she stood. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Smells like stale piss.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All piss smells stale,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You would know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get on with it,\u8221\'94 Pyetle commanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the darkness. Pyetle followed with a few of his men. Mandri and the others were forced in behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Shulgi\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a Lord\u8217\'92s barge, thrice as long, and at least four times Mandri\u8217\'92s height. Moto\u8217\'92s torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that was filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had swept some of this ash around the room, with trails of it sprinkling the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing those gathered, was a man sitting cross-legged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto halted and waved his torch back and forth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The man did not move.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hello!\u8221\'94, Moto shouted, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible skin was the whorl at the crown of his skull, fringed by black, ash splattered hair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Probably dead,\u8221\'94 Seb marked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think so?\u8221\'94 said Moto dryly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who said \u8216\'91hello\u8217\'92 to it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle made a grasping motion towards Moto, requesting the torch. Moto acquiesced, and with the torchlight leading the way, Pyetle approached the mysterious figure. The rest of his men began to filter into the room, each with much less surety in their step.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Or bats,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scattered remains of small creatures poked out of every shadow\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 thin boned lizard legs, bats, perhaps mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. It was a general atmosphere of gloom, and Elrahet waddled into it to poke the cross-legged figure with her cane.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The man fell onto his side. His impact kicked up a cloud of ash.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is indeed dead,\u8221\'94 Elrahet declared. \u8220\'93Though he is not a man, or I should say, not wholly a man. He is changed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She bent down and rubbed the dead man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robe between her fingers. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Viggy wool,\u8221\'94 she said confidently. \u8220\'93The raiment of a prince.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A prince!?\u8221\'94 Pyetle exclaimed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Greskal\u8217\'92s son.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is this who who we\u8217\'92ve come to hunt?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. He could have been, but no.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Now that the man was well-and-truly dead, Mandri gained the courage to explore the room. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91inside\u8217\'92\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so many days wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were dead creatures and a dead body? So what if there were demons lurking in the shadows? It felt good to flout these ominous things. If he didn\u8217\'92t, he\u8217\'92d probably faint.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He crept towards the fire-pit but noticed a faint golden glimmer at the back of the room. He walked past Elrahet, past the gawking crowd of soldiers, towards that glimmer, for shining faintly in the torch\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dancing light was an enormous golden statue of Solraheen sitting at the back of the hall.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a rare Old Jandri piece where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a form outlawed by Hrk, for it was sacrilegious to suggest that Solraheen did not dwell in Jeket alone. Here, His golden skin was smooth and His body featureless. His face was round, alive, and enlightened. His pose was rigid as a board, as if sculpted by someone who had never sat before and had the act described. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to reality. It was more primitive, and therefore, more true. And it was huge, at least ten feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a beautiful sight. A source of serenity. None of it glittered as brightly as Mandri might have wanted, for a thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash speckled Him like moles. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. But what could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s golden skin was darkly mottled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tarnished.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri cringed at the impiety. Pure gold cannot tarnish. This meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No wonder Solraheen did not deliver the Greskalun from their suffering.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And worse, standing by Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 jugs of urine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was impossible to say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which could not be ignored. Surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One indignity to wash away another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They should have settled for a smaller statue,\u8221\'94 a nearby soldier said, in tune with Mandri\u8217\'92s own thoughts.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked from the center of the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The soldier pointed to the statue. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a statue of Sol here. It\u8217\'92s tarnished.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What of it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not pure gold.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet tissked at the charge and winced as if it wounded her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol cares not for gold,\u8221\'94 she said sharply. \u8220\'93What He cares about is this man,\u8221\'94 she poked the dead prince again with her cane, \u8220\'93And that poor thing there.\u8221\'94 She pointed towards a dark lump on the floor that wasn\u8217\'92t but ten feet away from Mandri. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That lump had a mop of dark hair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It had a human ear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It had a neck, and attached to this neck were a few links of spine. What flesh there was looked like it had been munched on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shuffled away from it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bastard must\u8217\'92ve been hungry,\u8221\'94 one man joked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It wasn\u8217\'92t hunger,\u8221\'94 Elrahet explained. \u8220\'93It was a deeper urge than that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto was standing over the green robed prince. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This man }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 ate}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  that other man over there?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet nodded. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was his final meal. Thankfully, the struggle which took place in this room is over.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Savored the fools.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Be slow to judge those who fall into Schisol\u8217\'92s shadow. There is no greater struggle. Yes, champion this boy. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it transformed him completely. See here\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She grabbed Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm to force his torch low to the firepit. She poked around the ash with her cane to reveal, half buried, a large round stomach. Evidently the green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it his intestines, and these he\u8217\'92d cut as well and tossed aside. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If he had lost his battle, this world\u8217\'92s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand. We\u8217\'92d have two Amalgametes to hunt instead of one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s an Amalgamete?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His question was met with a grunt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is this not the one responsible for murder of our pilgrims?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Elrahet hissed as she released Pyetle\u8217\'92s arm. She then pulled out her golden knife and cut the stomach open without effort. She used her cane to spread the halves apart, and she leaned over it to divine the future, or perhaps the past, from its contents.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ was subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s the stomach\u8217\'92s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the true meaning of events but predict them altogether. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach again, that he would understand anything, but after a half a finger of silent staring, the stomach squirmed and burped up a black puff of smoke that spread unnaturally quick through the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t take a witch to interpret this sign: Death was alive, and it was near.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Hrkan men were all, their white cloaks here could not protect them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gather yourselves!\u8221\'94 Pyetle shouted.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The only Hrk in the room not wearing a headscarf, made especially notable by his bald head, stepped forward.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Caz, I want you take the men with children, the men with two duties or fewer left. Hunt the giant. He must be in the valley. Kill him where you find him.\u8221\'94 Pyetle paused to assess Elrahet\u8217\'92s demeanor, which did not change. \u8220\'93But first,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93Make sure the others know about this place. Evil grows here and we shall root it out!\u8221\'94 He said this last part loudly, expecting his men to straighten their backs. None did.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He was flat-faced, with wide-set eyes and a bald, gleaming pate. His blank face raised the question as to whether he had any thoughts at all. He even moved like a puppet, strings pulled by Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s commands. And he had a head which could not be painted. Mandri had encountered these every now and again; a head which resisted translation into two dimensions. The man\u8217\'92s chin looked strong from from the front but was rather steep and weak from the side. His nose was practically a wall from the side while from the front, barely there. He gave the impression of having been carved from wood by a middling sculptor who refused to use a reference model. Because young artists were sometimes like that; they believe a work isn\u8217\'92t legitimate unless it springs entirely from the mind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle himself might have been the sculptor. He clearly had the right mindset for it, eager as he was to ignore the more unseemly facts of the world, reducing them down to a set of inconsequentialisms. Pyetle was a man who could paint a scene, or sculpt a human being, and feel absolutely no shame. In fact, that would be a small thing compared to what he was currently doing, which was picking and choosing which of his men would die. His bald, wooden officer helped him decide.}
