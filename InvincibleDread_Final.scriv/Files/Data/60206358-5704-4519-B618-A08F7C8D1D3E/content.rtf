It was quite the accomplishment, keeping those robes dust free. Mandri wondered if they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d developed some secret oil bath which guarded the fabric against the smear of sand and sweat. The men themselves were less resilient. Their faces unraveled when they bore witness to the pilgrim poles. Half of them cried out, a few vomited, the rest became enraged. There wasn\u8217\'92t one level head among them, save for Pyetle, who was inevitable up on his horse. He barked orders with clean diction, orders assiduously planned for such an occasion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The men were reorganized into their squares.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A squad of the literate was formed to anatomize the scene.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Messengers were dispatched.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Scouts were ordered to seek water and foraging opportunities for their continued journey.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A return journey,\u8221\'94 was Pyetle\u8217\'92s hope. When Moto suggested that they wouldn\u8217\'92t be going back, implying their imminent death, Pyetle laughed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We are prepared for a hunt,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93We can manage a demon or two. Or twenty.\u8221\'94 He then ordered Ayram to move ahead and give tongue the moment he saw any sign of their quarry. Ayram assented with a grunt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a winding canyon.  Once around the fist bend, Ayram scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree. Pyetle ordered all to follow. To Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s unworked hands, the slope might as well have been a wall of thorns. Moto had to push him up from behind, and Moteah had to pull him from above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Down below, Pyetle took pause to consider how to divide his force. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t bring his horse up with him. Then there was the matter of the Riga child. He decided in the end to leave them both behind with a small bevy of men, for their protection. After giving the order he paused to consider the look of doom Elrahet was channeling. The sun was high and behind her, so her stooped figure cast an long, ominous shadow down the length of the slope, ending right at Pyetle\u8217\'92s feet}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is something the matter?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quite see Elrahet\u8217\'92s face from where he stood, but he could feel a black loathing emanating from her cowl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It would be wise to bring the Riga.\u8221\'94 Elrahet grumbled, her words rolling down the rocky slope like warning stones. \u8220\'93Wiser still to restore the Mazid\u8217\'92s breath. Only Mazidfire can defeat what awaits us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle smiled back proudly. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you think me stupid?\u8221\'94 he asked. \u8220\'93I would never unleash that Mazid. That would defeat the whole purpose of my being here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come then!\u8221\'94 Elrahet hissed. She flicked her hand at the Hrkan commander. \u8220\'93And do leave strong men behind. You\u8217\'92ll need them to tender your carcass to the knackers.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was sad to see the Riga be lifted up onto Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s horse and trotted away. It was like watching a debt collector making off with half his harvest. It meant he would have to get used to the hunger for breath. And there was the hunger of speech as well. He had a few choice words he wanted to share with the soldiers who cursed at him as they climbed up the slope.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The first of them, a swarthy man with a twisted nose spat on Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the last bit o\u8217\'92 water you\u8217\'92ll take from me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Other Hrks assembled variations on this theme. Apparently Pyetle had driven his men hard for days without stopping to find a well. One man patted down Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robe,looking for a waterskin. When it was clear Mandri had nothing to steal, he worked in an elbow to the ribs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Once everyone had climbed up to this wide shelf of sturdy rock, the Ayramun were split apart. Ayram, the spotter, the wayfinder, was kept in front, while Elrahet was kept in back. The rest were divvied up and lost amongst a white cloud of shared suspicion. Mandri moved somewhere in the middle, sandwiched between two unwashed loaves of man.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 At length, the way dipped into a narrow crack set into in the northern rock face. The crack\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s opening was hardly wider than Mandri\u8217\'92s shoulders. Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step; it was his trademark cat-like, lizard-like, bendy-bone movement, feral movement, and the Hrkan soldier nearest Mandri muttered, \u8220\'93Demon!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This drew a click of the tongue from Pyetle, alongside an order to follow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One by one, they all squeezed into the chasm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was tougher going from then on. If Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t racked with anxiety he might have savored the scene, for the stacked layers of rock on either side were were made from chalky reds bent into dramatic, sweeping forms, with both sides bracketing a thin, winding strip of sky in which the sun was happy to play a game of peekaboo. Such was the height and swerve of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mush of sand and fallen rock that was the floor. And they marched so long that the sun had time to hop the streamlet of sky above and disappear altogether.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri consoled himself with the thought of the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon in his pocket. He patted the bulb to make sure the little beauty was still there. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Git movin\u8217\'92!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hustled to catch up with the fluttering white cloak in front him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He next found himself in the bottom of a belled out valley whose slopes bulged with piles of red sandstone. It seemed as if a great length of the chasm on either side had collapsed. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope, was the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tallest plateau, which stretched beyond vision. Above that plateau was the blazing, latter-day sun. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were blots of soldiers. Among them, Moteah, who kept a keen eye on Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re almost there,\u8221\'94 she said upon seeing Mandri\u8217\'92s pained expression.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Almost where?\u8221\'94 a rather haggard soldier asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah did not answer him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From then on, the Hrkan march was stretched into a trickle of white-cloaks dribbling down rubble strewn paths. As the day progressed, the brilliant blue of the sky dimmed into its deeper hues. The shadows grew black.  It was then that their path began to lead more steeply upwards. Soon it emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau, though there was still a little ways yet to reach the sky.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri next lifted his eyes from the ankle-twisting rocks, he saw, some hundred yards away, the start of a dizzying staircase rising up to another massive plateau. Halfway through a tired, silent groan, he realized that the massive plateau in front of him, that monumental knob of rock, was actually a building. }
\par\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It drew itself up high, exposing a rocky skin incised with thin geometric patterns which flared pink in the light of the setting sun. Such was the hour that the pink gradated into red at at the mountain\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s peak. After Mandri blinked his astonishment, he saw that the patterns, the diamonds, squares, and triangles, were joined together to paint abstract faces. There were animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox\u8217\'92s gape. The nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the skull of a mouse. This parade of creation wrapped all the way around the structure\u8217\'92s like a belt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had never seen the like in a painting. All the monumental wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this isolated temple should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered vitalize the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crown, and that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not even accounting for the effects of the sun\u8217\'92s red rays painting the stone with flame. The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Lords did not know of it. If they had, they would have conquered it a long time ago.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have an easier time of it now because the building appeared to be deserted. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that\u8217\'92s been brushed with the scent of a female. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When it was Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s turn to climb the stairs, he took his time. There were at least two-hundred steps. They were steep and uneven. The wear of ages had them looking like layers of melted wax. And there was a dark stain was climbing up them. Mandri guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn\u8217\'92t oil, well, it could be any number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a temple that large had to drain out somewhere. Odd that they\u8217\'92d have it running out the front door. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But he knew it was blood. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Because of course it was blood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t any people where people were expected to be.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And there was a demon somewhere near.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Blood had explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under his skin. It explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. And that wasn\u8217\'92t the end of it, for the many lines which drew the faces on the temple\u8217\'92s wall converged above the tall, narrow entrance into the mountain, and the point of convergence, the curved entrance arch, was stained by that same dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the Greskalun had disappeared because they\u8217\'92d been eaten by the building itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 More explanatory power.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Form up!\u8221\'94 Pyetle barked, his voice a little weak in this thinner mountain air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Someone grabbed Mandri by the neck and arranged him alongside the Hrkan squares.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When they were all finally gathered atop that barren table of rock, Pyetle began his final review. }{His eyes ticked proudly from face to face, but a sudden realization dawned and his brows quickly drew together. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He stepped back, marched quickly up and down the five-fold squares while his concern gradually turned into panic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is he!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No one answered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle ceased his pacing and revised the question.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is the giant!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stood tip-toe to survey the swarm of bobbing white headscarves. Moto was there. Moteah, too, as well as Seb and Elrahet, all of them spread out like splintered wood amidst the sea of white-cloaks. Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s towering frame should have been a black mast amongst them. He was missing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who was charged with the giant\u8217\'92s keeping?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A man in the first square wavered for a moment, then stepped forward. Anxiety rippled his words.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They appear to be missing.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93WHAT!?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Dars and Fally. They were with the giant. I suggest they\u8217\'92ve gone ahead, ventured into the building.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was the first up the stair,\u8221\'94 Pyetle countered. \u8220\'93I saw no one. They were }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 behind!}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I suggest that\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quiet!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle took a moment to compose himself. He then strode towards the veritable cliff behind him, but promptly dismissed the possibility that the giant had jumped off. His next suspicion fell upon Elrahet. He posted up in front of her and asked, calmly, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is he?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri could not see Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s scowl, but he could watch it work on Pyetle\u8217\'92s round face. The man\u8217\'92s right eye twitched. His full lips curled into a frown. His stiff beard bulged as he bit his tongue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I should guess,\u8221\'94 Elrahet mumbled, \u8220\'93That he fled.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Hrk to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left groaned. A curse reserved for liars was uttered\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 something to do with raking tongues against fish skin. Half the crowd murmured agreement. All this widened the crack in Pyetle\u8217\'92s calm facade, as now his attention was split between a defiant witch and his own insubordinate men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then shout came from the mountain entrance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sir! There }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  someone in here!\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle spun around and hurried up to the threshold. He drew his sword as if to do battle with the mountain itself, then peered inside. After a moment\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s inspection, he shouted, \u8220\'93Fetch the pokes!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was picked up, carried, and dropped at Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet. The rest of the Ayramun were borne forth in a similar manner, save for Elrahet. She was driven towards the entrance arch by the threat of a spear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One of you get a torch going.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto unshouldered his pack and quickly found the materials for a torch. He laid out a bundle of dried grass and resin, then knapped sparks onto it. Soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of the blackest smoke swirling into the air. He applied this flame to a pitch-wrapped stick, and offered it to Pyetle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said. \u8220\'93You are going in first.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto shrugged his shoulders\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 his way of calling Pyetle a coward. He then stood up, walked into the mouth of the mountain, and thrust his torch into its interior.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He immediately spun around and cupped his nose with the crook of his elbow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It smells like stale piss.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All piss smells stale,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You would know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get on with it,\u8221\'94 Pyetle commanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto turned back, held his torch aloft and stepped into the darkness. Pyetle followed, along with a few of his men. Mandri and the others were forced in behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a Lord\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s barge, thrice as long, and at least four times Mandri\u8217\'92s height. Moto\u8217\'92s torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had tossed some of this ash around the room, leaving white trails sprinkled across the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing those gathered, was a man sitting cross-legged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto halted and waved his torch back and forth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The man did not move.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hello!\u8221\'94 Moto shouted, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible skin was his nose which peeked out from behind the fall of his black, ash splattered hair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Probably dead,\u8221\'94 Seb marked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think so?\u8221\'94 said Moto dryly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You the one who said \u8216\'91hello\u8217\'92 to it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle made a grasping motion towards Moto, requesting the torch. Moto acquiesced. With the torchlight leading the way, Pyetle approached the mysterious figure. The rest of his men began to filter into the room, each with much less surety in their step.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Must have living on mice,\u8221\'94 Moto remarked as he kicked a small spine that was lying on the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bats,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scattered remains of all manner of small creatures poked out of every shadow\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 thin boned lizard legs, bats, birds, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This was the den of a beast.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet waddled into it as if right at home.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She stepped up to the cross-legged figure and poked him with her cane.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head slumped onto his shoulder. His hair fell away from his cheek. Elrahet poked again, and he fell onto his side. The thump of his impact kicked up a cloud of ash.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Dead,\u8221\'94 Elrahet declared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She bent down and rubbed the dead man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robe between her fingers. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Viggy wool,\u8221\'94 she said confidently. \u8220\'93The raiment of a prince. Greskal\u8217\'92s son.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle was busy spreading the light of his torch onto several more pitch-strapped sticks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that who who we\u8217\'92ve come to hunt?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Elrahet croaked. \u8220\'93He might have been, but no.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Now that the man was certainly dead, and the room\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s light was multiplied, Mandri gained the courage to explore the room. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be \u8216\'91inside\u8217\'92\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so many days wandering in the wilderness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 So what if there were dead creatures and a dead body?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 So what if there were demons lurking in the shadows?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It felt good to flout these ominous things.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t, he\u8217\'92d probably faint.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He crept towards the fire-pit but noticed a faint golden glimmer at the back of the room. He walked past Elrahet, past the gawking crowd of soldiers, towards that glimmer, for shining faintly in the torch\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dancing light was an enormous golden statue of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was in the rare, Old Jandri style, where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a form outlawed by Hrk, for it was sacrilegious to suggest that Solraheen did not dwell in Jeket alone. Here, His golden skin was smooth and His body featureless. His face was round, alive, and enlightened. His pose was rigid as a board, as if sculpted by someone who had never sat before and was working off the description. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was more primitive, less real, and therefore, more true. And it was huge, at least ten feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, this Solraheen sat out in the open. His seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a beautiful sight. Serenity personified, though none of it glittered as brightly as Mandri might have wanted. A thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash speckled His skin like moles. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. What could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean, warm amber glow, Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s golden skin was darkly mottled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tarnished.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri cringed at the impiety. Pure gold cannot tarnish. This meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No wonder Solraheen did not deliver the Greskalun from their doom.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And worse, standing by Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 jugs of urine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was impossible to say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which could not be ignored. Surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One indignity to wash away another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They should have settled for a smaller statue,\u8221\'94 a creeping soldier said, in tune with Mandri\u8217\'92s own thoughts.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked from the center of the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The soldier pointed to the statue. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a statue of Sol here! It\u8217\'92s tarnished.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What of it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not pure gold.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle tissked at the charge and winced as his man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ignorance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen cares not for gold,\u8221\'94 he said sharply. \u8220\'93What He cares about is this man.\u8221\'94 He nudged the dead prince with his foot. \u8220\'93And that poor one there.\u8221\'94 He pointed towards a dark lump on the floor that wasn\u8217\'92t but ten feet away from Mandri. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That lump had a mop of dark hair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It had a human ear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It had a neck, and attached to that neck were a few links of spine. What mangled flesh there was looked like it had been munched on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shuffled away from it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bastard must\u8217\'92ve been hungry,\u8221\'94 Moto joked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes darted between the green robed prince and the bodiless corpse. \u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t suggest that this man }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 ate}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  that other man over there?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Elrahet interjected with a measure of calm. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Be slow to judge those who fall into Schisol\u8217\'92s shadow,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93There is no greater struggle. This boy was braver than any of you. He fought well against the hunger. See here\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She grabbed Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm to force his torch low to the firepit. She poked around the ash with her cane to reveal, half buried, a large stomach. Evidently the green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it his intestines, which were cut as well and tossed aside. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If he had lost his battle, this world\u8217\'92s woes would be invincible. We\u8217\'92d have two Burshageets to hunt instead of one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Burshageet?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His question was met with a grunt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is this man here not responsible for murder of our pilgrims?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Elrahet hissed as she released Pyetle\u8217\'92s arm. She then pulled her black knife and cut the stomach open without effort. She used her cane to spread the halves apart, and she leaned over it to divine the future, or perhaps the past, from its contents.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ was subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s the stomach\u8217\'92s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the true meaning of events with those folds, but predict them altogether. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach again, that he would understand anything, but after a half a finger of silent staring, the stomach squirmed and burped up a black puff of smoke that spread unnaturally quick throughout the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t take a witch to interpret this sign, for all knew by way of myth what a Spark looked like when it was destroyed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This greatest sacrilege, greater than even the pilgrim poles, gripped the Hrkan men with dread.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Sign of the hrkan star.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You do not know where we are? Are you not Hrkan men? Have you already rewritten your own histories?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This is no temple. It was once a dwelling place, yes, but not of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s own choosing. It was a prison.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Impossible.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not for a choir. Theirs was a single word, broken into one hundred and twenty voices. Each voice entered on the finger, and each new note was added to the chord until the wash of noise did shake the earth. Their word was Solraheen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Sol-rah-heen. The resonance of the room spread His name beyond number. One and twenty became twelve and thousands. It subdued Him, for a time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When He broke, his pure emotion found the mouths of the choir, and inviscerated them with gold. Their Sparks are still here.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It is clear that you are not capable of speaking the truth, so I will not ask again where your giant has run off to. What I want you to know, is that it does not matter. You and your deceit will not overwhelm us. Whatever is here, we will find.  for we are only a finger of a nation, one which which smash these very mountains into the Sand show we go missing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You better hope they bring along a functioning Mazid.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Threat, naked, spears inadequate.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gather up!\u8221\'94 Pyetle shouted, snapping them out of their fascination. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The men obediently gathered into their ranks, squeezing shoulder to shoulder, only allowing spaces for the room\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s columns and the larger corpses which the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pate,\u8221\'94 Pyetle called, and the only Hrk in the room not wearing a headscarf stepped forward.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pate was flat-faced, with wide-set eyes and a bald, gleaming pate, presumably his namesake. His blank face raised the question as to whether or not he was a thinking man. He even moved like a puppet, with strings pulled by Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s considerations. Pate moved to his commander, and Mandri was struck by the sense that the man\u8217\'92s blocky head could not, even in principle, be painted. His chin looked strong from from the front but was rather steep and weak from the side, while his nose was practically a wall from the side but barely there from any other angle. No two-dimensional account of him could be accurate. It was all because his damned blocky skull\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 wide and flat. It gave him the impression of having been sculpted by a middling artist who refused to use a reference model. Young artists were often stubborn that way, believing a work could not be legitimate unless it sprang entirely from the mind. This often resulted in blocky caricatures, like Pate.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle himself might have been Pate\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sculptor. He had the right mindset for it. He was a man who could paint a scene, or sculpt a human being, and feel absolutely no shame about the work\u8217\'92s simplicity. Indeed, digesting reality into a work of art would be a small sin compared to his current endeavor, which was picking and choosing which of his men would die. Pate, his apparent second in command, was helping him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle claimed they were choosing who to send to hunt down Ayram, but everyone understood this was only a pretext to hide a bleaker truth\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 those sent out of the temple would be spared from certain death. Everyone else would venture deeper into Shulgi, down to its stomach perhaps, likely never to return.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pate wanted to cull the cowardly men from their adventuring party\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he pointed out the shifters, the fidgeters, the men too eager for wide-eyed contact, the men who looked too curious. Curiosity was a sign of weakness in the eyes of the Lordship. A dominant man has no need of curiosity, as he knows where he stands, what his duty is. But Pyetle waved all these suggestions away. He opted to release the men with families, as well as the men who were nearing the end of their terms. These men were gathered, dismissed, and in their wake came resentment. If Pyetle had chosen to spare himself, there might have been a rebellion. But to his credit, he stayed, and he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t seemed bothered by the task ahead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I sense resentment,\u8221\'94 he said, addressing them all. \u8220\'93I hear you cursing me. You don\u8217\'92t say it, but I hear you thinking it. But you have it wrong\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 don\u8217\'92t curse me, curse Solraheen! He is the one who put you here, not me. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 He}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  put you here.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Pyetle motioned towards the golden statue which sat at the end of the room. \u8220\'93He guided you, all through your long life, so that you would be standing here. Guided each one of you. You are not unlucky. How can you be unlucky? Get rid of that. You are lucky. Remember that Sol challenges everyone, but few get to meet His challenge with the clarity that you do now. Old men would trade the world the for the chance to go back and do what they were supposed to do when He confronted them. Well, here you are. What are you going to do? Will you march through that dark door, fight His challenge, and kill it? I will. I may die, but I will die with the luxury of knowing exactly what I\u8217\'92ll say to Solraheen when I meet Him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What will you say, Pyetle?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll say send me back! So that I can finish the job!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A hurrah ran through the ranks, and Pyetle encouraged this bright feeling by drawing his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you survive, think of the glory that will meet you in Jeket! Think of your name being nailed to the head of a great demon as children parade it through the streets!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Think of the women!\u8221\'94 Pate shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The women!\u8221\'94 Pyetle repeated to a great swell of cheers. All of them were smiling now as they remembered the ambition behind their oaths. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Onward!\u8221\'94 Pyetle shouted, and he pointed sword towards the dark door set against the side of Solraheen\u8217\'92s seat. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His men repeated his call, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Onward!\u8221\'94, and onwards they went.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri, poor Mandri, was forced to trudge along with these men, these men with excited visions of the afterlife. It was almost like they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d completely forgotten that they\u8217\'92d just seen a Spark dissolve into dust.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Where was that Spark going?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Why would their Sparks fare any better?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The madness of it all was enough to make him smile.}}
