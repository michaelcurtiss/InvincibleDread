\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb hated the waiting that came before an ambush. The future was coming and with it came death or glory, so it was hard not to get excited and make expectations. He dreamed of death and glory. He\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d been anticipating the moment for days. His expectations were built up so high that they\u8217\'92d gone past giddy excitement and had hardened into a sense of impending doom, such that he felt certain he was going to die. He reminded himself that he felt that way during the last ten big ambushes, and yet he came out alive. But there were Ayramun who\u8217\'92d been through it twenty times and died on the twenty first. It was horrible, this feeling. Having to sit with this fear for so long made it worse to be the ambusher than the ambushee. Travelers in the Sand might be expecting to encounter some gang of hard-up outland pokes, but they expected to live through it or they never would have set out in the first place. Death comes as a surprise for them, and their dread is short lived. It wouldn\u8217\'92t be close to what Seb went through. Those people were lucky they died so quickly.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But maybe they weren\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t lucky. It might be true that the only thing that matters is what the mind is like at the exact moment of death, because when the Spark drops out of time, who knows, those last thoughts might be crystallized for all eternity. If one\u8217\'92s last moment is agony then it\u8217\'92s agony forever. For the lucky it's a deep sleep. For folks who get ambushed in the desert, if a sharpened point of iron implants itself in the forehead and scratches the right lobes, that look of shock and surprise gets fixed on the skull and it sets hard as stone. There\u8217\'92s not much comfort in the fact that these terrified expressions eventually get wiped away when some gummy mouthed, flat faced lizard waddles in and chews it up, because by that point the Spark is already good and gone.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If it were true, it could happen to Seb. That was a real worry. This particular ambush was feeling more risky than most. The plan to take out the Mazid and its Minder had to play out exactly as expected, or else all the Ayramun would be killed. If a Mazid were free to run amok amongst them, they would be killed no doubt. A Mazid could wipe out an entire army by itself. And even if they }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 did}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  take the Mazid down cleanly, there\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d be the fifty-to-eighty men of unknown prowess that needed killing. If they were Hrkan Skulsi, that would be too much. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Fifty-to-eighty Skulsi.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Maybe ninety.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There were only forty three Ayramun with fifteen arrows each. Seb\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s rule of thumb was that arrows go roughly three-to-one, misses to hits\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 depending, of course, on the skill of the archer. He didn\u8217\'92t have an aptitude for numbers, but it seemed like there weren\u8217\'92t enough arrows. It would be close, and close was dangerous. And their arrows were a kind of shit\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 the tips were lizard\u8217\'92s teeth reinforcing a hardwood point. The shafts were a strong, close-grain wood, but that made them too stiff. A band doesn\u8217\'92t live long in the desert if they\u8217\'92re always scraping by. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He knew he wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t the only one worried about it all because the rest of the Ayramun were quiet as declawed cats. Even the three lizard brothers who never stopped joking around, they were quiet. Ambushes usually weren\u8217\'92t an exception for them. A gold caravan could be passing right by and they\u8217\'92d find humor in risking everyone\u8217\'92s discovery by tumbling a stone down a rocky slope, or blundering a fart and then claiming later that they couldn\u8217\'92t help it. Even these idiots were keeping low and moving slowly, naught but skinny shadows being whipped to and fro by Moto\u8217\'92s whistled calls though the Junei hills. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was no forgiving horsing around because the rumor was that a Mazid\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes were as good as Moto\u8217\'92s rock crystal lenses, and a Mazid\u8217\'92s ears were as good as a spade-eared bat. That caravan was close enough now that if a Mazid truly was in their midst then his superfine senses would uncover their trap if they weren\u8217\'92t careful. Despite this, when their troupe came to halt in a narrow valley, Seb dared to climb up the slope and sneak a peek over the crest of the hill. He could just pick out the brownish speck of that caravan against the white of the Junei plain.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He was trying to gauge the manpower when Moto hissed a whisper at him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Seb! Get down!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb spun around and there was Moto, staring daggers into him. Seb seethed like a lizard caught unawares, then reluctantly ducked back down into the shadow of the valley slope. Moto was the only one allowed to peek out over the hills and down into the spreading plain. He was the only one allowed because he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d said he was the only one allowed. Ayram had given him that authority and Seb couldn\u8217\'92t argue it. If Ayram were in charge he could maybe wheedle the privilege out of him, but there was no sense in pleading a case to Moto, so Seb slid back down the valley to take up the hiding place that he\u8217\'92d scouted earlier in the day}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a decent valley, long, narrow, and steep-sided, and it bowed to the left, around a lumpy hill, which was good because the hill kept their hiding places out of sight until the last moment. Still, Seb would have preferred springing the ambush in the Junei Pass proper like they usually did. Moto insisted on doing it out in the hills on account of, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91everyone expects to be ambushed inside the pass\u8217\'92. Moto insisted that the best thing to do was to mirror the caravan as they made their way across the plain, then meet them in the hills and attack while their eyes were set on the gap in the mountains.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb appreciated the logic of it\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 work against expectations, but at a certain point the best land for an ambush was the best land for an ambush, didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t matter if they knew it was coming. People worried about ambushes in bottlenecks because bottlenecks were the best place to ambush. A valley like this was no true bottleneck. Compared to the vast expanse of the Junei plain, sure, it would do, but the slopes were nowhere near the height or steepness of a mountain shelf. The Hrks could scramble up them and maybe escape. It\u8217\'92d be like kicking off the top of an ant hill and all of a sudden it\u8217\'92s a free-for-all in all directions. They\u8217\'92d leave the wagons, but wagons weren\u8217\'92t what the Ayramun were after. And if those boys were Hrkan Skulsi, then the last thing he\u8217\'92d want is to do is share a slope with them.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All this was building up a frightful stress. It was even getting to Moto. The man was peering through his lenses, and his searching eye was so bugged out that he looked like he was seeing straight through the stomach of Solraheen. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb was close enough to him to hear him whisper, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Shit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Young Papi, a scrawny, short, and excitable lad with a ratty face, was squatting nearby behind a stone. He heard Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s adumbration too, and he asked the man, \u8220\'93What is it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re changing routes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94 Papi squeaked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We need to move,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re not coming through here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto ducked down from his hilltop sight spot and tucked his lenses back in their bag. He sat for a moment, elbows on knees, a perfect picture of contemplation, then said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They were going to come through here, but now they\u8217\'92re not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They changed directions?\u8221\'94 Papi asked, eyes as wide as the moon.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t answer. He was back to brooding.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Papi said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93If they changed direction, then you think they know we\u8217\'92re here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We need to move,\u8221\'94 Moto repeated as he looked over his shoulder. \u8220\'93We need to hop over a few hills.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Big Dill\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s bald, blue-eyed, jug-eared head popped out from behind a boulder to share his opinion on the matter. \u8220\'93We can\u8217\'92t move now!\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93The Mazid will see us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We can move if we\u8217\'92re careful,\u8221\'94 Moto replied. He flicked his hand in the air as if Dill\u8217\'92s opinion were a fly. \u8220\'93The caravan is still a ways out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Dill\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s upper lip curled. This wasn\u8217\'92t a natural facial tick, it was something he did because he thought that flashing his teeth made him look fierce. He said, sharply, \u8220\'93If you can see the Mazid, the Mazid can see you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Papi said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We should wait for Elrahet\u8217\'92s smoke.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The rest of the forty Ayramun were scattered about on either side of the narrow valley, and every one of them was staring up at three men. They couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t hear what was being said, but over the years they\u8217\'92d learned to read body language from afar. Moto was doing a decent job feigning calm, but Papi and Dill\u8217\'92s pained expressions told everyone everything they needed to know. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto picked up his unstrung recurve bow and crawled back up the hilltop.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Papi\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 Seb called after him. \u8220\'93We should wait for the fog to move.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Damn waiting for that witch!\u8221\'94 Moto cried. \u8220\'93If her shits not here by now, it\u8217\'92s not coming. We need to move.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What about Ayram?\u8221\'94 Papi asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah,\u8221\'94 said Dill. \u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s Ayram?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Let Ayram worry about Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From across the valley, Skitter whistled to grab everyone\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s attention. Once their gazes were in hand, she pointed up to the Hias mountains behind. There, drifting out of the dark belly of the Junei Pass, was a gray, wispy mist. It was hardly noticeable, but all the same it was there and it was pouring down into the hills, growing thicker by the moment. Elrahet\u8217\'92s magic was coming.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The snooty look in Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes evaporated. He beckoned Seb up to him, and Seb scurried close. Moto whispered, \u8220\'93That damned fog is going to make it impossible to mirror that caravan. I\u8217\'92m going to get down to the plain to make sure I know exactly which path through the hills they\u8217\'92re taking. I\u8217\'92m putting you in charge until I get back.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb nodded. Dill overheard and was less enthused. He left his boulder and squat-walked over. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t do that,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Only Ayram can put someone in charge.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t care who\u8217\'92s in charge,\u8221\'94 Moto said scornfully. \u8220\'93Just don\u8217\'92t leave this valley. Don\u8217\'92t even think about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t anything in Moto\u8217\'92s words for Dill to argue with, though the wild look in his eyes and the veins spidering out of his shaven skull said he was trying to find it. Dill was a man who was always defending his place in the pecking order. The list of men who could give him short shrift was, itself, short\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 there was Ayram of course, and then barely Moto. No women. Moteah could probably take him if she wanted to try, but Dill would never admit it. He had a hard enough time admitting that he\u8217\'92d lose a brawl to Ayram. He\u8217\'92d have to be dead sober, and even then it\u8217\'92d be all, \u8216\'91you never know\u8217\'92, and \u8216\'91if things happened like so-and-so\u8217\'92, and \u8216\'91if I were proper mad I could kill anything\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Dill\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s hateful eye chased Moto as the man scuttled down the valley slope. At the bottom Moto dusted off his burnt orange robes and then did a glancing head count to make sure all the Ayramun were where they needed to be. He broke his own law of silence by saying out loud, \u8220\'93Alright, you idiots\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 sit tight, I\u8217\'92ll be back soon.\u8221\'94 Then he turned around and disappeared around the valley bend. He was gone in less time than it took Seb to fish another borcandi spine out his sleeve.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb was chewing through his spines at a prodigious rate. Moto leaving only made the stress worse. It was never good for discipline when a leader leaves the group, even a much begrudged deputy leader like Moto. Without a man to lead Seb knew it was only a matter of time before someone got a bright idea that needed taming. Seb figured Dill would be the first to act up, because that\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s just who he was. When Dill rambled back down to his boulder he was muttering insults and curses at no one in particular.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Loosen up, Dill\u8221\'94, said Forty. Forty was an older woman with a rascal\u8217\'92s disposition. She playfully twanged her bow at Dill\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 a mocking shot at his self-importance. Dill sized up this affront with a puffed-out chest, and said, \u8220\'93Big show. Biiiiig show. But you better be careful, Shorty, \u8216\'91cause anything can happen in an ambush. With this mist rolling in, I might not know which way I\u8217\'92m shooting.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Same goes for me,\u8221\'94 said Forty, tongue only half-in-cheek.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pipe down, Sol\u8217\'92s sake,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty gave Dill one final fleer, then the two marched apart and settled down to watch Elrahet\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s mist bleed out of the mountains. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The humidity had already reached them\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 Seb could smell the pleasant musk of moistened earth. And up in the mountains, the mist was no longer merely a mist, congealing as it was into ropes of fog, fog magic\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d with purpose, spooling out into slender smoky tendrils that slithered down into the hills like snakes. Some of them twirled up into the darkening sky and there the wind caught them, lifted them higher, brushing out the finer threads. A low, rolling drum of distant thunder echoed out from somewhere deep inside the mountains.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Fair play to Elrahet,\u8221\'94 Papi said. Seb agreed. This was shaping up to be Elrahet\u8217\'92s finest bit of belly magic. It was, perhaps, too good. If he could see it, then no doubt a Mazid could see it too. What a Mazid would make of it, he could only guess, and just as it was all starting to coalesce into something resembling a natural, smooth fog, a misty fissure snapped into the sky over the mountain peaks, and from it a herd of storm clouds emerged. They crept out slowly, hesitantly, like cautious cattle out of the pen, but once they were out they began to billow as they fed on the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of Elrahet\u8217\'92s den.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Two fingers later and these storm clouds were blotting out the sun. Their gray shadows drooped down over the Ayramun\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s valley, and not long after that the drifting fog mantled the nearest hill and fell upon them. Visibility dropped so low that Seb\u8217\'92s near-sightedness was no longer an impairment, for no one else could see further than he. They all watched the valley bend even though it was out of sight, for they all expected that at any moment, Moto would come jogging back to get them moving again.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then it began to rain.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a sprinkling shower at first, little pricklings on the skin, a light peppering of the sandy rock and clay. This didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t last long, for the raindrops swelled and in half-a-hand they were no longer prickling but plunking. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93A bit much, isn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94 Papi said as he sheltered his bow with his short brown cape. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t she know I can\u8217\'92t shoot no good in the rain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92ll stop soon,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But it didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The rain dribbled off the rocks and stony clay, and where there were depressions and scars in the earth the rain was pitter-pattering puddles into being. These puddles grew into boot-swelling pools that overflowed their banks, and streams poured down the valley slopes, following the run of furrows that ancient rains had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millennia. Seb figured it was more water in one short span than this stretch of desert had seen in twenty decades. It brought out the lizards\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 or rather pushed them out. A little gray bonbon popped out of the clay right next to Seb\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s boot. Its swiveling eye looked mightily confused by the sudden downpour. It was so flustered that it didn\u8217\'92t have time to notice Seb\u8217\'92s heel coming down on it\u8217\'92s head. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb looked over to young Papi. The boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Might as well be swimming,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Damn this goddamn rain!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The curse was hardly out his lips when a gnarled flash of white lightning split through the iron mist above.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 CRACK-BOOM!}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A chorus of startled yelps echoed out from the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Papi looked like he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d shat himself. \u8220\'93Elrahet\u8217\'92s never conjured more than a mist!\u8221\'94 he squealed.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mizm, a gray-scruffed old-timer stationed across the valley grumbled out, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That old witch is gonna get us killed!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s Moto?\u8221\'94 came another ragged voice out of the rain.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Screw that,\u8221\'94 said another. \u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s Ayram?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From there the Ayramun began to bicker. The specific charges and insults being thrown across the valley weren\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t anything new, but the stress and fear had so softened everyone up that the simplest \u8216\'91eat my shit\u8217\'92 cut deep. If it weren\u8217\'92t for the rain dampening their fighting spirit, there might have been a brawl.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t begrudge them their bellyaches. They\u8217\'92d been fed a raw meal. None of them were prepared for this kind of weather. The ground under his butt was getting slick and muddy, and if it rained any harder it would be difficult to shoot a bow because the wetter his bowstring got, the more it lost its spring. And there was no telling what a pounding rain would do to an arrow\u8217\'92s flight because Seb had never shot in such conditions. He knew enough to know that it wouldn\u8217\'92t help. For an ambush where everything had to go right, this was downright bad.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb began to brood and boil, but he caught himself in the act\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 he was torturing himself with expectations.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He needed to recenter himself.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Things weren\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t bad. They weren\u8217\'92t good, either, but they weren\u8217\'92t bad.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This kind of thinking, this breaking the world into \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91good\u8217\'92 and \u8216\'91bad\u8217\'92, this was a symptom of expectations.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The truth was that everything was happening exactly as it was supposed to happen.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb closed his eyes and thumbed a short chain of prayer beads that he kept stashed in his robe, and as he did, he chanted a prayer to try and repress his simmering frustration.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \tab }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 A well without water is filled with purpose,}

\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He repeated this five, ten times as he drew his shoulders in against the rain. This plunking rain. This purpose-driven rain. The fog, the bickering, these were purposeful too\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 to what end, Seb wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t sure, but now that he was looking for purpose he could sense a great deal of it, and perhaps it was brewing something terrible. The Ayramun were about to intersect with destiny\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 no\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 that was wrong to say, for destiny is ever-present. They were always intersecting with it. There were no bit-part players here. Poor and ragged as they may seem, these Ayramun were people, and all peoples are descendants of the first man and first woman, each soggy, grumpy face was the culmination of a hundred thousand generations of toil, as many generations as the Hrkan Lords themselves, and so each were as important, as godlike, for if but one of them was missing then events would not unfold as they were meant to. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But he shouldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t privilege the living. If the rock under his feet did not exist then he would not be sitting here, he would be sitting somewhere else, and thus the future, bounded by lines of immanence extending from the present, would wind a different weave. Yes, this very rock was sacred, as all things are sacred, as the dead lizard under his boot was sacred. All things are filled with the Spark\u8217\'92s sacred power.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The call had come from Dill. He and a few other miserable looking louts were down on the valley floor, straddling either side of a trickling stream that was building up in the middle of the valley\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s run. Seb was about to chastise them for doing Sol-knows-what when he noticed that Moto had returned and was standing in their midst. Seb leapt to his feet and filtered down the valley slope with the rest of the Ayramun. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Down in the valley\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s belly, Moto face was alight with an excitement that no one shared.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s wrong with you people?\u8221\'94 he asked. \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re about to bag us a Mazid and you look mad about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tizm, the old bent-backed wonder, kicked at the swelling stream and pointed to the sky and shouted, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The old witch has overcooked it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A refrain of agreement rained down. A few shushed, then others shushed back. Moto tried to calm them all with plaintive hands, saying, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93People. Please.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Please my ass!\u8221\'94 said Tizm. \u8220\'93This rain is gonna ruin everything!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The rain is perfect,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s got the Hrks hunkered down in a valley finger.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks?\u8221\'94 asked Papi.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 said Moto with a wary grin. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s Hrks we\u8217\'92re hunting. Hrkan Skulsi.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The admission that it was Skulsi, not Blackwood caravan men, sent a wave of discontent rippling through the gathered Ayramun. Moto tried to stem the unease by lying. Seb knew it was a lie because when Moto was working through a big lie he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d smile and whine at the same damn time, like people\u8217\'92s doubting faces were annoying to him. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92ve gone and lined themselves up against a wall for us,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Jumping them will be the easiest thing in the world, but we\u8217\'92ve got to hurry.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Someone on the outer edge of the huddle blurted out, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s this about Hrks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto raised his voice above the rain. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The Minder and his Mazid didn\u8217\'92t come with a Blackwood caravan. They came with a Hrkan guard.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Another round of shouting broke out, followed by another round of shushing and counter-shushing. Moto again tried to calm those gathered with nothing but his frantic hands. In the end he resorted to a sharp whistle, which shut everyone right up.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The fact that it\u8217\'92s Hrks doesn\u8217\'92t change a damned thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Dill\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s bald head stuck up above the huddle like a veiny, boiled egg floating in a stew. He spoke up and said, \u8220\'93All the better! I\u8217\'92d rather kill a Hrk than a Jandri man!\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto nodded and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re bedded down like rabbits in a long, straight ravine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The one with all the karkle bushes?\u8221\'94 Seb asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92ve all got karkle bushes in them,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The valley we\u8217\'92re standing in don\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It doesn\u8217\'92t matter,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93All we have to do is sneak up and shoot some Hrks. It\u8217\'92ll be the easiest thing in the world. I know it\u8217\'92s raining hard, but I\u8217\'92m not asking you to feather a Hrk at ten-score yards. With this rain and fog we can get up close. You won\u8217\'92t miss. You can throw stones at them if you want to. You can stuff mud down their throats if you want to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s Ayram?\u8221\'94 asked another.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  A quiver of frustration flashed in Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s face and he shot a quick, beseeching look to the heavens before saying, \u8220\'93This is happening whether he\u8217\'92s here or not, whether you like it or not. And it\u8217\'92s happening }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 now,}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  before this rain and fog let up. Let\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s get moving!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He turned and pushed his way past a few Ayramun and set off back towards the bend. After the briefest hesitation, Big Dill marched after him, and at his encouragement, everyone else followed. Together they were a small, sad herd of outland folk, a jumble of soggy wool and tired feet slapping the mud aside the building stream.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb kept to the back as they eventually climbed up and out of the valley and then crossed over a few others. They tramped through a flooding basin, and all the while Seb eyed the rainy mist with unease, for he could feel providence at work in that mist. Unlike the providence that people pray for and expect, this providence was providing something undesired, Seb was sure of that. Destructidence is what it was. Deathidence. There wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t an established word for it, which itself was a telling sign of the plundering spirit of the age. People only cared about their relationship to the gods so long as they were getting something good out of it. These Ayramun were no different.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Eventually Gugi found his way to Seb at the back of the wandering troupe. The skinny man\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s face was agog with fear. He clearly wanted to talk, so Seb indulged him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Whaddya want?\u8221\'94 Seb asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Ya know where we headed, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s that cursed ravine, the one where I found that dead body.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You should say somethin\u8217\'92 to the others.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Why not you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t ever say shit so no one\u8217\'92s gonna listen to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They won\u8217\'92t listen to me either.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They would. I would. That ravine is cursed, and people are gonna die if we get down in it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you said if we moved that body out of that ravine, then the curse would be moved out with it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What do I know about curses? I was just sayin\u8217\'92 shit. For all I know that curse is what brought this storm and lured them Hrks down in it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Are you tryin\u8217\'92 to get out of payin\u8217\'92 me my spines?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Gugi spat a wad of borcandi juice right where Seb was stepping, clearly upset that Seb could think about debts in a time like this. Before he could voice that concern, a muted horse\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s whinny was heard through the splashing rain. Everyone instinctively crouched down and rushed to the shelter of a sloping mound. They were still a few-score yards away from the ravine where the Hrks were sheltering. Nothing of those troops could be seen through the mist.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto raced back down the line of the Ayramun to crouch down next to Seb and Gugi. Voice low, he asked, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You two scouted this ravine, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Gugi and Seb both nodded.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Anything we should know about it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Gugi was quick to respond. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s cursed and we shouldn\u8217\'92t be here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Cursed? What do you mean, cursed?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93This be the ravine where we found that dead body.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto snorted, almost laughed, then said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I need to know the lay of the land. I can\u8217\'92t see through this damned mist so I don\u8217\'92t know if there\u8217\'92s an easy out for them up on the eastern side.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Moto,\u8221\'94 said Gugi, leaning into his words, \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m tellin\u8217\'92 you, this place is cursed. It\u8217\'92s gonna get us killed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93So what? If it\u8217\'92s cursed for us, it\u8217\'92s cursed for them too. Doubly so for them, cause they\u8217\'92re sitting in it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, but we the ones who found the body! We the ones that been warned! Not them. Us\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 Me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto gave up on Gugi and turned to Seb. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Is there any way in and out of that long stretch that might make it easy for them?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb shook his head. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That stretch is mostly steep. There is one little nook on the other side that\u8217\'92s kinda like a stair but that\u8217\'92s it.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How wide?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Not that wide.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto paused to think, then said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I want you two to go back a ways, and cross to the other side of the ravine where it\u8217\'92s safe. Then work your way back down the other side and then set up where that stair is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Just us two?\u8221\'94 Gugi asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto looked her square in the eyes, turned and motioned towards his sister, Moteah, who was not at all enthused to be at her brother\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s beck and call. Like Moto, she carried herself with an air of authority, though she was even more arrogant about it than her upfront brother.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto looked her square in the eyes, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Get Dill and twelve others to follow Seb and Gugi. You\u8217\'92re going to set up on the other side of the ravine, and we\u8217\'92re going to try and push the Hrks towards you. So be quick and be ready. There won\u8217\'92t be a whistle. When they come, they come.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah snuck away, gathered up Dill and the nearest twelve Ayramun, then brought them to Seb and Gugi. Gugi wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t about to take charge, so Seb crowned himself and led them all back towards the mountains, keeping the course of the cursed ravine a few-score yards away to his right. When he felt they\u8217\'92d gone far enough, he led them sliding down into the steep ravine, and then they had a tough, nervy scramble back up the other side. Steep as it was they had to help each other up, and once up they headed back towards the plain, keeping low and quiet.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb knew what features he was looking for, but with the rain and mist there was no way he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d find the spot until he was already upon it. The fog was so thick that he kept second guessing whether he was following the right ravine. Nonetheless he kept going, one foot in front of the other, trying not to think too much about the fight that was only fingers away. Soon, he was confronted with the sound of snorting wagon ponies drinking their fill of rainwater.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb crouched down, and the rest Ayramun behind him did likewise. He ambled over to the edge of the ravine and slithered up against a big, solid boulder that leaned over the ravine\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s lip. From there he could hear horse hooves stamping in the ravine\u8217\'92s stream. If a horse was that close, then a Hrk might be closer. He didn\u8217\'92t want to peek over the boulder to get the lay of the scene, but when he heard the clank of wood on wood he couldn\u8217\'92t help himself. He steeled his nerves and peered over the boulder and down into the ravine.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Right below him were two horses still hitched to an empty wagon, and behind them were two more horses and another empty wagon, and whatever was behind them was lost to the mist. There was only one man. He was a natural Hrk, so far as Seb could tell, a natural Hrk with redblack hair and a full black beard that made his head seem massive. Clad in sopping wet browns, he was darting to and fro amongst the wagons, prepping them against the rain with all the urgency of a man who knew the curse that water puts on a wagon that\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s been drawing dry. It swells the wheels when they\u8217\'92re already squeezed tight by the thin, shrunk-on iron tire. When rain moves on and the wheel dries out it starts to crack and up sprouts gaps. Sand gets into the wax-greased innards of the hubs and grinds against bronze bushings. Prophylactic measures must be taken, and taken as fast as possible. Seb was surprised to see only one man making an issue out of it. He was driving himself insane as he scampered through the rain and fumbled with the wheel tents that were ready-tied to the sides of the wagon bed. The beds themselves looked empty.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Where were all the others?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb turned to his troupe behind him, and the confusion on his face must have been easy to read because Dill grumbled and invited himself up to Seb\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s rock. The man kept his vein-strapped head tucked against the rock\u8217\'92s hump as he peered out around it.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Upon seeing the wagons and the lonesome Hrk, Dill\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s confusion surpassed Seb\u8217\'92s. His eyes searched for some sign of the rest of the enemy, but found none.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Shit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah joined the two men at the boulder and quietly stole a look for herself. Her usually uptight expression didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t show the slightest hint of concern.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s goin\u8217\'92 on?\u8221\'94 Dill asked her in a whisper.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Why would I know?\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Your brother\u8217\'92s the one who went scouting.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Do I look like Moto to you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, you do,\u8221\'94 said Dill. \u8220\'93If he sprouted tits I couldn\u8217\'92t tell you two apart.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s brow tightened even further. It wasn\u8217\'92t anger. Seb called it \u8216\'91severe disinterest\u8217\'92. It was one of Moteah\u8217\'92s two expressions, the other being plain old disinterest. Problem was, that look wasn\u8217\'92t a good way to deal with a man like Dill. The best thing to do was to pretend not to notice him, even ignore him altogether. Unfortunately for Moteah, she was too pretty to get away with ignoring a man like Dill. To a man like Dill, her wrinkled brow was nothing but shirred meat, meant nothing other than what it was.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Bitch is leadin\u8217\'92 us into a trap,\u8221\'94 he whispered to the others.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not leading anyone anywhere. Seb is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb felt the eyes of both these schemers bear down upon him. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t lookit me,\u8221\'94 he whispered back. \u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t set this up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They were still looking at him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb pointed east, in the direction of the Junei Plain, and whispered, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a overhang in the ravine down a ways. It could do as a cave. It could be that the Hrks have taken it up.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, you\u8217\'92re a soilbucket.\u8221\'94 Dill\u8217\'92s voice was uncomfortably loud. \u8220\'93This is a goddamned trap if I ever seen one. I bet my nuts they know we\u8217\'92re here.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Dill turned to the iron mist from whence they\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d came, and he cast his suspicious eye about, as if the dark boulders lurking in the haze were really Hrkan Skulsi in disguise. He unwrapped his bow from its cow-leather strap and strung it with an easy flick. The rest of the Ayramun caught on to his excitement, and they strung their bows in kind. Then they all thirteen of them, Gugi included, crept up to join Seb, Moteah, and Dill at the lip of the ravine. When their fists were full of arrows, Dill decided for himself that the time was right to strike. He gave his bow a pull to test the string, and then he stood up and loosed an arrow at the unaware Hrkan wainwright.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The arrow didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t have far to go. Almost as soon as the fletching was free from Dill\u8217\'92s fingers the arrowhead was planting itself into the back of that Hrkan neck. The man clutched and gurgled, then fell to his knees and splashed down face-first into the budding rainwater stream. His head was buried full in the running water, and downstream one of the horses whinnied and stamped when it found its drink suddenly awash with blood.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Dill ducked back behind the boulder and gave Seb a contented grin, like he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d just won the battle all by himself. Then they waited. Moto had said there would be a whistle, so they just had to wait for the Hrks to come. It was unbearable. They waited for at least a full finger, and by then the rain started to let up and the sound of the ravine\u8217\'92s running water in the ravine was louder than the plunks which poured from the sky.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Dill moved from behind the boulder and made to climb down into the ravine.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb caught the hem of his robe and pulled him back.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing?\u8221\'94 Seb rasped.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no one here,\u8221\'94 said Dill calmly.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Moto said we should wait!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Dill stretched his arms out to gesture at all the nothingness down in the ravine. He said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Wait for what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93A signal.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Signal to do what? What are we ambushing, the horses?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One of the Ayramun, a young one named Ritt, popped his head up and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s Hrks down there somewhere, I feel it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Quiet down!\u8221\'94 Moteah snipped.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Much to Moteah\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s dismay, and Seb\u8217\'92s amazement, Dill stood straight up and put his finger and his thumb to his lips and whistled out a three-chirp alarm\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 bright and sharp. The sound cut through the falling sheet of misty rain as easily as if it weren\u8217\'92t there at all. The horse\u8217\'92s ears swiveled as they regarded Dill with some confusion.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Before anyone could do anything, Dill scrambled down to the bottom of the ravine, arrow knocked, and waited for something to happen. When nothing did, he growled a curse and shot an arrow into the back of the already dead Hrk. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not stayin\u8217\'92 here no longer,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 With that, Dill marched across the ravine and tossed his bow up onto the other side and started to climb out.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah swept up in Seb\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s periphery and shot an arrow right at him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In clean dry air a gull-feather arrow with a whistling nock would trill with excitement when released, but soggy as it was, Moteah\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s arrow flew across the ravine without so much as a whine. Dill had no idea what hit him, and it hit him in the back, right inside the left shoulder blade and continued on through the heart. He fell backwards into the ravine and was limp dead before he hit the ground.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb gasped. It was against the rules to even scratch one of their own, even a throbbing cock like Dill. Killing an Ayramun was a privilege reserved for Ayram. But before he could get out a word, Moteah grabbed him by the breast of his robe and yanked him down behind the boulder.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb twisted her hand off him and held it firm in his wiry grip.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92d ya kill him for!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah put her finger to her lips and shushed him. Seb grimaced then spat the whole borcandi blob that had been stewing in his cheek. He spat it right at Moteah\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s face. Moteah ducked out of its terrifying arc, quick as a cat, and the wad landed with a splat on Gugi\u8217\'92s chest. Gugi squealed in disgust as he flicked the gooey gunk away. Moteah clapped his mouth shut with her free hand and her eyes flared caution at both men. She pointed with her chin to the opposite bank and mouthed a silent warning\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 Hrks.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb let go of her wrist and peered around the boulder. There across the ravine were two shawled figures wandering out of the mist. At first he took them for Ayramun, but the first of them made a foreign gesture towards the other, and when Seb saw a flash of white under one of their ruddy cloaks he knew for sure\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 these were Hrkan men. Then the two figures paused, cocked their heads towards Seb like they\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d felt his thoughts ripple the fog between them, and they dropped down flat against the ground.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb ducked fast behind his boulder. He turned to Moteah and had to restrain himself from shouting. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They know!\u8221\'94 he whispered.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The sound was hardly out his mouth when from behind them, on their own cozy side of the ravine, a Hrkan horn of war thrilled the air.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommmm}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Hrkan battle horns are deep and drooping bleats that tremble the bones of even the most well armored lizards, and Seb was clad in nothing but rags. When the horn blast jumped up behind him it startled him out of his skin. He yelped and swore and swiveled around to face the terror, and there, deep in the fog, running right towards him, was a blurry host of men, Hrkan Skulsi, white coats flashing bright under their brown disguises. Maybe twenty or more of them. To Seb\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s near-sighted eyes they were a leggy, white speckled blob moving along in silence, all business, just jogging right up like they were lost and about to ask for the way to the road. They didn\u8217\'92t even try to intimidate with screams and yells, for in truth they were killers, not soldiers. The power of the Mazidai had long made armies obsolete, so the kind of professional fighting man that the Hrkan world breeds is one who lusts for the frenzy of small skirmishes where it's man against man.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The horn bleated again.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 BWEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooommmm}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Skulsi blob began to sprint. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb felt a strange warmth running down his thigh and he realized that he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d pissed himself. Moteah loosed an arrow at the running blob and before she saw the results, she took off sprinting west, back up along the ravine and towards the mountain. Seb took off after her, and the rest of the Ayramun followed. They trimmed the ravine, pursued by that mob of Hrks, while on the opposite bank those two Hkran cloaks had somehow multiplied into twenty. They shadowed the Ayramun, silent like the others, and they bunched up against the ravine as they waited for the terrain to present an opportunity to close the gap and kill. Seb nocked an arrow midstride and shot it across but it flew harmlessly into the mist. Others had more luck\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 Gugi put an arrow through the leading man\u8217\'92s leg, and the man behind him was struck down when an arrow rammed into the side of his skull. The two figures crumpled to the ground and those behind bumbled over them, but this did little to allay the chase. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then Moteah jumped down into the ravine.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb wondered what insanity could have possessed her to give those Hrkan Skulsi a leaping chance, and his wonder was answered in the next instant, when a thin, golden beam of Mazidfire came ripping right by his ear.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The line of this blazing beam shot out in the misty distance. Seb ducked low and avoided its swipe, but the men behind him weren\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t so lucky. The fire ran right through the back of Gugi\u8217\'92s head and burst out of his eye-socket as if his brains and bone weren\u8217\'92t there. As his body slumped down the stripe of fire burned a kerf into his skull, and then the fireline\u8217\'92s distant fulcrum swiveled and the beam of death swiped a downwards arc through the air, cutting four Ayramun into uneven halves as the fire smashed into the earth, sizzling the soggy clay as it went.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 As suddenly as it came, the Mazidfire was gone. Somewhere in the misty distance, the unseen Mazid had closed its mouth, and what was left of that golden beam ran roaring into earth, leaving in its wake charred flesh, black glass, glowing stone, and smoke.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All those still alive threw themselves down the ravine\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s steep slope. Seb bumped into a karkle bush on the way down and rolled uncontrolled to the bottom where he flopped belly-first onto the muddy ground and slid with a splash into the ravine\u8217\'92s nascent stream. The rest of the Ayramun were already scrambling to their feet and fleeing along after Moteah, but Seb stayed put. There in front of his very eyes was the bush he\u8217\'92d seen that morning, the bush from under which he\u8217\'92d pulled that dead body. Its black twigs bloomed above him like a monument to fate. His mind was unpinned by the significance of it, and he felt that awesome humbling chill which only comes when one glimpses under the veil of reality.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His mind spun with the significance of it. He tried to reel himself back by telling himself this bush was just a bush\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 no more or less a major player in the divine plan as the mud squishing against his stomach, or even Seb himself. Yes, this bush was just a bush.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And yet\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And yet he was supposed to crawl up under that bush and so he did. He crawled up under it, and he lay himself down, right down where that dead boy had been, and he watched through the brambles as the Hrks descended upon his straggling companions.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ten of the leaping Hrks were shot down by arrows before their feet landed in the ravine, leading to a lopsided melee in favor of the Ayramun. Yet the Skulsi, undaunted, charged on. Their feet flung mud as their powerful strides closed the distance as fast as wolves. The fighting was brutal, and Seb cowered under the bush lest the obligations of battle came to him. His gut turned at the sight of one man sticking his boot on the back of another\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s head, suffocating him in the }

This cruelty was paid in turn with a knife stuck through his gut. Side whittled side until there were only two combatantsremaining, two mud-grumbled men breathing hard with blades held out before them. Neither made a move as both were content to catch their breath}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The rain had stopped. The ravines stream was trickling. Seb felt the itch of purpose stirring in his stomach. Perhaps the bush had reserved him for this very moment. Here was an opportunity for decisive action, and this was all anyone could ever ask for, clarity of cause and effect\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 the outcome of a battle turned with him. Seb twisted out from under his bush to fire an arrow at the man he took to be a Hrk, but just as he did, two figures stepped up to the lip of the ravine above him. The shorter one opened its mouth and a golden beam of Mazidfire burst out. It cut both combatants in two.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb froze in fear at the sight of the Mazid and its Minder. He hustled back under the bush.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He had never seen a Mazid before, and he couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t see much of it now. It was shorter than its Minder by a good foot, a child\u8217\'92s height, and it was skinny, and its misshapen frame was wrapped up in black robes and a black cowl like a penitent priest. The rumors were that a Mazid looked and moved like a human but its eyes were ice. Seb couldn\u8217\'92t see the eyes, he could only see its hands and the general gauntness of its face, which was white as sea foam, like the creature had been dipped in cream. Its chin was smooth and hairless as an egg. The Minder was a normal Jandri man, dressed in the standard scribal robes\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 rich blue with a blue hooded cape that mantled his broad shoulders like a pelt.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Another man joined the two figures up on that bank. Unlike the others, he was a natural born Hrk through and through\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 blackred hair, greying around the temples, with copper skin and eyebrows so thick they could flog lizardskin. His dark cloak was held together by a silver sunrose brooch\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 the mark of military command. This man marched up to the much shorter Mazid bearing a look of such contempt that it seemed to Seb that he was about strike the creature, but he merely pointed to the dead men down in the ravine and shouted, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Explain yourself!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Mazid said meekly, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know what you mean.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You killed one of my men.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93So you killed both of them?\u8221\'94 The commander turned to the Mazid\u8217\'92s Minder and said, \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know how you people breed these things, but something\u8217\'92s wrong. Each one is dumber than the last.\u8221\'94}

So bear it, captain\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 those are not my words, but theirs.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Skulsi captain looked like he was about to strangle them both.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Mazid, caught like a child between quarreling parents, bowed its head respectfully and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Minder tissked his annoyance. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What use does the captain have for an apology? Tell me, what can he }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 do}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  with it?\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In the Minder\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s hand was a short rod of wood wrapped in braided leather. He held it up to the captain and said, \u8220\'93You may hit it if you like. It won\u8217\'92t hurt the creature. It doesn\u8217\'92t feel pain, but I find it works out my frustrations nonetheless.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Captain took the rod firm in hand.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Avoid the head and neck,\u8221\'94 said the Minder.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The captain swung the rod and brought it down hard on the Mazid\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder socket. The whole arm sunk down and went limp, clearly dislocated, and it looked brutal, but Seb winced more than the Mazid did.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Captain stepped back to appreciate the bludgeoning, then said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They don\u8217\'92t make Mazidai like they used to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They don\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a wonder the Lords make use of these things at all,\u8221\'94 said the captain. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92ve long outlived their usefulness. We Skulsi can handle these outlaws on our own.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribal Minder appeared hurt by this remark. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Captain,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93the only reason you\u8217\'92re dealing with outlaws at all is because the outland tribes are too whipped by the Mazidai to become anything more than outlaws. Get rid of me and my kind, and you might find yourself on the front line of a real battle.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What do you mean, a }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 real}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  battle?\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I meant no disrespect.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It sounded like disrespect.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I assure you, I meant no disrespect.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The captain glared at the Minder, then }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t have time for this,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ve work to do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said the Minder as he drew his lips tight. \u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t have a captain of the Skulsi brewing discontent behind my back. Out with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old captain glowered and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Remember that }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 you}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  are here to make things easier for }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 me}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 , not the other way around. And I\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d say that killing my men outright is a violation of that mission. Worthy of censure. If you were not a Minder I would have had you burned out for incompetency.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Minder was unimpressed. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, if I were not a Minder you could do all manner of things. But fantasies are the domain of children and beggars, not soldiers who stand up straight. White light, we speak of the decline of the Mazidai, but if you are Hrkan Skulsi then I worry doubly for the Lordship.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93}{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 You }{\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 have a problem with }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 me}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ?\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}

Worry about yourself, captain, lest that self-important stomach growl too loudly forget the station of its Spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Are you threatening me?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. You should be stricter with your sentiments, given how easily I could end you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The captain smirked, put his hands on his hips, and eyed the pudgy Minder with amusement. He said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I doubt you have the control. Just the other day one of my men saw your Mazid let an outland poke run free. It could have easily burned the man down, but it didn\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Minder looked upon his Mazid with some confusion and asked it, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Is that true?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 said the Mazid meekly. \u8220\'93The man posed no imminent threat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Did I tell you to spare our quarry if it posed no imminent threat?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Did I give any order that could be construed as a grant of mercy to any of these outland pokes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Then tell me, why did you not burn him down?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Mazid gave no answer.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That was not a rhetorical question,\u8221\'94 the Minder said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I guess\u8230\'85I\u8217\'92m not sure\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93}{\f2\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 You\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92re not sure!}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ?\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94 the Minder exclaimed, as if the utterance was not possible.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Hah!\u8221\'94 laughed the captain. \u8220\'93You see? You\u8217\'92ve barely got a hold of that thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shut up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Wait until Lord Stryt hears about this. He\u8217\'92ll have you out in the pastures where you belong, minding sheep not Mazidai.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Minder countenanced the captain\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s threat with a grim nod. Seb could feel the captain\u8217\'92s great smugness even from his spot down under his bush. Then the Minder said to the Mazid, \u8220\'93Obo, kill that man.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Mazid\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s throat began to glow gold and an eyeblink later its mouth was alight with the fire of gods. A thin beam shot out, and a heartbeat later the captain crumpled to the ground\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 in the place where his forehead used to be was a black and smoldering hole. What was left of his face was fixed in hurtled surprise.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Minder grunted in satisfaction, then he looked down on his Mazid with contempt and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t ever think about what you want or don\u8217\'92t want. You don\u8217\'92t have wants. Get creative with my orders again and I\u8217\'92ll have us both sent back to the guild for\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His words were interrupted by the sight of the Mazid wandering off. It shuffled towards the ravine\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s lip and began to climb down into it. Despite its apparent frailty, its movements were deliberate and precise. It hopped down to the bottom and began to walk towards Seb\u8217\'92s bush.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing?\u8221\'94 the Minder spat, but the Mazid did not answer. It was nearing Seb\u8217\'92s bush, and it was close enough now that Seb could see its gaunt visage clearly. It was a ghoul of a person, with gray, empty eyes, and when they settled on Seb he saw a shimmer of gold behind them.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Stop!\u8221\'94 the Minder commanded with a shout. The word seemed to shake the Mazid\u8217\'92s spine. It paused, struggling with each step, then continued on as if laden with chains.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I said STOP!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Minder\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s command shook the Mazid whole, and it stumbled forward, resisting.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Up on the ledge, the Minder pulled himself up to his full height.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He shouted, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93STOP!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Every single muscle in the Mazid\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s body snapped taut. The sad creature stood still for a moment, but it stood unbalanced, and when the lightest breeze blew through the ravine it fell over stiff as stone. The sound of the Mazid splashing into the muddy ground was slight, as if it were no heavier than a tossed blanket.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Its unsettling eyes remained unnervingly alert. They swiveled in their sockets and found Seb inside his bush. Seb lay transfixed. He\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d looked every manner of creature in the eye in his long journeys through the Sand, and in each of them he\u8217\'92d found some sort of kinship\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 not so when he beheld the Mazid.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His fixation on this creature was broken when the Minder stomped down into the belly of the ravine. The short climb had put him out of breath, and he stood over the Mazid and gave it a probing kick. Then he cursed his own luck, and then he bent down picked the creature up and put it upon on his shoulder and began to walk away.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seeing the Minder\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s back turned, Seb\u8217\'92s instinct for murder took over. He slithered out of his bush, drew his knife, and matched the Minder\u8217\'92s footfalls. He closed the distance until he could no longer contain his excitement, and he screamed such a deep and wild scream that it surprised even himself. The Minder dropped the stiff Mazid in fright, and Seb\u8217\'92s knife was suddenly upon him, and it followed him down to the ground with a flurry of blows. The Minder rolled around and tried to scramble free, but Seb\u8217\'92s knife was there, again in the back, under the shoulder blade, in the ribs, in the neck, then severing two tendons in his flailing arm. Seb jabbed at the man\u8217\'92s throat, and did not let up until his knife slipped out of his hand.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Minder was dead.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb looked towards the Mazid, and it had gone limp. Even its eyes were stilled, for it was no longer bound to any will. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb picked the Mazid up. It was twice as light as the dead boy he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d carried earlier that day. He carried it over to the karkle bush because he didn\u8217\'92t know what else to do with it. There was no clear divine sign here for him to read. He might be alone. The rest of the Ayramun might be dead. It could be that Skulsi would come wandering back at any moment. So he hid. He hid underneath that karkle bush with that limp Mazid, and for the first time in his entire sober life he was living completely in the moment. He felt like a god.}}
