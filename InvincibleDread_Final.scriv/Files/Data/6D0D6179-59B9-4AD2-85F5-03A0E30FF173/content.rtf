The man walking behind Mandri, the short and stout man whose bread wasn\u8217\'92t baked all the way through, his name was Hill, and according to Hill, these two names were the only two things that Mandri needed to know. Don\u8217\'92t bother with \u8216\'91why\u8217\'92, or \u8216\'91what\u8217\'92s going on\u8217\'92, or \u8216\'91I can\u8217\'92t see where I\u8217\'92m going\u8217\'92, the only thing that mattered was that Seb was in front, Hill was behind, and that was the way things were going to be. If Mandri did so much as breathe too loudly for Hill\u8217\'92s comfort, that was sufficient cause for an open handed smack on the back of the head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Unfortunately, it was impossible for Mandri to avoid making noise because sound carried well in a rock-hewn tunnel, and Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s once-dead-legs were as stiff as rods so every step begged a groan. Every bend of knee felt like a knife stabbing his thigh. Instead of striding through the dark like Hill wanted him to, Mandri shuffled through it on sensitive feet, doing what he could to avoid the trash that littered the floor, and that was hard to do too as well, because the tunnel was a dumping ground.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was a horde of trash piled all the way up the low ceiling. It was not a place for unshod feet, for hidden in the shadows of the dancing torchlight were the picked-clean bones of small animals all scattered amongst splintered balkanut which looked like shattered skulls.  Curved clay shards of wasted jars and all manner of organic waste was the worst of it. Mandri stepped in a cold and gooey lumps of muck that glistened when it welled up in between his toes\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t figure what this substance was until Hill stepped in it, too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Black Spark, Seb! Was this you?\u8221\'94 Hill was pointing down at a dark stain that soured the toe of his hard leather boot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb shoved Mandri aside so she could get an eye on it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Course not,\u8221\'94she protested.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why can\u8217\'92t you shit in the hole like everyone else?\u8221\'94 Hill challenged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It wasn\u8217\'92t me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s always you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was Chopper.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s always you or Chopper, and since this shit is half green, that means it\u8217\'92s you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb turned a cold shoulder to Hill\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s indignation, and she started off again into the dark. Hill nudged Mandri to follow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t play blame games with me,\u8221\'94 Seb said as she adjusted Obo\u8217\'92s dead weight on her shoulder. \u8220\'93Who\u8217\'92s the one pilin\u8217\'92 up all this trash in here, huh? Ya know there\u8217\'92s a hole for all this, too, but ya\u8217\'92ll too lazy. Get yourself together fore you come and pick on my habits.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri followed along timidly, clutching his wounded right arm against his chest, lest it brush up against the fetid clutter and get infected. He searched the shadow-strewn ground for a clean edge of stone to scrape his shit-stained foot against, but found none. The tunnel was cramped tight with so much junk that the junk itself seemed part of the natural stone. In fact, not one bit of stone could be seen in the flickering torchlight, not even on the low ceiling, for that was mottled over in black moldy growths. All in all it was a loathsome place, and with each step Mandri became more and more convinced that he was back in the good old land of the living, because this was life in all its slovenly, pack-rat glory.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t until the trio left this rubbish tunnel and spilled out into a cleaner, roomier tunnel that Mandri was sure\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this was a bandit\u8217\'92s nest, not some corridor of Shis. On one side of this tunnel was a store of chopped lumber, and stacked crosswise on the other side were plump canvas bags branded with a black Hrkan sunrose compass. Strewn on the floor in between this stolen grain and the firewood was all manner of toe-jamming obstructions\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 beer pots, sweetgrass baskets filled with dried-out dung fuel, holey-soled and stringless leather boots, a bundle of crude arrows propped up inside a beer pot, more beer pots. Seb picked her way around all this junk as if she\u8217\'92d placed each piece herself, like a pampered toddler wading through scattered toys, and on her shoulder, slung like a freshly slaughtered sty-pig, was Obo. His unfortunate nose bobbed in and out of Seb\u8217\'92s armpit with every step.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  It was hard to believe anyone could bring a Mazid down so low, and that these two boorish bandits were involved was inconceivable. Seb herself was as unimposing as an outland poke could be, dirty and hungry looking, with sunken eyes. She looked like desperation itself more than a person, and she wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the dangerous kind of desperation either. She was that sad kind of desperation that Mandri could defeat by simply looking away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri looked behind at Hill. Hill had his plump pinky finger stuck halfway up his own nose, digging for gold.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri grimaced. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Leave some for me,\u8221\'94 he joked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Hill 's eyes flashed, his cheeks flushed, and he gave Mandri an uncivil punch in the ribs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get going!\u8221\'94 he shouted, and Mandri got going. He took two steps, and when that wasn\u8217\'92t hurried enough, Hill shoved him in the back as if that would help. Mandri\u8217\'92s stiff legs couldn\u8217\'92t cope with this crude encouragement and he tumbled forward into Seb\u8217\'92s hips. Then Seb went sprawling, too, and so did Obo. The three of them tumbled together into the glinting darkness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You gutwipe!\u8221\'94 Seb shouted at Hill.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She rolled over, for she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d landed right on top of Obo. Hill rushed over and spread his torchlight upon the Mazid\u8217\'92s limp form. He studied the Obo\u8217\'92s limbs for breaks and scrapes. The scar on Obo\u8217\'92s chest had popped another stitch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can\u8217\'92t trust you with a feather,\u8221\'94 he said to Seb before picking Obo up under his arm. He gestured towards Mandri with his torch. \u8220\'93Take the little dent out to the pit,\u8221\'94 he commanded. Then he marched on and disappeared into a sidelong passage, taking his torchlight with him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Dark Sparked taker,\u8221\'94 Seb muttered after him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was sad to see Hill go, as now he was alone with a pokey old woman who was grumbling curses in pitch black dark. A hiss and a robe-swish later, and he felt the cold iron point of a dagger prodding his back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you think about tryin\u8217\'92 nothin\u8217\'92 stupid,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92d I say about talkin\u8217\'92? Now stand up and get movin\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stood up and he started to move in the direction he supposed Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dagger wanted him to go. The two of them walked like this for a spell, bumbling through the dark, toes and knees knocking into whatever happened to be in their way. Eventually they rounded a bend and came to yet another tunnel, one which gave way to the blinding light of day. It wasn\u8217\'92t far, and when they finally emerged into the sunlight\u8217\'92s warmth, Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t see a thing through the burned in image of day.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dagger relented, and Mandri\u8217\'92s aching legs took the opportunity to collapse. Instead of slamming into rock, his knees splashed into warm, soothing sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He dug his good hand into it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was warm and inviting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He wanted to wriggle into it like a sand flea.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s Ayram!?\u8221\'94 Seb shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In the cave,\u8221\'94 said a gruff voice. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 Where}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  in the cave?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Inside.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb exclaimed her disdain with click of her tongue, and she darted back into the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri tried to blink out the bright white blotch of day which occluded his vision, but that blotch only faded into a fainter blotch of white. He looked up, and instead of a wide blue sky there was a circle of blue encased in white. A few blinks more, and that whiteness resolved into a circling escarpment of white stone rock. He was sitting at the bottom of a colossal limestone bucket, a pit cave, with walls some fifty feet tall. The prenoon sun angled its light down the sides of this bucket, leaving Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s half of the pit in a dusty, radiant glow, and the other half in a crescent shadow warmed orange from the sand\u8217\'92s reflected light.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There were dark figures milling about in that warm shadow on the opposite side, some standing, some sitting. They were all looking at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One of them stepped forward into the sunlight\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a dark Zosan girl. Her smooth face was framed by a tight white headscarf, with the unwrapped end hanging loose around the neck. The rest of her figure was shrouded to the ankles by a beige robe. It was a clean and simple look, and despite the wear and tear that spoke of a life roughing it out in the Sand, the woman wore it all with a hint of regal bearing, shoulders held in a kind of self-important swoop that showed she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been trained in the art of woman-standing-still. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re the dead boy,\u8221\'94 she said. Her voice was as uncompromising as her posture, though she wasn\u8217\'92t much older than Mandri. And while her statement was a simple matter of fact, the way she said it suggested it was some keen insight obvious only to her. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And who are you?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked. He was anxious to not appear ruffled. He sat back on his heels and contemplated standing up but decided against it because he wasn\u8217\'92t sure if his legs could manage it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t speak without permission,\u8221\'94 she said as she wrinkled her nose. He supposed she could smell rot on him. \u8220\'93I am Moteah.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t speak.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sorry.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah huffed at this final barb, then turned to the scraggly men and women behind her, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Someone get the boy fit for walking. And make sure he doesn\u8217\'92t speak.\u8221\'94 Then she walked into caves.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get him fit for a dog\u8217\'92s dick,\u8221\'94 said a grumbling voice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shut up, Weeg.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You shut up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No one\u8217\'92s to mess with the boy until Ayram\u8217\'92s sussed him out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The woman who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d come to Mandri\u8217\'92s defense was a silver-haired Jandri poke, athletic, wearing a fitted brown robe with a choking neckline ornamented by knotted leather tassels the length of fingers. This robe, combined with her sun-leathered skin and general greasiness, made her seem like an overgrown taproot come to life. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My name\u8217\'92s Forty,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93And you\u8217\'92re Mandri?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can speak,\u8221\'94 Forty said, amused. She then turned around and chided the shadows. \u8220\'93I shouldn\u8217\'92t have to say this, but things being what they are\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no one touches a hair on this prick\u8217\'92s head unless Ayram says so.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A few unhappy grunts followed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now, Who\u8217\'92s got Papi\u8217\'92s clothes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When no one answered, Forty pointed towards Mandri with an open hand and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The boy needs robes before we set out and Papi\u8217\'92s will fit. So, who\u8217\'92s got \u8216\'91em?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Papi\u8217\'92s not been dead two days,\u8221\'94 said one unhappy shadow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So? Do you think Papi cares what happens to his clothes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I care.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you take his clothes, then, Weeg?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who did?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tob did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty turned to a lounging man tucked right inside the bottom swerve of the pit\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s crescent shadow. She motioned for Mandri to follow her across the pit and into the shade, and as she sauntered towards this burly fellow he stretched out amongst a couple burlap sacks, claiming them all with his with is splayed out arms and legs. Between the man\u8217\'92s beard, brows, and hair there was hardly a splotch of skin on him. There was a mouth on his head somewhere, because sticking out of the beard was a fat, stubby pipe. The smoke swirling out of it stank of freeweed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri nodded at this wiry black bush, but it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t nod back. Instead it said, \u8220\'93The bastard can freeze and burn for all I care.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is Tob,\u8221\'94 said Forty, as she sat down next to the man.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri nodded again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tob grunted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tob is an idiot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And Forty\u8217\'92s dried-up,\u8221\'94 Tob retorted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty pointed to the bundle of clothes that lay between Tob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s elbow and armpit. \u8220\'93Are those Papi\u8217\'92s clothes?\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tob rolled onto his side and patted the bundle with care. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They are. Make a nice pillow, don\u8217\'92t they?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s have them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only way the boy here is getting them is if Ayram commands it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Give them here,\u8221\'94 said Forty, undeterred. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Woman\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what did I just say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You want to explain to Ayram why the boy isn\u8217\'92t ready to walk?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tob took a thoughtful drag from his pipe. He held the smoke captive in his barrel chest for a long moment, and the exhale, when it came, was a sheepish attempt to obscure a reluctant, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty pulled the bundle of clothes out from under his bushy bulk. She tossed it to Mandri as Tob grumbled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Last I checked we was called the Ayramun, not the Fortyun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Never said we was called anything else.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri picked at the troublesome knot which kept the outfit wrapped tight, and Tob was clear to stress, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You need be remembering who those clothes belong to. They\u8217\'92re Ayram\u8217\'92s. Everything is Ayram\u8217\'92s here. Clothes on my back. Those clothes there. The food that\u8217\'92s coming to your belly. It\u8217\'92s all loaned out, if you like. Everything\u8217\'92s Ayram\u8217\'92s. Not yours. Not Moteah\u8217\'92s. And not Forty\u8217\'92s either. So don\u8217\'92t get confused by the way the women act.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri finally pulled the plaited hemp string free, and he unrolled the apparel onto the ground. There was a thickish brown, three-layered robe all crumpled up with salt and sweat, and next to it was a simple hoodscarf, brown as well. The dead Papi had no eye for flair, though that suited Mandri just fine. There was also a pair of rawhide boots that, when Mandri put them on, seemed cut perfectly to size. It was all in good shape, too, though the robe was loosely-fit and had a blood stain around the collar, and there was a long splotch of blood running down the left arm as well. In putting it on, Mandri was careful not to stain the right sleeve with his poultice-wrapped wrist, which at this point of was leaking a dark, almost black, ooze.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri finally had it all on, with the tails of the hoodscarf wrapped clumsily around his neck, he felt transformed. He was as pokey as the rest of them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tob looked him up and down. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what Papi wore when he got killed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, I figured.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re not supposed to speak,\u8221\'94 said Tob as blew a puff of smoke in Mandri\u8217\'92s direction.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can I ask why not?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A gruff voice rose up from the shadows behind. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Cause you a damned Minder, you dent.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The charge had come from Weeg. Weeg was a dirty and disheveled man who looked like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d just got done rolling down a dune. Sand was stuck to his unreasonably flat and blocky face. His nose was a bulbous root\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 must have been broken at least a hundred times.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pull off him,\u8221\'94 Forty said. \u8220\'93It doesn\u8217\'92t matter if he talks. Not like the Mazid\u8217\'92s out here anyways. And look at him\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 not like he knows any curses.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri looked down at his bloodstained sleeve. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you don\u8217\'92t want me wearing these robes, I don\u8217\'92t need to. I\u8217\'92m fine with just my tunic.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Won\u8217\'92t be fine when we head out into the Sand,\u8221\'94 said Forty, chuckling. \u8220\'93That skimpy tunic would leave your legs in boils.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hell of a lot wrong with Papi\u8217\'92s robes too,\u8221\'94 said Tob. \u8220\'93Them robe\u8217\'92s weave is bad luck\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the warp to weft is three to one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t start,\u8221\'94 said Forty.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This ain\u8217\'92t a matter of startin\u8217\'92 and stoppin\u8217\'92. A three to one weave is plain bad luck. That\u8217\'92s how it is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty groaned and Tob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s caterpillar brow jumped at Mandri. \u8220\'93Women don\u8217\'92t know about luck, do they? Course, you don\u8217\'92t know about it either, do you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrugged and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I feel a little bit lucky. I mean, I\u8217\'92m alive, aren\u8217\'92t I? Couple of fingers ago I thought I was dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, you weren\u8217\'92t dead,\u8221\'94 Tob said emphatically. \u8220\'93You were body dead, sure, but your Spark was still burning.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Think I know? Don\u8217\'92t ask me about witch business. All I know is that when a person gets body-dead but their stomach\u8217\'92s still burns, that only means one thing.\u8221\'94 He paused and supped his pipe to savor the anticipation on Mandri\u8217\'92s face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty pooed the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s slackness and finished the thought. \u8220\'93We found you half-dead in the Junei hills, dressed up as food for the Amalgamete.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The word Amalgamete triggered a memory. He blanched as Tob puffed out a snot of smoke right at him. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And there\u8217\'92s only one thing the Amalgamete\u8217\'92s stomach do with its food,\u8221\'94 Tob said, \u8220\'93And that\u8217\'92s make demons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Demons?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s beady eyes livened up. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s right. You woulda been made a demon. Now, you might think that it\u8217\'92s lucky that you didn\u8217\'92t, but look what\u8217\'92s happened, you got found by a witch that reads the future, and that future said, \u8216\'91This bastard is gonna have to lose his hand and lose his mind to a Mazid\u8217\'92, and that\u8217\'92s just as bad.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bad luck on him means bad luck on us,\u8221\'94 said Weeg, from behind. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll tell you all, Elrahet been readin\u8217\'92 the future upside down. That boy there is a curse. Sun as my light, that boy there is gonna get us all killed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That so?\u8221\'94 Tob asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I saw that boy fall out of that damned corpsecart we was ambushin\u8217\'92. An look what happened\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 more n\u8217\'92 half of us dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty intervened again. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We were dealing with a Mazid and eighty something Skulsi. We were always gonna lose people. This little prick had nothing to do with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Weeg scrunched up his ruined nose, which gave an unsightly curl to the left and settled with a buckling-crack into a painful sneer. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Woulda been less if it weren\u8217\'92t such a shitshow, and you tell me, how\u8217\'92d things go down that way?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll tell you,\u8221\'94 said Tob.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty rolled her eyes and said derisively, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me guess\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 we got unlucky?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Damn right. And there\u8217\'92s things you need to know about Luck. Luck is like peelin\u8217\'92 plaster, you have to\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty interrupted with a mule-like whine. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tob,\u8221\'94 she said, \u8220\'93You're the unluckiest bastard in the world. You don\u8217\'92t know shit about luck.\u8221\'94 She looked to Mandri through tired eyes and added, \u8220\'93He hides his face in all that hair cause he\u8217\'92s so damned ugly. And guess how he got those scars. The man got his head chewed up by a keenkedra.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But I survived!\u8221\'94 Tob exclaimed. \u8220\'93Who has touched tongues with a full-grown keenki and lived to tell about it? No one! None but }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 me}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 . And why? Because of my luck.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re lucky you survived, but you were as unlucky as a Hrkan prick to ever get swallowed in the first place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the thing!\u8221\'94 Tob exclaimed, almost shouting, his left eye wide with excitement, revealing to Mandri that under all that hair the right side of his face was paralyzed. Something like that is usually obvious from the way the lips skew when a person speaks, but Tob\u8217\'92s mouth was little more than a hole in the black broom that was his beard, and while that hole did skew, the right side had an excuse for not moving as it was busy clenching his pipe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You need some bad luck to really know about luck,\u8221\'94 said Tob. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s the always-lucky that don\u8217\'92t know a thing about luck because they don\u8217\'92t need to. They don\u8217\'92t step in any holes and they get to believin\u8217\'92 that holes don\u8217\'92t exist. But I\u8217\'92ve stepped in all the holes. I know my way around them by now. I\u8217\'92ve got Luck mapped out as well as anybody who ever lived.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That don\u8217\'92t make sense.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tob shrugged Forty off and stayed steady on Mandri. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I shoot an arrow at you, what says whether or not it kills you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Luck?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty cut in again, saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Luck has nothing to do with it. It\u8217\'92s skill.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s luck!\u8221\'94 Tob retorted. \u8220\'93Skill says whether or not you hit the target. You aim at the neck, and if you\u8217\'92re skilled, you hit the neck. Luck says whether it rips through the pipes or only scratches the throat.\u8221\'94 As proof of his words, Tob pulled up his beard to reveal, lurking under a scraggle of neck hair, a long white scar that wrapped around his throat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Looks like someone tried to chop your head off,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A shorter, stunted, bald man who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been snoozing away perked up and shouted, \u8220\'93Chop!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All eyes turned to this man, alarmed, and Tob was quick to shout back \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No!\u8221\'94, with expressive hands. \u8220\'93No chop. No chop today.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Chop?\u8221\'94 the bald man asked again, disappointed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No chop,\u8221\'94 Tob repeated.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The bald man pouted and lay back down. As soon his head hit his pack of a pillow he was snoozing again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tob sighed and said to Mandri, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t say that word around Chopper unless you need something cut. And if you need something cut you better find him and let him do it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 or else. Anyways, like I was sayin\u8217\'92, the arrow that did my neck was shot from only twenty paces. Busted right through me. And that arrow came from a Scweeman no less\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 as skilled as any here with a bow. But he couldn\u8217\'92t beat my luck. I\u8217\'92d wager more than money that my good luck is what saved me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He says that, but he won\u8217\'92t ever actually wager anything,\u8221\'94 Forty snipped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because it\u8217\'92s not right for me to take advantage of others in matters of luck.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about a wager on }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 him}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 asked the gruff Weeg, pointing a hateful finger at Mandri. \u8220\'93I bet ten wraps this walkin\u8217\'92 curse is gonna get us all killed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty cracked a wry smile. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If we\u8217\'92re all killed, then how are you gonna come and collect?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I bet twenty!\u8221\'94 said Weeg.  \u8220\'93Why\u8217\'92d Elrahet make him Minder anyways?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t hear you volunteer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You didn\u8217\'92t either.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But I\u8217\'92m not complaining, am I?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should! Makin\u8217\'92 a fresh pulled poke Minder of a Mazid weren\u8217\'92t never part of the plan. Who says he ain\u8217\'92t gonna turn the Mazid on us and roast us all in golden fire?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet says it,\u8221\'94 was Forty\u8217\'92s reply, and somehow that was enough to end the argument. Weeg sneered for the sake of it, baring his crooked yellow teeth, but after that he settled down, but not before getting in a final barb. \u8220\'93Can\u8217\'92t trust a fresh pulled poke to keep the piss out their pants.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty rolled her eyes, and Mandri took the opportunity to rest his aching legs by sitting down next to her, for she seemed to be the only person who would tolerate him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Better get used to waiting,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s half of what we do around here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tob overheard and added, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Welcome to the Ayramun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From then on, they sat and waited in that crescent shadow in silence. This gave Mandri time to think about how this ragged band of sand-spitting pokes had killed eighty-something Skulsi and captured a Mazid. On top of that, for some god-bothering reason, they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d found Mandri\u8217\'92s body and had brought him back to life just to make him the Mazid\u8217\'92s Minder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Why?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Only Solraheen knew. Only Solraheen  and some old bat named Elrahet. Since Solraheen was dead, that left Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Probably Ayram knew as well.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri sat and waited for one of them to make an entrance.}}
