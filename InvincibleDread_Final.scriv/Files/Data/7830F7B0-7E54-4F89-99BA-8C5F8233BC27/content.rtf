\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who is Gil?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My ox.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I saw what I saw.\u8221\'94}

You know that there is a difference between seeing and understanding, and I suspect you know that there is a difference between the sensation of understanding and actual understanding.\u8221\'94}

You believe it as easily as you believe the stories about how the world came to be, but none of these stories are true.\u8221\'94 He pointed to the fresco of Solraheen and Schisol. \u8220\'93This story here is a lie. It claims that Solraheen called forth a stone of Fabled Black from the night to end Himself and His evil brother\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it is a simple and neat story, but it is not the truth.\u8221\'94}}
