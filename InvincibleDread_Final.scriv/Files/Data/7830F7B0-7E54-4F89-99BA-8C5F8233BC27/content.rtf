\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who is Gil?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My ox.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 evil}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  about that? Have you never chewed on a slab of tripe?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She didn\u8217\'92t eat the stomach. She ate Gil\u8217\'92s Spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s white eyebrows jumped and he reflexively muttered, \u8220\'93Interesting\u8230\'85but I doubt you saw the beast\u8217\'92s Spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I saw what I saw.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Please, Mandri, you\u8217\'92re too intelligent to lean on tautology. You know that there is a difference between seeing and understanding, and I suspect you know that there is a difference between the sensation of understanding and actual understanding.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I saw what I saw.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But how do you know you\u8217\'92re not lying to yourself? You\u8217\'92ve told yourself a story and you believe it. You believe it as easily as you believe the stories about how the world came to be, but none of these stories are true.\u8221\'94 He pointed to the fresco of Solraheen and Schisol. \u8220\'93This story here is a lie. It claims that Solraheen called forth a stone of Fabled Black from the night to end Himself and His evil brother\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it is a simple and neat story, but it is not the truth.\u8221\'94}

Mandri supposed the creature was a \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91him\u8217\'92, but he wasn\u8217\'92t sure, for its groin was completely smooth and lacked any sign of gender. But \u8216\'91he\u8217\'92 and \u8216\'91she\u8217\'92 makes no difference when the subject in question was a demon, for that\u8217\'92s what Mandri supposed. That\u8217\'92s the only possible thing it could be.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Despite this demon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s deformities, its face was smooth and fair, if a little underfed, and its serene expression was couched in generic Hrkan features\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 thin lips and sad eyes, all in symmetrical and genderless proportions. And it was alive.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Why a demon had met such abuse, Mandri was not sure. Perhaps this was a human half-transformed, still suffering through its long punishment. A cell-mate of sorts. A vision of what was in store for him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had no doubt he would be tortured as well. And after torture, there would come periods of healing, hence the stitching on the demon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest. This all made sense because Shis couldn\u8217\'92t be all-torture all-the-time. There would need to be quiet moments to allow for reflection. And no doubt the torture would fit the crimes he\u8217\'92d committed up on the surface. This creature here had committed a crime of passion. Why else would they cut through to its heart? It also explained the erasure of its genitalia. No doubt this was some Hrkan youth who had succumbed to the passions of temptation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was such a pitiful sight. Mandri might have been scared of it, but the creature didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t seem capable of moving. It never even looked at Mandri. Eventually it fell asleep, and when it did, Mandri felt at ease enough to close his eyes and try to predict what style torture was in store.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He examined the rest of his body piece by piece, and nothing was black and rotting as he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d expected, though he was much dirtier. He made to grab the blanket to cover his legs from the chill, and that\u8217\'92s when he realized his right hand was missing. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Completely gone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Missing at the wrist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In its place was a weedy brown poultice wrapped around the nub of his forearm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The demons had taken his dominant hand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His brush-wielding hand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Of course.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The symbolism was unsophisticated\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d rejected his great talent and now he\u8217\'92d lost it all together.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t feel a thing. Not the slightest twinge of pain.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He regretted the careless remark immediately, for the sound attracted the attention of the ghoul, whose pale eyes studied him with an uncomfortable curiosity. The creature then pushed itself upright, matching Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pose, and suddenly it didn\u8217\'92t seem so helpless.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri decided he should look for a way out of this cramped little space.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He stood up, slow and deliberate, half because he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to make any sudden movements that could be misinterpreted, and half because his muscles simply couldn\u8217\'92t move any faster. He backed up against his side of the cave and his tousled hair brushed against the low ceiling. He felt his way along the sandstone towards the shadows on his right.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. So, Mandri shuffled back the other way, to the left, keeping close to the rock, staying as far away as he could from the pale creature who still watched him with intent. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s searching fingers found a wide crack in the rock behind him. It seemed to be a dark opening that he could shimmy through, but when he stuck his good arm into it, his fingers butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his back exposed in present company, he returned to his brown blanket and straw bed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was only one other direction to explore\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 behind the creature\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s right shoulder was a hole in the rock that was wide enough to crawl into. Mandri\u8217\'92s eyes strained to see if it dead-ended.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no way out that way,\u8221\'94 the demon said. Its voice was even and clear, shockingly free of the rankling pain it must be feeling from the wound on its chest. \u8220\'93Or I should say, there }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  an opening there that leads straight up, but it is not something you can fit through. I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92m afraid it\u8217\'92s just another cranny for the lizards.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lizards?\u8221\'94 The word flew out of Mandri\u8217\'92s mouth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. Lizards,\u8221\'94 the demon said. It pointed up with its delicate hand. There on the ceiling, half-buried in sooty cracks, were a dozen or so black blobs. Mandri took them for some strange fungal growth, and then one of them squeaked and scurried along the ceiling towards the unexplored passageway. Its tiny talons scratched the rock as it went. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The pale demon laughed. It was an inviting laugh, and it had an unmistakable Hrkan lilt. Mandri wondered if this half-boy-half-demon still remembered who it was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri asked it straight, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My name is Obo,\u8221\'94 said the creature.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri pulled his blanket up tight around his shoulders. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you a demon?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo smiled. His smile was bright even in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs, but wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t surprised, for a disarming smile could be as useful for a demon\u8217\'92s purposes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you think I\u8217\'92m a demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You deny it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do. I am not a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well you look like a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your body is a perversion.\u8221\'94}
