Every so often a new volume is commissioned, so multiple AYB volumes exist for a number of books of the Bible.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 The\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 International Critical Commentary}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~series is similar to the\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 Anchor Yale Bible}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~series, but has been around long enough that some of the earlier volumes are in the public domain and can be downloaded from Google Books or the Internet Archive.

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Okay, so, in 2 Corinthians 11, Paul is talking about all the horrible things that have come to him for spreading the Gospel, and he mentions a peculiar story about escaping in a basket, lowered from a window while a local leader in Damascus (under King Aretas) has sent the guards to arrest Paul. That's how Paul himself tells the story.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 The story is also told in Acts 9 shortly after Paul's conversion (in Damascus). But this time, it's the Jews that want Paul dead. Not to arrest him, but it's a plot to kill him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 So there's an obvious contradiction, right? Paul's escape from Damascus in a basket through a window... One telling has him escaping an arrest warrant issued by a local leader under some king called Aretas (the people of Damascus were not Jews) and another telling of the same escape story has him escaping a murder plot by the Jews in Damascus.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 So, first of all, are these accounts reconcilable? Could it be that Paul escaped both the arrest warrant and murder plot, one after another, both by hiding in a basket? Maybe he hid in basket to get out of a house, and then in a basket again to get out of the city?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Second, why the change? The author of Acts is (supposedly) a companion of Paul. Which means he would've heard the story from Paul, some time after it happened. Maybe Paul misremembered the details when he told the Acts author? Or did the Acts author change the details on his own? I don't believe Acts was written by Luke the Physician. I think it is a much, MUCH later work by someone else who sorta puts himself into the story to give his book more credibility. Paul was a well known name. If your story was written by his companions, the story will spread faster.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Finally, from a strictly scholarly standpoint, why include the story at all if you're just gonna contradict it? Why would the Acts author, claiming to be Luke, get something so wrong? 2 Corinthians already existed when Acts was written. Why not just make the details fit? Why run the risk of such an obvious contradiction that will undermine your whole intent of trying to look authentic? Couldn't a Corinthian scholar or church leader be like "umm, yeah, this new book of Acts directly contradicts a letter we got from Paul, so this book is trash". Why risk that?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Thanks for taking a look at my ramblings.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 What I am saying is that the author of Acts continually contradicts the letters of Paul. Sure, the basket story may be the most egregious case, but it is hardly the only one. Acts contradicts key statements in Paul's letters like:}
