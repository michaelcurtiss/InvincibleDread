A bink was a yellow nut the size of a tooth, with black spots on either end. They were quite bitter. Mandri preferred the bland Hrkan hardtack.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah said that binks were better for him than hardtack because they had healing properties. She said that there were mice living in the Sand that, if he could believe it, subsisted entirely on binks\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no water. The binks get them through the severest droughts. She once had a pet mouse and was careful to never let it drink, as a sort of experiment. It lived on a diet of binks until the mousey old age of two.}
