None present had ever seen it before. Elrahet claimed to have seen it despite also claiming to have no memory of it. Nobody challenged this incongruity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The well was huge. It was square, two-men wide, and it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s interior included a full set of stairs zig-zagging down to the bottom, some fifty yards deep. There was a bucket. Moto lowered it. The water he pulled up was salty and brackish.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There were fish in it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They were the ugliest little minnows that Mandri had ever seen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 blind pink fish with pulpy membranes where there should have been brilliant eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto gathered them up and cooked the them into a stew. According to even Seb, it was not delicious.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Afterwards, Seb began an argument with her own damned self. She said, between squelching chews of borcandi spine, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If ya take a barrel full o\u8217\'92 water and put a }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 livin\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  fish in it, the water overflows. But if ya put a }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 dead}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  fish in it, the water don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t overflow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She claimed this implied something about the size and weight of the Spark, but then she immediately discounted it. She went on like this for half a hand until Moto asked her if she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ever actually put a dead fish into a barrel of water. She said she hadn\u8217\'92t, so she filled a bowl with water, put a dead fish in it, and found that water overflowed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She did not know what to make of this.}}
