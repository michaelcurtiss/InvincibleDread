In the middle of this hall, on either side, were two sets of wide-wood double doors that opened up into large, dust-strewn storage rooms with empty floors. At the end of the hall was a spiraling staircase.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The second floor of the tower was a single enormous room which wrapped around a central pillar. There were two narrow windows in this room, one which looked west, towards the corpse-strewn courtyard and the Goree Pass, and the other looked east, out towards the desert and the Hrkan line. This desert view was obstructed by the rim-lit silhouettes of the Ayramun as they jostled with each other to get a better look at the Hrkan horse and rider.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram and  Elrahet were somewhere out there, ready to meet the fate they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d bought with the lives of their companions.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri watched all this from his seat on the staircase. When he was sure no one would notice, he ducked down into the dark of the first floor to dab one meager droplet of juice from the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon onto his tongue\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no more than that. The idea was to escape himself, not end up catatonic like before. He then plugged the tiny hole he\u8217\'92d made in the burgeon with a rolled up sliver of woolen rag, and he stuffed the blessed burgeon into the pocket of his sleeve to save for later. If he rationed it carefully, he reasoned, he could make the juice last for a week. The rest he\u8217\'92d roll flat and dry out, and from there he\u8217\'92d experiment to discover the best method of ingestion. He wouldn\u8217\'92t rule anything out. Then, he would steal another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He sat down on the fourth stair-step and waited there in the dark for the burgeonsight to take hold. He knew it wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t take long.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s Mandri?\u8221\'94 Purl asked from above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hid his disappointment well when he said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m down here!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want his absence noted, lest Seb put two and two together, so he climbed back up stairs to join the others.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl was the only one who wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t glued to the western window. She was sitting against the curving wall, still strapped into her pack. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t take it off,\u8221\'94 she said to Mandri when she noticed him starting to unshoulder his own burden. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We need to be ready to run.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It only takes a second to put it on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Leave it on,\u8221\'94 said Purl, demanding.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri plopped himself down right next to Purl, pack and all. He leaned into her and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you have any idea how we\u8217\'92re supposed to get out of this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ayram has a plan,\u8221\'94 she said flatly, as if she didn\u8217\'92t believe it either.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Didn\u8217\'92t seem like it to me. His words, if I recall, were, \u8216\'91I\u8217\'92ll figure it out\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When he says that it\u8217\'92s because he knows we won\u8217\'92t like the plan.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you sweating?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m stressed. And my pack is heavy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But it\u8217\'92s cold in here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, well, I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t about to admit that he\u8217\'92d just swallowed a single milky tear of a God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon, and it was making his heart skip beats. Strangely, it wasn\u8217\'92t doing anything for his vision.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl saw him sigh and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you that worried about the Mazid?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You mean Obo?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The first time I saw that Mazid, I watched it kill thirty Ayramun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wasn\u8217\'92t that the fault of his Minder?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He still should have apologized. At least, he shouldn\u8217\'92t be a prick about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think there\u8217\'92s only so much you can expect from a Sparkless Mazid. They\u8217\'92re deceitful\u8230\'85prideful\u8230\'85irritating.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And ugly,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri sank back into his pack, which was quite comfy to lean into with all the new additions. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Somehow, it\u8217\'92s all part of Obo\u8217\'92s charm. Like, somehow, if you take all those things together they all cancel each other out and it\u8217\'92s not so bad. Or maybe it\u8217\'92s just that everybody hates him and that\u8217\'92s why I\u8217\'92m drawn to him. It\u8217\'92s like, I mean\u8230\'85I don\u8217\'92t know\u8230\'85we get along.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That droplet from the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon wasn\u8217\'92t doing anything to lighten his mood. It wasn\u8217\'92t expanding the ceiling into infinity, it wasn\u8217\'92t swirling the colors of the floor. It certainly wasn\u8217\'92t tamping down on the feeling of guilt that was stirring way down in his stomach. His legs were heating up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He considered spritzing his tongue with some more of that burgeon juice, then decided against it. He should be bearing witness to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s final waking moments\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and they were his final moments, because even if this little gambit succeeded, there was no way the Ayramun were going to make it all the way to Jeket, much less free Solraheen. If he didn\u8217\'92t walk to that tower window and watch, then the memory of Obo\u8217\'92s passing would be the sole property of people who didn\u8217\'92t care.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shuffled his legs underneath him into a frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Going to watch?\u8221\'94 Purl asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Might as well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  There wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t room enough for him at the window, between all those excited elbows. Then Moto decided that he was needed down below, so he left, and Mandri was able to squeeze himself into the picture before Seb and Moteah could close ranks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He peered out over the sprawl of back shattered rocks leading out into the bright red desert, and after a moment of admiring the glow of day, and wondering when the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Burgeon would arrive, he blinked, and a rainbow light flashed across his vision.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He gasped and shut his eyes, but closed, his sight was flooded by that rainbow light, and it churned, and churned against his lids, forcing his eyes back open. Now his vision was a burst of color, pulsing through the spectrum\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 first red, into orange, and on, and on, and when this faded, the world was not the same as it was before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 What he saw was akin to burgeonsight, only far greater, for more than glistening surfaces he saw the fibrous iridescent light of unveiled purpose shining out from under the skin of every surface. This white-yet-spectrumed light was swimming under the sand, churning in the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow, breathing out the tower itself. Tufted strands sparkled up out of the black stone of the window-sill underneath Mandri\u8217\'92s fingers\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 every element here and was bristling with the flighty colored fibers of purpose, and these fibers took flight and were hereby joined in Mandrameen\u8217\'92s eye, for his sight was the spindle that bound them together into a thread that wound back out through his widened iris and into the world, a yarn spun tight, a continuous threading and rethreading of purpose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Threads of scintillating spectrumed light swirled out of the stomachs of the figures below\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there winding out of Ayram and Elrahet, out of the horse, out of its blue-robed rider and black-robed Riga child.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri caught his breath and realized time itself had stopped. The figures below were stuck in dynamic, limb-bent postures, seemingly fixed by the brilliant thread into a pyramidal frame\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram and Elrahet anchored bottom corners, the scribe on his white horse towered into a point. This was true purpose here, and where the purpose was strongest, the threads burned white. They keeling into the scribe, for he did not represent}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1  }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Hrkan power advantaged on a proud steed, he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 was}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  that power, and in his lap was the Riga child, the very embodiment of Hrk\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s assault on the sanctity of creation. White threads swirled around Ayram, who was not a symbol of the outland peoples, he was their paragon. Glowing brightest were all those threads connected to Elrahet, who was herself the very essence of the Sand given agency. Lying on the ground, woven into the middle of this divine tapestry, was Mazidobo, a creature constructed for the sole purpose of setting the affairs of humanity in order, and look where he was, destitute in the dirt, scarred and cowering and naked. The others looked past him as if he weren\u8217\'92t there at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri lamented the lack of materials. If he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d only had a stick of charcoal and a board he could start sketching then and there. The urge to do so was overwhelming, for the scene was pleading with him to be given its own sacred body, a painting in a frame, an object to which the iridescent threads of the moment\u8217\'92s purpose could move about the world and inject their meaning into every future moment.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sketch it out now as he saw it, details would be forgotten. After one night\u8217\'92s sleep they'd be lost forever.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He was forced instead to imprint the scene upon his mind as best he could. He kept his eye jumping from detail to detail and back again, and then back again, and again, and again, and at each stop he beheld}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1  }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 the object\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 an act beyond mere noticing. This was the artist's noticing, the lover's noticing, covetous noticing, jealous noticing, noticing to remember. Beholding not a lossless art, but what gets lost has chance of being reconstructed later.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He ran through the details again like a common sundry list.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The arc of the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow splitting the scene in half. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The coolness of color inside that shadow and its subtle, sumptuous grays, almost blue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The size disparity between Ayram and Elrahet\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 both dark and shrouded in that tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The wind flicked hem of Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s desert-bitten robe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Hrkan horse, a splendid white horse\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 white as chalk. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brushed muscles glistened in the light of the sun. It\u8217\'92s neck was as wide as Ayram\u8217\'92s shoulders. It\u8217\'92s richly braided half-flicked in anxiousness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Sitting in the brown saddle was the Hrkan scribe. His dark skin was reddened and glistening with kell oil. The trail of his blue robe was filigreed with golden leaves. His right arm cradled the black-bundled Riga with care. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo on the ground. Pale. Fly-swatted. Staring at the sky. So perfect was the staging that the warm spectral edge of the tower's penumbra cut right across his stomach. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The rest of the world\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the black tower bricks, the mush of shattered rock and sand\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 these were static things and could be ignored because they could be revisited later. It was an injustice, abstracting them out as if they weren't bound by the bristling with purpose, but Mandri knew it was more than he could manage.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He ran through the details again, though his eyelids were feeling heavy. He noticed that in all this time he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t blinked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He shouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t blink.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He should keep them open.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Notice the arc of the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that hadn't changed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram and Elrahet still stood resolute.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The horse hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even shifted it\u8217\'92s weight. It\u8217\'92d been standing on two feet this whole time. Wonderful. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He licked his lips. His mouth was dry. Burgeons have a way of doing that.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A new detail\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the white line of Hrkan soldiers hanging in the distance. It would take a large canvas to accommodate them, and a lot of paint. He twinged at the thought having to fill up so large a frame.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Should he include the light of purpose? How to paint it?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He would have to worry about that later. The details need accounting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A new detail\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spear\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 how had he missed it? The dark tip of that spear formed an unsightly tangent with the horse\u8217\'92s leather stirrup, such that the stirrup and accompanying harness seemed to sprout out from the spear\u8217\'92s haft. This element would need to be fixed. It flattened the image. Mandri could adjust the angle of the bar in Ayram\u8217\'92s hand so that it needn\u8217\'92t intersect with the stirrup at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Would it be sacrilegious to alter this image in any way?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Was the angle of the spear part of the purpose?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Did he miss anything?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Yes, there was a vulture up in the sky. Mandri wished it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t there, because a vulture circling the scene was too on the nose. People might start to think that this was all his own doing. Maybe he should remove the vulture.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No, that would be a step too far. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He would have to include the vulture.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A new detail\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 sound. And now that he noticed it, all the sounds of the scene were coming at him in one long exhale. The faint scream of the vulture. The wind whistling over the mountains. The sparkling swish of whipping sand. A shrill whistle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A whistle?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Riga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whistle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He blinked, and suddenly the scene smashed into him. He shut his eyes and yelped, for the Riga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shrill split into his head . He opened his eyes again just in time to see Obo\u8217\'92s gray Spark zipping out of his body and into the Riga\u8217\'92s mouth. Then Ayram roared, charged, and stabbed at the scribe with his spear. The scribe\u8217\'92s horse whinnied in fright, and reared as its rider was skewered up under his ribs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The call had come from behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He spun around and was surprised to find that Moteah and Seb were no longer squeezing against his shoulders, in fact, they weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even in the room. Gone, too, was the iridescent light of purpose that flooded his vision\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there was only the stark, cold interior of the tower\u8217\'92s second level, deserted save for Purl who stood waist deep in the stairwell across the room. Her face was alight with wide-eyed urgency. \u8220\'93Come on!\u8221\'94 she shouted, and then she ducked away down the stairs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri blinked in confusion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He spun back around to the window so that he could narrate for Purl the magnificence of the scene below, but Ayram was already running back towards the tower, with Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head popping out of the top of his backpack. Obo, and the Riga were gone. The Hrkan scribe lay flat on his stomach, face down into a thickening pool of his own blood. His frightened steed was charging hard into the emptiness of open desert. The Hrkan soldiers beyond had spread themselves out into a long white line\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a net of swords marching towards the tower in double time. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, shit,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Fear gripped him. He ran as fast as could towards the stairs, but each step was a chore for his limbs were thick with the lethargy left by the passing of the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He staggered down the stairs and into the darkness of the first floor hallway. Here, the true bewilderment set in and his stomach turned. His throat made to vomit\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 his chest heaved three violent times, but the only thing to come of this wrenching were stray strings of spittle.
