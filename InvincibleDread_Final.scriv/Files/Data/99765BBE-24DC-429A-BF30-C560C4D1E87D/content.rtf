\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said nobody talks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s deep voice rumbled Mandri to his core, but somehow he was not as affected as he\u8217\'92d been in the past. \u8220\'93Are you worried the Hrks will be on us today.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes went wide. \u8220\'93You can sense the Hrks?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93But the Hrks aren\u8217\'92t who you should be worried about. It\u8217\'92s the Greskalun. Something\u8217\'92s happened to them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb groaned. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can we gag the damn thing up?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take off your pack,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri obediently swung Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it, set it down, and he squatted next to it so he could get a clear look at Obo\u8217\'92s face, or maybe it was so Obo could get a clear look at his\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the man looked ready to kill.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  I can say with certainty that they are not there. However, I do think your instincts are correct\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then, from the desert, there came a sharp and roaring bleat\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Hrkan horn of war.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommm}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and all eyes raced westward, for there in the distance was a speck of man set against the glare of the desert. All that could be made of him were the familiar blue robes of a Hrkan scribe. At his side was a shorter figure wrapped in black. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A Mazidariga.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Behind them, from around the sprawling tumble of the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shattered stones, was a double-column of white robed soldiers marching in even squares.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93RUN!\u8221\'94 Ayram roared, and if that wasn\u8217\'92t enough to prod Mandri into motion, the Mazidariga\u8217\'92s warbling whistle split the air, shooting a splitting ache into his head. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He turned and ran through the accursed courtyard, weaving a route around the pilgrim poles and up the courtyard slope. There the whistle pitched into a mind splitting squeal. He dropped to his knees, cowered against the sound, and he prayed a broken prayer between gasps as he could feel his breath begin to leave him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Suddenly, the whistling faded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri could breathe again. When he slid back into the present moment he found that Ayram was carrying him out of the Riga\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s range.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Ayram saw that Mandri had come to, he set Mandri down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah ran right by them. As did Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Move!\u8221\'94 Ayram barked at Mandri, and he set off galloping.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb bumped into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back, sending them both into a tumble. They hurriedly picked themselves up and joined the others, Ayram leading, Elrahet clinging to his pack like a spider, snarling encouragement to her struggling tribe.}
