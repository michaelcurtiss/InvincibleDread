\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He was here, all of him, and as he did not end, all of him meant every thing. He was stomach and skin, fingers and toes, the wind, dust swimming in beads of rain.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But this could not be true.}

He coudl anchor no  strartegy without a word. A word was brick to build with. A stone to throw. A leap to close distance, a pull to open up. And with a word is space, to keep things separate, for without separation it would all run ajumble and the fragile order imparted on the world through language would fall apart.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both their Sparks were near and infinitely separate.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wanted to draw them closer.}
