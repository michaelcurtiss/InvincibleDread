\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Are there properties, ways things are? For example, is there, in addition to all the individual horses, the property of being a horse (equinity)? If so, how many such properties are there? Is there a property for every common noun and every adjective? A property of being red, of being ugly, of sleeping? Do some of these properties exist as separate universals? That is, is one and the same property somehow shared by everything that has that property? If so, do each of these universals inhere within many particular things, or do they in some other way explain the similarities and common characteristics of those many particular things? And are there relations, like that of being more massive than or being the same color as, that hold between or among two or more things? }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Are there things that could be called \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93facts\u8221\'94 or \u8220\'93states of affairs,\u8221\'94 such as the fact that water molecules contain hydrogen or the state of affairs of all native mammals in Australia\u8217\'92s being marsupials? }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Are there negative facts, such as the fact that there is no plant life on the sun? }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If there are facts, are they the things that, by simply existing, are responsible for making certain beliefs and statements true? Is truth itself a property, and if so, of what things? Do facts contain both particular things and universal properties? Are there merely possible facts, and if so, what are they like? What is the fundamental difference between merely possible facts and the actual ones? }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Here are four relations that seem to be among the fundamental relations of this worldly structure: the rela\'02tion between things and their properties, between wholes and their parts, between causes and effects, and between things related to each other in space and in time. We will examine all of these foundational relations in some detail. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The method of the meta\'02physician is a mixture of the testimony of pure reason, that which is prior to and independent of experience (the a priori), and the testimony of experi\'02ence itself (the a posteriori), in all its breadth and variety. Metaphysics is in this way like most other sciences. (We use the word \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93science\u8221\'94 here in a broad sense, as a label of any systematic field of knowledge.) }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What exactly the methods of metaphysics should be is one of the most hotly disputed topics among metaphysicians. In addition, some critics have disputed the very right of metaphysics to exist as a separate science. They argue that we best study the fundamental nature of reality through some more specialized discipline, such as physics, history, psychology, or linguistics. However, such thinkers do not thereby avoid doing metaphysics \endash  instead, they do metaphysics in a particular way, with an especially truncated set of data and methods }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Another methodological issue that divides metaphysicians is the question of the role that speculation or invention should play. Some metaphysicians seek simple, elegant, and unifying theories, including the postulation of novel entities and properties, while others seek metaphysics as a kind of grammar of ordinary human thought and experience, as merely making explicit what every adult human being knows. On either view, metaphysics can reach results that are surprising, even revolutionary, as the example of mathematics demonstrates: geometry and number theory are able to derive many new and useful results, starting from nothing but a few commonplaces about numbers or space. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Metaphysics is the oldest branch of philosophy, already underway in the speculations of ancient Greek-speaking thinkers, including Thales, Heraclitus, and Parmenides, in Greece, Turkey, and southern Italy in the 600s and 500s bc. Metaphysics continued to be central to the work of Plato and Aristotle, as well as to the \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93materialism\u8221\'94 of Democritus and Empedocles, who sought to answer all of the metaphysical questions in terms of the fundamental material components of things. During the Hellenistic period (between the conquests of Alexander the Great and the rise of Rome), the central focus of philosophy shifted from metaphysics to the theory and critique of knowledge (the branch of philosophy known as \u8220\'93epistemology\u8221\'94), although both the new philosophical schools of the Stoics and Epicureans and the successors of Plato and Aristotle continued in substantial metaphysical investigations }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Metaphysics regained its predominance in late antiquity and throughout the medieval periods, thanks to the pre-eminence within Western philoso\'02phy of Platonists and Aristotelians. A synthesis of the two traditions, known as \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Scholastic\u8221\'94 philosophy, provided a common framework of terminology, questions, and methods among Christians, Jews, and Moslems for over a thousand years. In the later Middle Ages (after 1300 ad), there was a grad\'02ual turn toward the study of language and toward epistemological concerns. During the Renaissance, scholars sought to return to ancient sources, includ\'02ing Plato. At the same time, these scholars recovered writings of some of the ancient materialists and Atomists, such as Democritus and Lucretius, which then began to influence the course of Western philosophy. The scientific revolution of the sixteenth century brought with it a revolt against Aristotle and Scholasticism. Metaphysical thought fragmented into several distinct streams. Some, including the German seventeenth-century philosopher Gottfried Leibniz, continued important features of the Scholastic tradition. Others turned instead to a form of Atomism about the created world, reviving Democritus\u8217\'92s idea that the material world is ultimately com\'02posed of indivisible \u8220\'93corpuscles.\u8221\'94 (We say \u8220\'93created\u8221\'94 because these thinkers believed in the existence of God.) Such Atomism had been rejected by Aristotle and his Scholastic followers in favor of a view in which all of matter is infinitely divisible. The French philosopher Ren\u233\'E9 Descartes intro\'02duced a new form of dualism, which divided reality into two domains, one purely quantitative and material (the physical), and the other qualitative and subjective (the mental). Still others moved all the way to Idealism, the view that all of reality, including the natural world, is fundamentally mental or spiritual. In fact, Idealism of one kind or another dominated European and American philosophy in the nineteenth century }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Descartes altered the course of Western philosophy for 200 years by introducing an overriding concern, amounting almost to an obsession, with attaining certainty. Descartes held that it was the responsibility of philosophers to provide a watertight answer to the challenge of the skep\'02tic, who insists upon doubting every belief that can possibly be doubted. The Cartesian philosopher seeks to build an absolutely secure and indubi\'02table set of foundations for all of our scientific and common sense beliefs. This quest for certainty necessitated a turn inward, relying on Descartes\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92 famous cogito argument: I think, therefore I am (\u8220\'93cogito ergo sum\u8221\'94 in Latin). The guiding idea was that introspection of one\u8217\'92s own subjective thoughts and feelings was immune to skeptical challenge. One might be wrong about the past or about the physical facts, but one cannot be wrong about the present contents of one\u8217\'92s own thoughts and experiences. It was this broad agreement about the subjective or \u8220\'93phenomenological\u8221\'94 method that gave the advantage to various forms of Idealism in the mid- to late nineteenth centuries }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With the loss of the Scholastic framework, the rise of the success and prestige of experimental science, and the premium placed on certainty, metaphysics faced a series of challenges. A number of significant thinkers began to sound a new note in the late eighteenth century, raising doubts about the right of meta\'02physics to stand as a science among other fields of knowledge. David Hume, the great philosopher of Scotland, stands out as pre-eminent among these new anti\'02metaphysicians. Near the end of his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Hume issues his famous challenge to the value of metaphysics: If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion. (Hume 1777: Section XII, Part III, 165 }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hume\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s assault had a deep effect on a younger German metaphysician, Immanuel Kant. Kant described Hume as having \u8220\'93awakened\u8221\'94 him from his \u8220\'93dogmatic slumber.\u8221\'94 In response, Kant engineered what he called \u8220\'93a Copernican revolution\u8221\'94 in philosophy. Henceforth, those following Kant would not seek to understand things as they are in themselves but only as they are for us. Post-Kantian philosophers examine how things appear to us, and how the structure of our own sensibility and understanding shape those appearances. Kant believed that a new, more sober and restrained metaphys\'02ics could result from following this subject-focused and phenomenological method }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If Kant\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s response to Hume constituted some sort of victory for metaphys\'02ics, it proved to be a Pyrrhic one. If we assume that human thought and meaning cannot reach beyond the range of sensory appearances (the empiri\'02cal domain), then the usual empirical sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, and so on) would seem to exhaust the possibilities for novel discoveries or systematic theorizing, leaving nothing for metaphysicians to do. The effort to limit science to what can be empirically verified came to be known as \u8220\'93positivism.\u8221\'94 In addition, historical and anthropological research indicated that human experience is more variegated and fluid than Kant had sup\'02posed, suggesting that traditional metaphysics be replaced by cultural or historical studies }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The positivists of the nineteenth century were succeeded by the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle in the early twentieth century, who insisted that metaphysics (along with other non-empirical fields like ethics, theology, or aesthetics) were nonsensical, since their propositions could not be empirically verified. The Vienna Circle, in turn, influenced Anglo-American philosophy through the early work of Ludwig Wittgenstein and through the Cambridge philosophers Bertrand Russell and Frank Ramsey. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The complementary movement toward historicism and cultural relativity culminated in the work of Georg Hegel in Germany. Hegel described a pro\'02cess by which the true metaphysical theory evolves over time, in response to cultural and political factors. Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche, Michel Foucault, and others in the late nineteenth and twentieth century drew the conclusion that any attempt to escape the limitations of one\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s time or one\u8217\'92s own personal biases, as would be required by the pursuit of metaphysical truth, is futile and should be abandoned. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In America, the pragmatists offered a new source of opposition to meta\'02physics. William James proposed that \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93truth\u8221\'94 should be identified with \u8220\'93whatever works.\u8221\'94 Pragmatism thus renders many traditional metaphysical theories and disputes irrelevant, since metaphysical truth can often seem to have no immediate \u8220\'93cash value.\u8221\'94 Thus, pragmatic impulses in philosophy further undermined any interest in metaphysical questions }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Some philosophers who had been part of the logical positivist movement came to be dissatisfied with the positivists\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92 focus on individual and subjective sense experience. They came to see that science, in order to reach results that are publicly verifiable, must primarily pertain to the natural world, the world beyond the individual human mind. At the same time, the Cartesian epistemo\'02logical foundation was crumbling. Otto Neurath rejected Descartes\u8217\'92 fixation on certainty, arguing that our theory of the world is like a raft in the middle of the ocean: we can try to make incremental improvements from within the raft, but we can never hope to find solid ground outside it on which to build for it a new foundation. Further, post-positivist philosophers wanted to maintain the unity of the natural sciences, and they saw fundamental physics as the unifying framework within which all other scientific disciplines could be constructed. These \u8220\'93physicalists,\u8221\'94 including Neurath, Alfred Tarski, and Willard van Orman Quine, looked to modern mathematics and physics for answers to traditional metaphysical questions, rejecting the legitimacy of any metaphysical question that could not be subjected to investigation through the scientific method as exemplified by mathematical physics. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In summary, metaphysics faced opposition from five sources in the early twentieth century: }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 1. The subjectivist and phenomenological turn (in response to Cartesian skepticism) }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 2. The positivist challenge }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 3. The relativist and historicist challenges}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 4. The pragmatist challenge}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 5. The physicalist challenge }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Given the breadth and depth of this opposition to metaphysics, the late twentieth century has been the occasion of one of the most remarkable reversals in the history of thought: the renaissance of metaphysics in Anglo\'02American philosophy. The need to overcome such intense resistance has forced modern metaphysicians to rise to a level of sophistication that is almost unprecedented, as well as to draw on all of the best of the 2000-year tradition of metaphysical reflection from the past. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Physicalism eventually evolved into a new materialist school of metaphys\'02ical thought, with its principal representatives in England and Australia. Both Quine and the Australian metaphysicians helped to shape the thinking of the most wide-ranging and influential metaphysician of the twentieth century, Princeton\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s David K. Lewis. You may notice that Lewis\u8217\'92s work is mentioned in every chapter of this book. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 We turn now to the world side of the Correspondence Theory of Truth. The question that will occupy us is this: What, exactly, must a proposition corre\'02spond to in order to be true? For it is clear that the talk of corresponding to the world should not be taken to mean that true propositions must corre\'02spond to the whole world. Consider, for example, the proposition that snow is white. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not the overall state of the world that matters to the truth of this proposition; it is just the color of snow that matters. H }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Picking up on this idea, philosophers like Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and G. E. Moore defended the idea that there are truthmakers, that is, parts of the world in virtue of which propositions are true. More carefully, we define truthmakers in this way: x is a truthmaker for the prop\'02osition p if and only if (i) p must be true if x exists, and (ii) if x exists and p\~is true, the p must be true at least in part because x exists (or in virtue of  the existence of x). The truthmaker for a proposition is that bit of the world which makes that proposition true. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Stage 1. The Correspondence Theory of Truth is very plausible. For if it is true, it explains why we turn to an investigation of the way the world is when we\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re interested to determine whether a given sentence is true or false. That is, when the truth of a sentence is in question, we seem to begin with our knowledge of the meaning of the sentence, and then we undertake to determine whether the world is the sort of place that is a match for that meaning. When there is the right sort of match, we count the sentence true; when there isn\u8217\'92t the right sort of match, we count the sentence false. For example, suppose we were wondering about the truth of the following sen\'02tence: \u8220\'93Fewer than 90% of the (single-family, detached) homes inside the Austin city limits are owner-occupied.\u8221\'94 If we were unable to get testimonial evidence about whether this sentence is true or false (maybe Googling failed us in this case), what would we do? The answer is almost too obvious to state: we would have to go about producing an inventory of the occupiers and owners of all the homes inside the Austin city limits, and then we\u8217\'92d do some simple calculations. (No doubt this would be time-consuming and tedious, but the strategy isn\u8217\'92t complicated!) The Correspondence Theory can explain this quite readily. We know what the relevant sentence means, and so we know what the world would have to be like in order for the sen\'02tence to be true. The meaning of the sentence has to match the state of the world. That\u8217\'92s just the Correspondence Theory. This is our inchoate way of understanding truth. Let\u8217\'92s suppose, at least provisionally, that it\u8217\'92s true. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 So we have a three-step argument for the existence of truthmakers, that is, for Classical Truthmaker Theory, from the Correspondence Theory of Truth. The chunk of the world to which sentences correspond when they are true satisfies both clauses of the definition of truthmakers }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What may not be so obvious, however, is that different theories may describe the world in exactly the same way by using different terminology. One obvious way this can happen is if the theories are formulated using dif\'02ferent languages. The differences can be subtler, though. Different theories in the same language can differ with respect to the propositions or concepts they use to express the theory. For example, consider one theory formulated using the concept \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93bachelor\u8221\'94 and a second theory formulated without that concept but with the concepts \u8220\'93unmarried,\u8221\'94 \u8220\'93adult,\u8221\'94 and \u8220\'93male.\u8221\'94 The first theory, but not the second, could imply the sentence \u8220\'93There are bachelors,\u8221\'94 though the second could imply the sentence \u8220\'93There are unmarried adult males.\u8221\'94 While these theories use different terminology, there doesn\u8217\'92t seem to be any substantive difference in the way that they describe the world }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 An example from the philosophy of time (see Chapter\~8 for more) may help. One important dispute about time is whether Presentism or Eternalism accurately describes the world. Very roughly, a Presentist is someone who believes that the only things that exist are those things that exist at the pre\'02sent moment. Put differently, Presentism is just the view that only the present exists. Eternalism, on the other hand, is (again roughly) the view that things that exist in the past and future are just as real as things that exist in the present. The past and future are no less real than the present; there is nothing special, from an ontological point of view, about the present. Presentists and Eternalists agree that there are now no dinosaurs or human outposts on Mars, but disagree about whether there are dinosaurs and Martian outposts. Presentists think there are none of these things, while Eternalists think there are (though they would hasten to emphasize that they don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t now exist). Presentists have a problem making sense of the truth of ordinary sen\'02tences like, \u8220\'93There used to be dinosaurs.\u8221\'94 They cannot say, and Eternalists can say, that there are these things, dinosaurs, that only exist at times tem\'02porally prior to the present. For that is to commit to the existence of dino\'02saurs, which is just what they don\u8217\'92t want to do! If there are dinosaurs, then dinosaurs exist, even if only in the past. This problem is notorious for Presentists, and when faced with it, some Presentists have made the follow\'02ing sort of speech: \u8220\'93Here\u8217\'92s the deal. These past tense statements ought to be understood as involv\'02ing an \u8216\'91irreducible tense operator\u8217\'92. By that, I mean that the true form of \u8216\'91There used to be dinosaurs\u8217\'92 is this: WAS(Dinosaurs exist), where WAS(p) is true just in case p was the case. (We can say something similar for future tense, involv\'02ing a WILL-BE operator.) However, propositions involving irreducible tense operators don\u8217\'92t commit you to believing in the things that you would be committed to if you asserted the proposition without that tense operator. One can believe that WAS(Dinosaurs exist) is true without believing in the existence of dinosaurs. After all, everyone has to believe that there are operators like this: Folks can believe there\u8217\'92s a Fountain of Youth without there being this thing, the Fountain of Youth, that they believe in. Like WAS, BELIEVES is a non-factive or opaque operator: one that does not permit the exporting to reality of things that exist only within its scope. }

\par\plain 
\par\plain {Atomic Truthmaker Theory  pg.43}
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Atomic truthmaker theory accounts for the truth of non-atomic sentences in ways one might expect. A conjunction \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93a and b\u8221\'94 (where \u8220\'93a\u8221\'94 and \u8220\'93b\u8221\'94 are atomic truths) is true just in case the sentence \u8220\'93a\u8221\'94 has a truthmaker and the sentence \u8220\'93b\u8221\'94 has a truthmaker. A disjunction \u8220\'93a or b\u8221\'94 is true just in case either the sentence \u8220\'93a\u8221\'94 has a truthmaker or the sentence \u8220\'93b\u8221\'94 has a truthmaker. (Matters aren\u8217\'92t so clear in the case of conditionals \u8220\'93if a then b\u8221\'94; see Chapter\~ 3 for discussion, though one not structured around the issue of truthmaking per se.) Negative sentences, like negative existentials and ordinary negations (\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not the case that a\u8221\'94 or \u8220\'93o is not-F\u8221\'94) are a bit trickier. Consider a negation \u8220\'93Not-a,\u8221\'94 where \u8220\'93a\u8221\'94 is atomic. The ground of the truth of \u8220\'93Not-a\u8221\'94 is that \u8220\'93a\u8221\'94 fails to have a truthmaker. It is the lack of a truthmaker for \u8220\'93a\u8221\'94 that grounds the truth of \u8220\'93Not-a.\u8221\'94 Put another way, any truthmaker for \u8220\'93a\u8221\'94 is going to make \u8220\'93Not-a\u8221\'94 false, and so \u8220\'93Not-a\u8221\'94 is true not because it has a truthmaker but because it lacks a falsitymaker (that is, there is no existing thing that makes it false) }
\par\plain 
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Interestingly, if Atomic Truthmaker Theory is true, all truths must \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93weakly supervene\u8221\'94 on facts about which atomic propositions are true and\~false. Weak supervenience can be defined as follows: A class of propo\'02sitions A weakly supervenes on a class of propositions B if and only if you cannot change the truth-value (truth or falsity) of a proposition in A with\'02out changing the truth-value of at least one proposition in B. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {The idea is that the B-truths fix the A-truths: you couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t get different A-truths without changing the B-truths. For example, facts about clouds (A-truths) are fixed by facts about water molecules in the sky (B-truths), and facts about beaches (A-truths) are fixed by facts about grains of sand (B-truths), and some argue that facts about mental states (A-truths) are fixed by facts about brain states (B-truths). In each case, the former set of facts weakly supervenes on the latter. (See Section\~ 9.4 for more details about supervenience. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Atomic truthmaker theory maintains that the atomic truths fix all the truths, and so in that sense all truths supervene on the atomic ones. Once one settles the truthmaker facts, one has thereby settled which atomic propositions are true and false. But thereby, one will have fixed all the truths. One will not be able to get a difference in overall truth without a difference in atomic truth. For example, the conjunctive truths, in the manner articulated above, supervene on the atomic truths. Once one settles the atomic truths, the conjunctive truths fall into place. One cannot change the latter without changing the former. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain 
\par\plain {As we have seen, one of the fundamental motivations for Classical Truthmaker Theory is the Correspondence Theory of Truth. A number of philosophers, however, have argued that the Correspondence Theory is false, and that we should instead opt for Deflationism about truth.10 According to the Correspondence Theory, and implicit in our discussion so far, is the idea that the predicate \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93is true\u8221\'94 expresses a property had by cer\'02tain things, like sentences, propositions, and beliefs. Truth is, on this under\'02standing, like colors, shapes, sizes, natural kinds (like human, dog, and gold), and other features. There really is a property of being true. According to Deflationism, on the other hand, the predicate \u8220\'93is true\u8221\'94 does not express a property.11 To say that something is true is just a roundabout way of say\'02ing the something itself. To say, \u8220\'93\u8216\'91Snow is white\u8217\'92 is true,\u8221\'94 is just to say, \u8220\'93Snow is white,\u8221\'94 and to say, \u8220\'93\u8216\'91Eight numbers the planets\u8217\'92 is true,\u8221\'94 is just to say, \u8220\'93Eight numbers the planets.\u8221\'94 In this way, predications of truth and fal\'02sity aren\u8217\'92t about correspondence at all. They are simply a different way to endorse an ordinary claim. Importantly, though Deflationists are anti-realists about the property of being true, they can be as realist as they like about any other things, from attributes like color and shape, to natural kinds, to the past and future, to moral facts, to non-actual possibilities, and on and on. Deflationism simply doesn\u8217\'92t speak to the reality or otherwise of these things; it is only a view about the predicate \u8220\'93is true\u8221\'94 and the property of being true. An interesting consequence of Deflationism is that true propositions do not, in virtue of being true, have anything in common with one another. Because of this, truth cannot play a part in metaphysical or causal explanations. And truth cannot be a part of causal laws or other laws of nature. }
