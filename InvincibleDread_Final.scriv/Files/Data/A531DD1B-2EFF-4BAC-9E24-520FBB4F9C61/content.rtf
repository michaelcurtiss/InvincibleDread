\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Although very good and useful things can be found on the Internet, we know as well that it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a place where irresponsible anonymity and shameless animosity regrettably compete, embracing perverse calumniation. The One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Palmarian Church, without provoking it, is a victim of these kind of attacks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 The Palmarian Church is fallaciously and cunningly attacked by way of her members and her doctrine. Things are said of her Popes that are painful to repeat, in particular regarding Saint Gregory XVII the Very Great, the first Pope whose See was in El Palmar de Troya. The falseness of those infamous lies can begin to be suspected simply noticing that, with refined cunning, they all make reference to alleged incidents that in themselves are unverifiable. Moreover, Saint Gregory XVII \endash  in the same way as his first predecessor, Saint Peter I the Very Great, who didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t permit even as Pope that in the Gospel his errors and sins be concealed \endash  never hid his true sins and defects: whoever wishes to know them has only to read his twenty-seventh Pontifical Document or his heavenly vision from 21st of January 2001.}
