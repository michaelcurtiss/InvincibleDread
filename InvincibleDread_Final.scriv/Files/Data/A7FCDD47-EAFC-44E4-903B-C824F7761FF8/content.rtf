Wittgenstein lists the following as examples of language-games: \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Giving orders, and obeying them\u8221\'94; \u8220\'93describing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements\u8221\'94; \u8220\'93constructing an object from a description (a drawing)\u8221\'94; \u8220\'93reporting an event\u8221\'94; \u8220\'93speculating about an event."}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations#cite_note-:1-5"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0\super [}}{\f0\fs24\b0\ul\ulc0\super\cf4 5]}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~The famous example is the meaning of the word "game". We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, and "war games". These are all different uses of the word "games". Wittgenstein also gives the example of "Water!", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game in which it is used. Another way Wittgenstein makes the point is that the word "water" has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as a code by members of a secret society.}{ }

\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i0 "When they (my elders) named some object, and accordingly moved towards something, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was called by the sound they uttered when they meant to point it out. Their intention was shewn by their bodily movements, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the expression of the face, the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the tone of voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting, or avoiding something. Thus, as I heard words repeatedly used in their proper places in various sentences, I gradually learnt to understand what objects they signified; and after I had trained my mouth to form these signs, I used them to express my own desires."  - Augustine}

\par\plain \f2\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f2\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i0 That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours. Let us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is right. The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with buildingstones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words "block", "pillar", "slab", "beam". A calls them out;\hich\f2 \emdash \loch\f2 B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call.\hich\f2 \emdash \loch\f2 \hich\f2 \emdash \loch\f2 Conceive this as a complete primitive language. 3. Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not everything that we call language is this system. And one has to say this in many cases where the question arises "Is this an appropriate description or not?" The answer is: "Yes, it is appropriate, but only for this narrowly circumscribed region, not for the whole of what you were claiming to describe." It is as if someone were to say: "A game consists in moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules . . ."\hich\f2 \emdash \loch\f2 and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others. You can make your definition correct by expressly restricting it to those games. }

\par\plain 
\par\plain {An important part of the training will consist in the teacher's pointing to the objects, directing the child's attention to them, and at the same time uttering a word; for instance, the word "slab" as he points to that shape. }
\par\plain {This ostensive teaching of words can be said to establish an association between the word and the thing. But what does this mean?
