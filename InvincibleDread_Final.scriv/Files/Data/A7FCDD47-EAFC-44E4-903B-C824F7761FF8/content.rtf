I\u8217\'92ll stand behind Russell and Moore and the other early analytic philosophers.. The aim of philosophy is to give a picture of the whole of reality, the fundamental things in it, and the most important ways in which those things are related to one another.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Of course this is a blank cheque, because you want to know what \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91generality\u8217\'92 means, or what it means to be \u8216\'91fundamental\u8217\'92, what are important was of being related, what does it mean to be related. This is a rough shape for what things should turn out to be, and it distinguishes philosophy from science in the following fashion - in contrast with science, philosophy concerns itself with the fact that such and such are the *only* kinds of things there are. Because of its general character, philosophy also enters into question of exclusion, about what there isn\u8217\'92t in reality.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The question of realtions is one of the most important issues in philosophy, as most other things turn on it.

How is any of this possible? If order}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 isn't possible then we will have to condemn what science and common sense say about the world to the bin of appearances and self-contradictions.

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 we are far more certain of the findings of science and common sense than of the validity and soundness of any philosophical argument deployed against them. The reasoning here was later developed by}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 moore um in his defense of common sense realism about the external world he famously offered to refute the skeptic by holding up his hands and saying here are hands and he thought that namely here or two external external world items and he thought there was no philosophical argument you}

A relational proposition may be symbolized by A or B where R is the relation and A and B are the terms. okay now we get the idea of direction that is to say it's a characteristic of a relation of two terms that proceeds so to speak from one end A to the other B and this is what we call the sense of the relation and as is we shall find the source of order and series in the world. Things can come from first, second, and third, is that there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a direction involved, applying first to A, and then to B.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Avoid the fate of idealist philosophers, to maximise our exposure of the human mind to what there is in reality, not hide behind the veil of apperances.

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His second theory was that judgement is a multiple relation. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a relation which doesn\u8217\'92t take you between a subject and a single proposition, but takes you between the subject and all the things that intuitively speaking that proposition is about.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 1910 paper - nature of truth and falsehood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A loves B. This consists of a relation of the person judging to a and love and b. i.e. to the terms A and B and the relation \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91loves\u8217\'92, but the judgment is not the same as the judgement b loves a, thus the relation must not be abstractly before the mind but must be before it as proceeding from A to B rather than from B to A.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The corresponding complex which is to make our judgements true consists of a related b by the relation which was before us in our judgmenet. The idea is, instead of hte mind simply embracing a proposition you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re to imagine the cognitive tentacles reaching out from your mind and then touching on the individual elements of a proposition rather as you might touch on the notes of a keyboard to play a melody. It\u8217\'92s the critical order in which the mind reaches out and touches upon the things it\u8217\'92s thinking about that constitutes as being a proposition. And what you think is true when the way in which the judgment relation touches upon the elements that you\u8217\'92re thinking about corresponds to the way in which those things are actually arranged in the world. So the idea is that the fact that Subject judges in this way has enough unity to render a truth valuable, but not so much as to make a mystery of the difference between true and false propositions.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 So by thinking about truth as an extrinsic property of our judgement rather than intrinsic feature we can see how we can judge false propositions well in order to get the theory precise. What you have to do is explain what it means for the cognitive tentacles to touch upon the elements of a proposition in the right order in the right way and to conceive of the relation proceeding from a to b. What does it mean to hold a relation before the mind is proceeding from a and b, well that was where russell devoted his attention. Then Wittgenstein arrived on the scene. So here\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s the anti-hero of our story. Russell was writing about these views in his theory of knowledge manuscript which he abanded as a result of criticism\u8217\'92s in 1913. }

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Wittgenstein develops this discussion of games into the key notion of a\~language-game. For Wittgenstein, his use of the term language-game "is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a life-form."}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\super\cf1 [5]}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \~A central feature of language-games is that language is used in context and cannot be understood outside of that context. Wittgenstein lists the following as examples of language-games: \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Giving orders, and obeying them\u8221\'94; \u8220\'93describing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements\u8221\'94; \u8220\'93constructing an object from a description (a drawing)\u8221\'94; \u8220\'93reporting an event\u8221\'94; \u8220\'93speculating about an event."}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\super\cf1 [5]}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \~The famous example is the meaning of the word "game". We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, and "war games". These are all different uses of the word "games". Wittgenstein also gives the example of "Water!", which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game in which it is used. Another way Wittgenstein makes the point is that the word "water" has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as a code by members of a secret society. }

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The essential point of this exercise is often missed. Wittgenstein's point is not that it is impossible to define "game", but that\~even if we don't have a definition, we can still use the word successfully }

Their intention was shewn by their bodily movements, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the expression of the face, the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the tone of voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting, or avoiding something. Thus, as I heard words repeatedly used in their proper places in various sentences, I gradually learnt to understand what objects they signified; and after I had trained my mouth to form these signs, I used them to express my own desires."  - Augustine}

\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours. Let us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is right. The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with buildingstones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words "block", "pillar", "slab", "beam".

Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not everything that we call language is this system. And one has to say this in many cases where the question arises "Is this an appropriate description or not?" The answer is: "Yes, it is appropriate, but only for this narrowly circumscribed region, not for the whole of what you were claiming to describe." It is as if someone were to say: "A game consists in moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules . . ."\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others. You can make your definition correct by expressly restricting it to those games. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 An important part of the training will consist in the teacher's pointing to the objects, directing the child's attention to them, and at the same time uttering a word; for instance, the word "slab" as he points to that shape. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This ostensive teaching of words can be said to establish an association between the word and the thing. But what does this mean? Well, it may mean various things; but one very likely thinks first of all that a picture of the object comes before the child's mind when it hears the word. But now, if this does happen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 is it the purpose of the word?\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Yes, it may be the purpose.\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 I can imagine such a use of words }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But if the ostensive teaching has this effect,\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 am I to say that it effects an understanding of the word? Don't you understand the call "Slab!" if you act upon it in such-and-such a way?\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Doubtless the ostensive teaching helped to bring this about; but only together with a particular training. With different training the same ostensive teaching of these words would have effected a quite different understanding. "I set the brake up by connecting up rod and lever."\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Yes, given the whole of the rest of the mechanism. Only in conjunction with that is it a brake-lever, and separated from its support it is not even a lever; it may be anything, or nothing }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games "language-games" and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game. And the processes of naming the stones and of repeating words after someone might also be called language-games. Think of much of the use of words in games like ring-a-ring-a-roses. I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven, the "language-game". }

Think of the tools in a tool-box: there is a hammer, pliers, a saw, a screw-driver, a rule, a glue-pot, glue, nails and screws.\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 The functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these objects. (And in both cases there are similarities.) Of course, what confuses us is the uniform appearance of words when we hear them spoken or meet them in script and print. For their application is not presented to us so clearly. Especially when we are doing philosophy 1 }

But one is the handle of a crank which can be moved continuously (it regulates the opening of a valve); another is the handle of a switch, which has only two effective positions, it is either off or on; a third is the handle of a brake-lever, the harder one pulls on it, the harder it brakes; a fourth, the handle of a pump: it has an effect only so long as it is moved to and fro }

(It might be, of course, that we wanted to distinguish the words of language (8) from words 'with\'02out meaning' such as occur in Lewis CarrolPs poems, or words like "Lilliburlero" in songs.) 14. Imagine someone's saying: "All tools serve to modify some\'02thing. Thus the hammer modifies the position of the nail, the saw the shape of the board, and so on."\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 And what is modified by the rule, the glue-pot, the nails?\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 "Our knowledge of a thing's length, the tempera\'02ture of the glue, and the solidity of the box."\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Would anything be gained by this assimilation of expressions?\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0  }
