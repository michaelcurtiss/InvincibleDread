\pard\plain \sl216\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Eustoma exaltatum is my favorite plant. It has several common names. Seaside Gentian is what I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve heard. It is a Florida native. It is a resilient plant. I\u8217\'92ve seen it grow in difficult places, in chunks of asphalt, in sand, in salty soil. I\u8217\'92ve even seen it withstand a bit of salt-water flooding. But it needs full sun to really flourish, and when it gets it, I\u8217\'92ve seen it grow as tall as my bellybutton.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 I am compelled to stop and stare at them. They don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t need to be flowering, because their stalks are this beautiful blueish grey-green which makes them stand out amongst everything else. Look up photos and you\u8217\'92ll see what I\u8217\'92m talking about. The plant looks ethereal when set against brown and green grasses.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And then when flowering, of course, it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s the most beautiful plant I have ever seen. I feel I have a sort of connection to it, because it was there at a time when I needed to see it. That at least explains why everyone else drives right on by them, but I can\u8217\'92t stop staring. I\u8217\'92ve mentioned before that the city feels no shame in classifying the thing as weed and mowing them down, which blows my mind. I mean, I don\u8217\'92t understand how it\u8217\'92s possible for me to see that much beauty in a thing that the rest of the world just sort of passes by, or god forbid, cuts down.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then I get to thinking that maybe I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92m guilty of the same thing, that there are more beautiful plants out there that I\u8217\'92ve passed by out of sheer ignorance. Well, I know I\u8217\'92ve looked. I have looked. And you know, I don\u8217\'92t think that\u8217\'92s true. Sure, lower-case-t \u8216\'91truth\u8217\'92 is just a compliment we pay to a sentence that\u8217\'92s working for us, but I really don\u8217\'92t think that\u8217\'92s true.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That Eustoma exaltatum letter was my first idea (after the idea/joke of showing up with flowers and chocolate). It was made so that it could be ignored. Now, ordinarily, I would have crumpled up that letter and thrown it in the trash. It sucks. I mean really, who unsubtly compares a girl to a choice flower these days. This isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the 1800s. Then I thought, you know Katherine likes to see the process. I respect that. The process is way more interesting than But I kept it, because you seem to get a kick out of seeing the process of how I go about things. }
