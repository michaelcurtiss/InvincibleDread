An ancient tribe called the Solgruin asked Solraheen to split the Goree mountain so that the overland journey east would be made easier. Solraheen, walked to the mountains and climbed the tallest peak where he stomped on the Goree\u8217\'92s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.}

This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed and so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.\u8221\'94}
\par\pard\plain \tx1123\tx1685\tx2246\tx2794\tx3355\tx3917\tx4478\tx5040\tx5602\tx6163\tx6725\fi720\ri-720\sl288\slmult1\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 For Mandri, this story justified the act of ripping up a painting to spite a client, just as Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d only ever done it once, but what a glorious once it was. He\u8217\'92d spent a week and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who\u8217\'92d commissioned it said she wouldn\u8217\'92t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting\u8217\'92s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the barbarian King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn\u8217\'92t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would go to her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a proto-Hrkan Lord on the richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, \u8220\'93That looks just like your Pookum!\u8221\'94, and the woman would say, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s because it is my Pookum!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with resentment. As his fingers tore the canvas an unfamiliar euphoria coursed through his veins. He tore the painting completely in half, right there in front of that cursed woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 wrong }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 with you!?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have killed that woman, just as Solraheen killed all those who journeyed the Goree Pass. Well, He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t kill them, He cursed them. Curses, it turns out, does little to dissuade people. After all, here they were, the Ayramun, Mandrameen himself, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 According to Moto, the Greskalun made their home inside the pass itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Either there was no curse and the story was only a story, or maybe the Solitants were right about not taking the surface meaning too seriously. Or, and this is what Moto believed, the curse was only meant for the Solgruin. Everyone else could do what they want.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, further out was the black sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib from spreading out of control. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spite became, for the ground under Mandri\u8217\'92s feet grew uneven, and rocks popped up out of the sand like roots to trip him. The Goree\u8217\'92s walls grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground. These cracks had long been rubbed smooth, an eon of blasting sand had rounded their edges, pillowed the seams, giving them the appearance of bloated infection. Mandri\u8217\'92s bright mood dimmed at the sight of them\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was quite apparent that the place was truly cursed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Soon the Goree Pass was sighted in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Ayram informed the rest that this splinter was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the breadth of the pass\u8217\'92s mouth, protecting against ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now, and had done so for centuries.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through a debris field from a mountain cleft exploding.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scattered boulders were indeed a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been indescribable. It would have been unbelievable if it weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t Solraheen who\u8217\'92d done it. Mandri imagined Solraheen standing up there on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the dusty wind, and, well, a god such as He wouldn\u8217\'92t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe to set the mountains quaking and bursting, sending stones the size of houses miles into the air. A long sliver of the mountain reduced to rubble and vomited out onto the desert plain in the blink of an eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Most of the Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram walked with a bowed head, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his pack and the long journey bearing on him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl was ashen-faced and whispering to herself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was a spring in Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s step, like his feet had found their home.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet was the same as she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d always been\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 angry and quiet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Meanwhile Seb was chewing his borcandi spines so hard that his jaw was going stiff and he had to sort of rub them between his teeth instead of chew. And the man wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t paying attention to where he was spitting his juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, he hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto\u8217\'92s heel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do that again,\u8221\'94 Moto said, \u8220\'93And you\u8217\'92ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb lifted himself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you disrespect me like that,\u8221\'94 said Seb. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Me disrespect }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You threaten a man with his kneecaps, that\u8217\'92s disrespectful.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You spit on my foot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was an accident!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And I\u8217\'92m telling you, if you do it again, I\u8217\'92m going to\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quiet!\u8221\'94 Ayram barked. He doubled back to make sure he was listened to.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Both men\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s backs went stiff.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram said sternly, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nobody talks from here on out. Except Elrahet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So the Hrks are coming today?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said nobody talks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s deep voice rumbled Mandri to his core, but Obo was not so affected. He added, from behind Mandri\u8217\'92s ear, \u8220\'93Oh, the Hrks will be on us today, I\u8217\'92m sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can sense the Hrks?\u8221\'94 Ayram asked, startled. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can, but the Hrks aren\u8217\'92t who you should be worried about. It\u8217\'92s the Greskalun. Something\u8217\'92s happened to them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The creature seeks to stall us,\u8221\'94 Elrahet grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grave visage lingered on Obo a moment, then he muttered a curse under his breath and he set off again towards the pass, this time more cautiously, peeking out from behind boulders, and climbing upon them to look for the Hrks behind them. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. He could not shake this foreboding feeling that this once living mountain was now dead and rotted through. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock because they were as friable as the hardtack Mandri was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against a boulder, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the stone were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread. And then there was the black tower itself, poking out like a splinter stuck in a wound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 An uneasiness had settled in amongst them ever since Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grim pronouncement. Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t worried as much about the Greskalun, for him, his fear stemmed from the tower. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And It was black. No bright Spark ever builds in black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And the central task of a monument to some grave sin is to look like it doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t belong. The tall spike of a tower did this quite comfortably.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri thought he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d die on the approach, for the brittle rock slopes threatened to come galloping down upon him every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn\u8217\'92t possible to keep away from the rocks. Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by their invisible Hrkan pursuit. He pioneered a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo without seeing him, but he didn\u8217\'92t ask.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He kept quiet because that was the rule.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Everyone kept quiet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Whatever cheer they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d mustered for making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof that Obo was wrong about \u8216\'91something happening\u8217\'92 to the Greskalun. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then the Goree pass opened up before them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle, and to either side, black stone walls sprawled across the red-stone gap. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mouth, though the gate in the tower\u8217\'92s base was wide open. There were no lights in the tower\u8217\'92s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that Obo was right\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 something had happened to the Greskalun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off towards the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe they all retreated into their temple.\u8221\'94 Seb was so stressed out that he was chewing two spines at once and his words were garbled by a slosh of spit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Retreated from what?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 Seb said defensively.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe it's pox,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes went bright with revelation. \u8220\'93That could be it! It\u8217\'92s happened before, right? That\u8217\'92s what they do whene the pox gets on them, they run back into their temple and stay put \u8216\'91til it all blows over.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s the sign of fire?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked. \u8220\'93If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think we should go in,\u8221\'94 Purl said. She then stated the obvious, \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s cursed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You guys know the story about how the Goree Pass was created, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, we know,\u8221\'94 Moteah groaned.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wasn\u8217\'92t sure. It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since forever.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not cursed,\u8221\'94 said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 As if to prove him wrong, a black vulture, which had been hiding in the shadow of the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pointed roof, squawked and took flight. It spread its long wings and soared, caught a thermal, and rode it high up into the air, where it wheeled around in circles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s only a bird,\u8221\'94 Ayram muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Two more vultures melted out of the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow and wheeled up into the air. They joined their brother\u8217\'92s holding pattern, and their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri\u8217\'92s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn\u8217\'92t know any better he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen\u8217\'92s ancient curse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s turn to say it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The place is cursed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If curses worked,\u8221\'94 said Seb, \u8220\'93Then the Hrkan Lords woulda choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The mood was affecting even Ayram. The strongest men are perhaps the most frightened by magic. A curse from a god was not something he could kill with his spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion of his control.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The giant marched over to Mandri, and Mandri flinched, fearing he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d done or said something wrong. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take off your pack,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled. Mandri did as he was told and swung Obo\u8217\'92s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it, set it down, and he squatted next to it so he could get a good clear look at Obo\u8217\'92s face. He said, \u8220\'93Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?\u8221\'94 There was no room in his tone for games.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram growled a disbelieving grunt. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. I know you outland pokes abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you are asking me if there\u8217\'92s a small army of Hrkan Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. But I do think your instincts are correct\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb spat in Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s general direction. The loogie just missed Obo\u8217\'92s litter and splatted harmlessly in the dirt. \u8220\'93Them Greskalun could still be those mountains. Pox, or drought, it don\u8217\'92t matter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That\u8217\'92s what they do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe,\u8221\'94 said Moteah.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Or maybe not,\u8221\'94 Obo said, suggesting he knew better. Instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter, his elbows stretching his swaddling fabric as he twisted around. Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t help but chuckle at the sight of it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he looked like a toddler trying to roll over, trying to get comfortable for a nap. With effort, Obo poked the stub of his arm up and out of the neck of his tightly wrapped robe, and he used it to widen the opening so that he could stick his whole handless arm through. Once done, he reached out behind him and nudged something into view. It was a bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where did you get that?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was sitting here,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93Not the first one I\u8217\'92ve seen. Honestly, I\u8217\'92m surprised you all missed it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo pushed the bone out before him, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93Is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb stomped over and nudged it with his toe. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You find one bone and you think them dead? One bone on the ground? A bone on the ground ain\u8217\'92t unusual. Where else are you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you\u8217\'92d have something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let the Mazid speak,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo nudged the bone so that it flipped over. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is an unusual fracture, isn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He rubbed his pale, nubby wrist along the length of the fracture. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a clean fracture, it was a splintered fracture which stretched almost along the whole length of it, leaving the upturned half to look like an open tube.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It's a broken bone,\u8221\'94 Seb said, unimpressed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that\u8217\'92s how bones naturally break. A break like this\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it\u8217\'92s not likely to happen accidentally.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing paws the bone looked like a child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. He said, \u8220\'93If your point is that this person was killed, that\u8217\'92s not unusual.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought violence wasn\u8217\'92t allowed in the pass,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re not in the pass,\u8221\'94 Ayram said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo shrugged and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whoever it was, however they died, that\u8217\'92s not what is significant. This was no simple killing. A blow to the leg would not crack the bone like that. It }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 could}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  happen, but the chances of that occurring are exceedingly slim.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get on with it,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri ruin. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating other people. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone up so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind ran awash with images of a cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his teeth. Ayram held the bone out away from him as if it were diseased and the thirst for flesh could rub off on him like a plague.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet waddled over and yanked the bone from the giant\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the open socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone onto the sand, right in front of Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look!\u8221\'94 shouted Purl. She was pointing towards the tower. Moto was sprinting out of the tower\u8217\'92s gate back towards them, running at full speed, frenetic, as if he were being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust in the wide mouth of the empty pass. When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, \u8220\'93There is something you need to see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Greskalun?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto shook his head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hrks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Forget about the Hrks. There\u8217\'92s something you need to see!\u8221\'94 He looked over his shoulder and grimaced.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pick up the Mazid,\u8221\'94 Ayram said to Mandri, and with that it was decided\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram would lead them all into the Goree Pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 At pace they came to the tower and its gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled, and bowing every so slightly out. Bricks bulged, some were twisted, some seem to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The gate underneath it was ten-men wide, and its arch was fanged by metal teeth which hung ominously above Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head. The tunnel itself was as large as the hall of the Hrkan prince, big enough to turn the sound of Ayram\u8217\'92s iron spear thumping against the hard dirt ground into an echo. Aside from this metronomic beat, they passed through this dark in silence, casting wary glances at each large door frames that pocketed either side of the gate\u8217\'92s long tunnel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and a shadow of shadows passed over his dark face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All around, stuck out of the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were wooden poles, each thick as a cow\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly and twice taller than Ayram. Wrapped around them were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a desecration.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Such was the defilement that curses leapt into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. The horror robbed him of his sense of the future, and it sent his stomach into a terrible, growling fit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The nearest wretch was some ten yards away\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant pilgrim. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, lolling in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of god.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 maybe there were fifty\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor Sparks littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo, with the use of his newly freed arm, hauled himself up onto Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder to see for himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri muttered, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I guess we know what happened to the Greskalun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo agreed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They must have gone insane,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I did not know one could hate a pilgrim this deeply.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl sank to her knees, half in prayer, half in buckling despair. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb, a man who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil presence of the scene for she had not made it through the tunnel. She was sitting inside its shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto said to him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you\u8217\'92d want to see for yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram cast an appraising eye back at his mournful band.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, but I didn\u8217\'92t think he had this in him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His remark startled Seb back into his skin. Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who cares if a few god-botherin\u8217\'92 Hrks got what was comin\u8217\'92 to \u8216\'91em? Besides, there\u8217\'92s nothin\u8217\'92 we can do for \u8216\'91em \u8216\'91cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And go where?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We go find the Greskalun!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There are no Greskalun!\u8221\'94 Moteah shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then who did all this?\u8221\'94 Seb asked as he gestured at the carnage. \u8220\'93Greskal ain\u8217\'92t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain\u8217\'92t one of \u8216\'91em.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moteah\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 she said, and her gravelly voice stunned them all back into silence. \u8220\'93Greskal would never do a thing like this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the darkness of the tunnel after her. Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up, leaning on her walking stick. If before her verve was waning, it was now well and truly gone. She walked towards the courtyard with a hobbling hitch that was not there before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They must have sensed the panic,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It seemed all her joints were aching as she lurched onwards. It was as if every long year of her life was suddenly set upon her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not just Greskal\u8217\'92s panic, no, that wouldn\u8217\'92t have been enough. The panic of the age\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s what gets their stomachs growling. Always does.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She stepped into the light of the courtyard and surveyed the carnage with a hateful glare.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can you sense it, Mazid? You have sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long that you can\u8217\'92t tell it\u8217\'92s there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can tell when someone has pissed themselves, if that\u8217\'92s what you\u8217\'92re asking?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93PANIC!\u8221\'94 Elrahet roared. \u8220\'93Panic sets their stomachs growling. Panic wakes them up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wakes who up?\u8221\'94 Seb asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lip curled to reveal a snaggletoothed grin.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The word zipped past Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ear like an arrow aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he\u8217\'92d just dodged another death. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This was demons that did this,\u8221\'94 Elrahet declared.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb raised voice and declared, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There ain\u8217\'92t nothin\u8217\'92 we can do for \u8216\'91em!\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Dead is dead,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim, and what he saw was death. Death was becoming a familiar sight to him, and he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen enough to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should do what we can for them.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet sighed and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Their very Sparks are bound to the poles. Death, for them, is impossible.\u8221\'94 She stamped her impatience into the ground with her cane and repeated, \u8220\'93We must leave at once.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 As soon as the words had left his mouth, there came from the distant west a sharp and roaring bleat\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Hrkan horn of war.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooo}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and there in the far distance was a horse and rider, galloping around from the right, around the sprawling tumble of the Pass\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shattered stones.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The horse, white as bone, came stumbling to a stop and reared up almost to the point of no control. The rider, little more than a speck so far away, was a man as dark as Moto and clad in the familiar blue robe of a Hrkan scribe. He shouted a command to his beast to settle it down, and all the while his face was trained on the tunnel where Mandri and the Ayramun stood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb was already fleeing. He was halfway up into the pass proper when he stopped and waved for everyone to follow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Damnit, come on!\u8221\'94 he urged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No one moved save for Ayram, who unshouldered his great pack and tossed it to the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Though the scribe was far away, all could see that in his hand was a sword, for he held it high, and the silver blade and golden guard caught the glare of the pre-noon sun. He barked some indiscernible word, and then, with a sweeping flourish, threw his sword onto the sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto saw the scribe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sign and gaped in disbelief. \u8220\'93He wants to bargain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Hrkan horn sounded out again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 BWEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooooooo}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From around the Pass\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s northern shelf came a column of white robed soldiers. At their head was a small child robed in black\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Mazidariga. They spread out into a line just behind the scribe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl asked everyone, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do we do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo perked up and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That Riga out there could have whistled out my will-less Spark by now, but it hasn\u8217\'92t. Those soldiers could be charging towards this tower, but they aren\u8217\'92t. There\u8217\'92s not much to read into this\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 these people actually mean to bargain.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The same reason anyone bargains\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they think they have something to lose.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe they think the Greskalun are here and on our side.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your guess is as good as mine,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Stay here, and stay hidden,\u8221\'94 said Ayram. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m going to see what they want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He began to march through the tunnel and out of the gate, spear gripped tightly in hand. The Hrkan scribe, upon seeing Ayram marching out into the Sand, set his horse to trotting towards the tower.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram paused a few yards outside the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gate, forcing the scribe to cross the greater distance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When the horse and rider finally neared the giant, Ayram laid down his spear. And though the scribe was high in his a saddle, they met almost eye to eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you Greskal?\u8221\'94 The rider asked, impressed at Ayram\u8217\'92s size.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The answer took the scribe by surprise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you the master of this tower?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram glanced behind him and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This tower has no master. As you can see, it is empty, save for me and mine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s horse was becoming fidgety. No doubt it had caught wind of the terror that lay in the courtyard. The scribe mistook it for fright at Ayram\u8217\'92s height.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The stern man said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We know that the Mazidobo resides in this tower.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So it does,\u8221\'94 said Ayram. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then bring it forth. I wish to speak with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can speak with me,\u8221\'94 said Ayram gruffly. \u8220\'93I will pass your message along.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe frowned. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is not the time for games,\u8221\'94 he warned. \u8220\'93We found the body of the Mazidariga of Shuls out in the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me, has the Mazidobo lost its flame? We saw no scorch marks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are welcome to test that interpretation, should you wish.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe sneered and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We know the Mazidobo has acquired some means of reversing the Mazidariga\u8217\'92s charm. We know that it escaped the leash of his Minder. We wish to come to terms with it, so as to avoid any further loss of life.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s horse was growing more perturbed by the moment. Its eyes were wide and its nostrils flared and it kept trying to resettle its rider, as if preparing to bolt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell the Mazidobo, that as we speak, a battalion of Hrkan Skulsi marches into the eastern mouth of the Goree Pass. At their head is the Mazidurn. Behind me, as you can see, is a column of swords, and coming up from the south, from the Solgi, is the Mazidban, who shall be with us shortly. As such, you are all surrounded, and should it come to it, you }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 will}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  be overwhelmed. There is no way out excepting the event in which you and yours peaceably disarm yourselves, and the Mazidobo offers itself up into my charge. In exchange, all lives will all be spared, and the Mazidobo shall be allowed to retire from service after submitting to examination. We do not need violence here, nor do we want it. More than anything, we want the Mazidobo alive, for we wish to learn from its malfunction.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t much like those terms,\u8221\'94 Ayram said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe frowned and his horse bucked slightly, sharing its rider\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s frustration.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is not a matter for you to decide,\u8221\'94 the scribe said. \u8220\'93Bring my terms to the Mazidobo, or bring the Mazidobo and I\u8217\'92ll tell it myself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram stroked his beard. He looked up at the sky, arced his shoulders, and he drew in a breath that could fill an ox\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach, enough air to think for a good long while. In the intervening silence, the scribe\u8217\'92s horse began to clip-clop its agitation, bouncing the scribe uncomfortably in his saddle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Settled down you crooked beast!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He gave his horse a foul kick in the ribs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram finally said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazid and its Minder will only treat with their own kind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazidobo\u8217\'92s Minder is dead. His body was found two weeks ago in the Junei hills.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazid has a new Minder. An old witch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brow jumped in surprise, and that quickly turned into elation. He mused, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s good. An unleashed Mazid would be no good for any of us. But if it will only speak to a Mazid, then we will have to wait, for the Mazidban will not be here for at least another hand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazidobo will treat with the Mazidariga.\u8221\'94 He nodded towards the Hrkan line behind the scribe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe bit his lip in frustration. He looked up, took in the tower, then spied the long distance behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93But I won\u8217\'92t do this business in the shadow of this accursed place. We\u8217\'92ll meet where the tower\u8217\'92s shadow meets the light of Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 With the sun approaching its noontime zenith, the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow extended out into the desert a mere forty yards or so.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fair enough,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Before the scribe and his horse ran off, he said,  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no sense in playing me, poke. There\u8217\'92s nowhere to run if you resort to trickery.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram picked up his spear. The scribe sneered, then barked at his horse and yanked on the reins as he jabbed its flanks with his heels. Off they went galloping, back towards the Hrkan line.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram spun around, and nested inside his beard was the biggest of all possible smiles, considering the size of his head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen shines on us!\u8221\'94 he declared as he stepped back into the tower\u8217\'92s tunnel. Moto was the first to greet him by saying, \u8220\'93This will be easier than I ever dreamed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram nodded and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That scribe won\u8217\'92t know what hit him. Can you believe it!? Hrks think they\u8217\'92re gods when they\u8217\'92re stuck up on a horse. Who says the Goree is cursed?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He marched over to his giant pack, untied the bindings that kept it shut, then lifted it up and dumped its contents on the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Split this up between you,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93And make sure that everyone is ready to run.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Run where?\u8221\'94 Seb asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Once I strike that scribe down, we need to run. I\u8217\'92m not going to stop to help any of you get yourselves together, so if you\u8217\'92re not ready, if you fall behind, you\u8217\'92re forgotten.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram then stepped over to Mandri. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Turn around,\u8221\'94 and Mandri turned, and then Ayram pulled Obo out of the litter by his skull again, as if handling a melon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo dangled in Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grip, looking like a pale worm. He said to Ayram, \u8220\'93You know, I could ruin this for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mood soured at the suggestion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to ruin it,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93I just wanted you all to know that I could have.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram grunted and tossed Obo onto his emptied pack. Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pale, bald head and bony arm were almost glowing in the tunnel dark, but most of all, his saucer eyes were bright and shining. They scanned the world for something, probably they were looking for something he could use to rescue himself. Mandri knew no rescue was coming and that, for Obo, this might be the end. Then those eyes settled on Mandri, and Mandri felt his stomach knot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was nothing he could do for Obo\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and yet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85and yet\u8230\'85odd that he should feel this way for so strange a face. Some mothers love children with faces much worse off than Obo\u8217\'92s, not that Mandri was feeling something so pure. It was just the sense of }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 pity}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Obo was going to be snuffed out for no other reason than he was what he was, and what a shame. Born almost yesterday, enslaved and tortured all his short life, quartered by desert bandits, and he was still holding out hope, still looking at Mandri like Mandri was important. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had to look away. But he could not quell the budding sense that something was being uncovered here, and that was horrible, because as any self-watcher knows, finding things out about oneself is the worst kind of finding. And Obo was }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 right there}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 , and this was a permanent goodbye, Mandri knew it. Then that pang of pity came back fierce and welled up in his throat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He could not speak for fear of sobbing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He swallowed it down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He glanced at Obo and the sob of pity rose again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then a small miracle occurred.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb, in an attempt to reorganize his pack\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s interior to make room for a bundle of dried beef, pulled out a woolen blanket, and in so doing, unwittingly pulled out his pouch of burgeons as well. The pouch hit the ground and out popped three beautiful God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeons. Two of them spiraled harmlessly in little circles, but one burgeon hit the ground rolling as if flicked towards Mandri\u8217\'92s toes by Solraheen Himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri covered it up with his foot. When Seb finally noticed that his burgeons had spilled, he snatched them up, quick as a fox, none the wiser that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d missed one.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The feeling of that burgeon under Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s heel was brighter than any morning. Mandri didn\u8217\'92t even hear Obo\u8217\'92s final parting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Never let it be said that I didn\u8217\'92t do anything for you people.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto yanked the L-frame litter right off Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back, because Moto had made a makeshift bag out of a blanket, and he\u8217\'92d filled that bag with the stuff that had tumbled out of Ayram\u8217\'92s pack\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 liquid skins, knotted ropes and strings, and odd-shaped dried mutton lumps wrapped in linen cloth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Where had any of that meat been during the long journey through the Tib?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No matter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye under his foot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But even this thought was not enough to last, for when Moto handed the litter back to Mandri, it was twice the weight that Obo ever was.}}
