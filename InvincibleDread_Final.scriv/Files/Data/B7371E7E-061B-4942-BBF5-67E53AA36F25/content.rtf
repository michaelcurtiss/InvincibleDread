\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 The Problem of the Criterion is considered by many to be a fundamental problem of epistemology.\~ In fact, Chisholm (1973, 1) claims that the Problem of the Criterion is \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93one of the most important and one of the most difficult of all the problems of philosophy.\u8221\'94 A popular form of the Problem of the Criterion can be raised by asking two seemingly innocent questions: What do we know? How are we to decide in any particular case whether we have knowledge?\~ One quickly realizes how troubling the Problem of the Criterion is because it seems that before we can answer the first question we must already have an answer to the second question, but it also seems that before we can answer the second question we must already have an answer to the first question.\~ That is, it seems that before we can determine what we know we must first have a method or criterion for distinguishing cases of knowledge from cases that are not knowledge. \~Yet, it seems that before we can determine the appropriate criterion of knowledge we must first know which particular instances are in fact knowledge.\~ So, we seem to be stuck going around a circle without any way of getting our epistemological theorizing started.\~ Although there are various ways of responding to the Problem of the Criterion, the problem is difficult precisely because it seems that each response comes at a cost.\~ This article examines the nature of the Problem and the costs associated with the most promising responses to the Problem.}{ }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 The Problem of the Criterion is the ancient problem of the \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93wheel\u8221\'94 or the \u8220\'93diallelus\u8221\'94.\~ It comes to us from Book 2 of Sextus Empiricus\u8217\'92\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 Outlines of Pyrrhonism}{\f0\fs24\b0 .\~ Sextus presents the Problem of the Criterion as a major issue in the debate between the Academic Skeptics and the Stoics.\~ After Sextus\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92 presentation though, philosophers largely seemed to lose interest in the Problem of the Criterion until the modern period.\~ The problem resurfaced in the late 1500\u8217\'92s with Michael De Montaigne\u8217\'92s \u8220\'93Apology for Raymond Sebond\u8221\'94 and it again had a significant influence.\~ Following the modern period, however, the Problem of the Criterion largely disappeared until the early 19}{\f0\fs24\b0\super th}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~century when G.W.F. Hegel (1807) presented the problem and, arguably, put forward one of the first coherentist responses to the Problem of the Criterion (Rockmore (2006) and Aikin (2010)). In the late 19}{\f0\fs24\b0\super th}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~and early 20}{\f0\fs24\b0\super th}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~centuries Cardinal D.J. Mercier (1884) and his student P.

\par\plain 
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 \~Chisholm (1973, 12) often introduces the Problem of the Criterion with the following pairs of questions:}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 (A)\~ What do we know? What is the extent of our knowledge?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 (B) How are we to decide whether we know? What are the criteria of knowledge?}

\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Robert Amico (1993) argues that Chisholm mistakenly takes himself to be discussing the same problem as Sextus Empiricus when he considers the Problem of the Criterion.\~ Richard Fumerton (2008) points out that there are at least two versions of the Problem of the Criterion.\~ The first is a methodological problem of trying to identify sources of knowledge or justified belief (this, he claims, is the version of the problem that Chisholm focuses on).\~ The second is the problem of trying to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for correctly applying concepts such as \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91knowledge\u8217\'92 or \u8216\'91justification\u8217\'92.\~}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 , perhaps the best way to formulate the Problem of the Criterion in its most general form is with the following pair of questions (Cling (1994) and McCain and Rowley (2014)):}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 (1) Which propositions are true?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 (2) How can we tell which propositions are true?}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Before moving on it is important to be clear about the nature of (1) and (2).\~ These are not questions about the nature of truth itself.\~ Rather, these are\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 epistemological\~}{\f0\fs24\b0 questions concerning which propositions we should think are true and what the correct criteria are for determining whether a proposition should be accepted as true or false.\~ It is possible that one could have answers to these questions without possessing any particular theory of truth, or even taking a stand at all as to the correct theory of truth. \~Additionally, it is possible to have a well-developed theory of the nature of truth without having an answer to either (1) or (2).\~ So, the issue at the heart of the Problem of the Criterion is how to start our epistemological theorizing in the correct way, not how to discover a theory of the nature of truth.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Of course, there are anti-skeptical ways to respond to the Problem of the Criterion.\~ According to Chisholm, these anti-skeptical responses are question-begging.\~ In light of this one might think that extreme skepticism is inevitable.\~ However, this might not be correct.\~ The extreme skepticism threatened by the Problem of the Criterion itself seems guilty of begging the question.\~ This is why Chisholm (1973, 37) claims \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93we can deal with the problem only by begging the question.\u8221\'94}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 According to Chisholm, there are only three responses to the Problem of the Criterion: particularism, methodism, and skepticism.\~ The particularist assumes an answer to (1) and then uses that to answer (2), whereas the methodist assumes an answer to (2) and then uses that to answer (1).\~ The skeptic claims that you cannot answer (1) without first having an answer to (2) and you cannot answer (2) without first having an answer to (1), and so you cannot answer either. Chisholm claims that, unfortunately, regardless of which of these responses to the Problem of the Criterion we adopt we are forced to beg the question.\~ It will be worth examining each of the responses to the Problem of the Criterion that Chisholm considers and how each begs the question against the others.}{ }

\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://iep.utm.edu/problem-of-the-criterion"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24 https://iep.utm.edu/problem-of-the-criterion}}{/}
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 The particularist assumes an answer to (1) that does not epistemically depend on an answer to (2) and uses her answer to (1) to answer (2). More precisely, the particularist response to the Problem of the Criterion is:}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i1 Particularism}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ Assume an answer to (1) (accept some set of propositions as true) that does not depend on an answer to (2) and use the answer to (1) to answer (2).}
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 However, things are worse than this. The real problem with particularism is not simply the dialectical problem of providing grounds that methodists and skeptics will accept; rather it is an epistemic problem. The problem with particularism is that the particularist\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s starting point is an unfounded assumption.\~ Particularism starts with a set of particular propositions and works from there. \~If the particularist goes beyond that set of particular propositions to provide reasons for accepting them, she abandons\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 that}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~particularist response and either picks a new set of particular propositions to assume (a\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 new}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~particularist response) or picks something other than simply a new set of only particular propositions to assume and ceases to be a particularist.\~ So, the problem for the particularist response is much deeper than a dialectical problem that arises only when trying to deal with opposing views.\~ The particularist cannot offer reasons for particularism beyond the unfounded assumption of a set of particular propositions. By simply assuming an answer to (1), the particularist begs the question against both the methodists and the skeptics.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i1 Methodism}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ Assume an answer to (2) (accept some criterion to be a correct criterion of truth \endash  one that}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 \~}{\f0\fs24\b0 successfully discriminates true propositions from false ones) that does not depend on an answer to (1) and use the answer to (2) to answer (1).}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Since methodism begins by assuming that some criterion is a correct criterion of truth without providing any epistemic reason to prefer this response to the alternatives, it begs the question against particularism and skepticism.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 The skeptical response to the Problem of the Criterion assumes that both particularism and methodism are mistaken.\~ \~That is, the skeptical response to the Problem of the Criterion assumes that there is no answer to (1) that does not depend on an answer to (2) and there is no answer to (2) that does not depend on an answer to (1). As Chisholm (1973, 14) explains the response:}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 And so we can formulate the position of}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 \~}{\f0\fs24\b0 the skeptic on these matters. He will say: \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91You cannot answer question 1 until you answer question 2. And you cannot answer question 2 until you answer question 1. Therefore, you cannot answer either question. You cannot know what, if anything, you know, and there is no possible way for you to decide in any particular case.\u8217\'92}
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 \~The skeptic simply assumes that there is no independent answer to (1) or (2) and though both the particularist and the methodist deny this assumption, they can only respond by appealing to assumptions of their own.\~ The skeptic has no reasons to support the assumption that there is no independent answer to (1) or (2).\~ The conflict between the three responses that Chisholm considers comes down to ungrounded assumptions. It is because of this fact that Chisholm claims when facing the Problem of the Criterion we have no choice but to beg the question. Since all responses beg the question, skepticism is no better off than any other response to the Problem of the Criterion.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 \~One of the lessons of Cartesian skepticism is that it is implausible to think that we can be absolutely certain about the truth of any proposition about the external world.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Each of these responses to the Problem of the Criterion begins with an unfounded\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 assumption}{\f0\fs24\b0 , one that is unsupported by reasons, and so begs the question in an epistemic sense against the other two.\~ Despite this and his emphasis on the fact that all three responses are unappealing because of their question-begging, Chisholm famously argues in support of particularism.\~ His argument in support of particularism, which he sometimes refers to as \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93commonsensism\u8221\'94, involves criticizing the other two responses and giving some reasons for preferring particularism.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 \~ If methodism is flawed because it will lead to skepticism concerning many areas where we take ourselves to have knowledge, it is no surprise that Chisholm finds the skeptical response to the Problem of the Criterion to be unacceptable.\~ It too has this result.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Why isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t this just kant\u8217\'92s a priori truths?}
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Unfortunately, Chisholm\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s positive support for particularism is very sparse.\~ In fact in his Aquinas Lectures he only claims, \u8220\'93in favor of our approach [particularism] there is the fact that we\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 do}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~know many things, after all\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 (1973, 38).\~ But, of course, this seems to merely be a statement of the assumption made by particularism, not a defense of it. As a solution to the Problem of the Criterion, Chisholm\u8217\'92s particularism seems to be lacking.\~ In fact, Robert Amico (1988b) argues that Chisholm\u8217\'92s \u8220\'93solution\u8221\'94 is clearly unacceptable because Chisholm does not give us good independent reasons to reject either methodism or skepticism, he does not provide good reasons to prefer particularism to the other responses, and, as Chisholm himself admits, particularism begs the question.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 In fact, Andrew Cling (1994) argues that there are eight non-skeptical responses to the Problem of the Criterion.\~ Importantly, Cling does not consider two of the non-skeptical responses that we will consider below, so it seems that if Cling is correct concerning the eight non-skeptical approaches he mentions and the two additional approaches discussed below are distinct responses, there are at least eleven (ten non-skeptical and one skeptical) responses to the Problem of the Criterion.\~ While there are many possible responses to the Problem of the Criterion the focus here will be limited to those that have been defended in the literature.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 The employment of explanatory reasoning offers promising alternatives to the responses Chisholm considers.\~ These explanationist responses share a commitment to explanatory reasoning\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they all involve attempting to answer (1) and (2) in a way that yields the most satisfactory explanatory picture.\~ A helpful way of understanding explanationist responses is as employing the method of reflective equilibrium to respond to the Problem of the Criterion. Roughly, the method of reflective equilibrium involves starting with a set of data (beliefs, intuitions, etc.) and making revisions to that set\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 giving up some of the data, adding new data to the set, giving more/less weight to some of the data, and so on\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 so as to create the best explanatory picture overall. \~Reaching this equilibrium state of maximized explanatory coherence of the remaining data is thought to make accepting whatever data remains, whether this includes any of one\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s initial data or not, reasonable (see\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://iep.utm.edu/coherent/"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 coherentism}}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~and\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://iep.utm.edu/rawls/"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 John Rawls}}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~for more on reflective equilibrium).\~ Of course, there have been criticisms of the viability of reflective equilibrium as a method of reasoning; however, for current purposes these can be set aside because the ultimate concern here is simply the sort of responses that can be generated by employing reflective equilibrium.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Although the explanatory particularism defended by Paul Moser (1989) is a kind of particularism, its explanationist elements warrant discussing it as a separate variety of response.\~ Moser\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s (1989, 261) explanatory particularism begins with one\u8217\'92s \u8220\'93}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 considered, but revisable, judgments}{\f0\fs24\b0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 concerning particular propositions.\~ This is importantly different from the sort of particularism that Chisholm describes because explanatory particularism allows that the beliefs about the truth of particular propositions are revisable whereas particularism as Chisholm describes it does not clearly allow for this.\~ It is because of this that Moser claims that explanatory particularism does not beg the question against skeptics by ruling out skepticism from the start.\~ Importantly, the kind of skepticism Moser is discussing here is not the skeptical response to the Problem of the Criterion, but rather the sort of skepticism that grants that we can get started in epistemological theorizing while claiming that ultimately we will end up lacking knowledge in a wide range of cases. External world skepticism is an example of this sort of skepticism; it grants that we are aware of what is required for knowledge, but claims that we simply fail to have knowledge of the world around us.\~ Like Chisholm\u8217\'92s particularism, explanatory particularism uses this initial set of propositions (i.e. this answer to (1)) to develop epistemic principles or criteria for truth (i.e. to answer (2)).\~ The initial set of propositions and criteria are both continually revised until a state of maximal explanatory coherence is reached.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Moser claims that explanatory particularism avoids begging the question in the way that Chisholm\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s particularism or methodism does.\~ The reason for this is that Moser claims that the beliefs that explanatory particularism starts with are revisable.\~ Despite this and Moser\u8217\'92s claim that explanatory particularism does not beg the question against the skeptic, it is not clear that it avoids begging the question against the skeptical response to the Problem of the Criterion.\~ After all, explanatory particularism assumes an independent answer to (1)\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 revisable or not it is still an answer\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and then uses that to answer (2).\~ So, it at least seems that explanatory particularism begs the question against the skeptical response by denying the skeptic\u8217\'92s assumption that there is no independent answer to (1) or (2).}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Ernest Sosa (2009) also defends a view that we might call explanatory particularism.\~ On Sosa\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s view we begin with particular items of knowledge.\~ That is, we start with particular propositions that we know to be true.\~ According to Sosa, we know these propositions because our beliefs with respect to these propositions satisfy a correct general criterion of knowledge (they are formed by sufficiently reliable cognitive faculties).\~ Although we have knowledge of these propositions, we merely have what he terms \u8220\'93animal knowledge\u8221\'94.\~ Our knowledge of these propositions when we begin is only animal knowledge because we lack a higher-order perspective on these beliefs.\~ That is to say, we lack \u8220\'93reflective knowledge\u8221\'94 of the fact that these first-order beliefs satisfy the proper criterion of knowledge.\~ However, on Sosa\u8217\'92s view we use our animal knowledge to develop a perspective on our epistemic situation that offers us an explanatory picture about how or why our first-order beliefs really do constitute knowledge, i.e. we develop reflective knowledge as to how our particular pieces of animal knowledge satisfy the proper criterion for knowledge.\~ This explanatory perspective yields reflective knowledge and it strengthens our animal knowledge.\~ A significant component of this picture is that we use our starting animal knowledge to come to answer both (1) and (2) from a reflective standpoint.\~ So, we begin with an answer to (1) in terms of animal knowledge and we use that answer to develop a perspective that gives us an answer to (2) with respect to both animal and reflective knowledge and an answer to (1) in terms of reflective knowledge.\~ Sosa\u8217\'92s explanatory response to the Problem of the Criterion relies on a mixture of levels.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Although Sosa\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s explanatory particularism with its multiple levels seems more complex that Moser\u8217\'92s, one might think that it begs the question in the same way that Moser\u8217\'92s response does.\~ Namely, Sosa\u8217\'92s response, like Moser\u8217\'92s, assumes an independent answer to (1). Sosa\u8217\'92s assumed answer is only in terms of animal knowledge, however, it is still an answer.\~ His response then requires using that answer to develop an explanatory perspective that provides an answer to (2).\~ Thus, one might think that Sosa\u8217\'92s response seems to beg the question against the skeptical response in the same way that Moser\u8217\'92s response seems to: by denying the skeptic\u8217\'92s assumption (i) that there is no independent answer to (1) or (2).}
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\line }{\f0\fs24\b0 Coherentism responds to the Problem of the Criterion by starting with both beliefs about which propositions are true and beliefs about the correct method or methods for telling which beliefs are true.\~ It then uses these beliefs to attempt to answer both (1) and (2) at the same time (DePaul 1988 & 2009, Cling 1994, and Poston 2011). As Andrew Cling (1994, 274) explains:}
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 To be a coherentist is to reject the epistemic priority of beliefs and criteria of truth. Instead, coherentists recommend balancing beliefs against criteria and criteria against beliefs until they all form a consistent, mutually supporting system.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 On one understanding of coherentism (Cling\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s 1994 and Poston\u8217\'92s 2011) the coherentist accepts one of the skeptic\u8217\'92s assumptions, but denies the other.\~ In particular, this version of coherentism shares the skeptic\u8217\'92s assumption of (i) (there is no independent answer to (1) or (2)), but denies (ii) (if (1) and (2) cannot be answered independently, they cannot be answered at all).\~ More precisely, on this way of understanding coherentism it involves accepting (i) of Skepticism and adding to it the further assumptions that: (a) a particular criterion is correct (namely, explanatory goodness), (b) a set of particular propositions are true, and (c) the criterion and the set of propositions are not independent of each other.\~ However, it seems that if one begins with beliefs about which propositions are true and beliefs about the correct criteria for telling which beliefs are true along with the assumption that there is no independent answer to (1) or (2), this version of coherentism will beg the question for reasons similar to why Skepticism begs the question.\~ That is to say, the coherentist\u8217\'92s assumption of (i) begs the question against particularism and methodism.\~ After all, (i) is a groundless assumption with which the coherentist starts.\~ It may be awareness of this feature that helped lead Cling (2009) to ultimately abandon his coherentist response in favor of a skeptical stance with respect to the Problem of the Criterion.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Another way of understanding this approach is as Michael DePaul (1988 & 2009) depicts it.\~ According to this way of understanding coherentism, the coherentist starts with beliefs about which particular propositions are true and about the correct criteria for telling which beliefs are true, but she does not assume (i). This version of coherentism seems to avoid begging the question against both particularists and methodists because it does not assume that we can answer (1) prior to (2) or that we can answer (2) prior to (1) nor does it assume that they cannot be answered independently.\~ Instead, this kind of coherentism merely applies reflective equilibrium to the coherentist\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s starting set of beliefs without taking a stand on (i) at all.\~}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 However, its use of beliefs in the relevant data set seems to beg the question against the skeptic because starting with beliefs about which propositions are true assumes that we can answer and in fact already have an answer to (1).\~ Likewise, a belief about which criteria are successful for telling which beliefs are true assumes that we can answer and have an answer to (2).\~\~ In other words, this version of coherentism seems to beg the question against skepticism by assuming that (ii) is false.\~ Thus, applying reflective equilibrium to a set of beliefs appears to beg the question by assuming that one of the assumptions of skepticism is false from the outset.\~ This may be why DePaul (2009) accepts Chisholm\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s position that all responses to the Problem of the Criterion end up begging the question.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 A final coherentist response is Nicholas Rescher\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s \u8220\'93systems-theoretic approach\u8221\'94.\~ Rescher\u8217\'92s development of this approach takes place over several books (1973a, 1973b, 1977, and 1980).\~ Although Rescher\u8217\'92s systems-theoretic approach is complex, the relevant details for the present discussion of the Problem of the Criterion are relatively straightforward. Rescher\u8217\'92s response begins by appealing to pragmatic considerations.\~ It starts with a method and a goal, applies the method and checks to see whether the results satisfy the goal.\~ So, with respect to the Problem of the Criterion the idea is that our goal is to come to believe true propositions and we start with some criterion for distinguishing true propositions from false.\~ We apply our criterion and then see if it helps us achieve our goal.\~ Assuming that the criterion does help us achieve our goal, we have completed the first step in Rescher\u8217\'92s process.\~ The second step in this process involves showing that a pragmatically successful criterion/method is connected to the truth.\~ Here Rescher (1977, 107) claims that \u8220\'93only when all the pieces fit together\u8221\'94 do we have justification for the criterion.\~ Further, he is clear that coherence is central to this process.\~ It is because of this that Robert Amico (1993) argues that Rescher\u8217\'92s view, though complex, is simply a coherentist version of methodism\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Rescher ultimately assumes that coherence is the appropriate criterion of truth.\~}{ }

\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 A final explanationist response to the Problem of the Criterion is what Earl Conee (2004) calls \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Applied Evidentialism\u8221\'94 (McCain and Rowley (2014) call it the \u8220\'93Seeming Intuition Response\u8221\'94).\~ This explanationist response differs from the previous ways of using reflective equilibrium to respond to the Problem of the Criterion in that it does not start with a set of beliefs.\~ Rather, Applied Evidentialism begins with one\u8217\'92s evidence.\~ In particular, when Conee defends this view he suggests beginning with the set of intuitions or what seems true to us about various propositions.\~ That is to say, Applied Evidentialism begins with what seems true to us both with respect to propositions about particular items of fact and with respect to criteria for determining when propositions are true.\~ According to Applied Evidentialism, the way to respond to the Problem of the Criterion is to start with these intuitions and then make modifications\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 give up some intuitions, form different intuitions, rank some intuitions as more/less important than others, and so on\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0  until a state of equilibrium has been reached.\~ Once such an equilibrium state has been reached the data from that state can be used to answer (1) and (2).\~}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Like the other ways of using reflective equilibrium to respond to the Problem of the Criterion, Applied Evidentialism does not seem to beg the question against particularism or methodism because it does not assume that there can be no independent answer to (1) or (2).\~ Additionally, Applied Evidentialism does not seem to beg the question against the skeptic because it refrains from assuming an answer to (1) or (2) at the outset.\~ Further, Applied Evidentialism does not assume from the start that the equilibrium state that we end up with will be anti-skeptical.\~ It is consistent with Applied Evidentialism that reflection on our initial intuitions will in the end lead us to the conclusion that we are unaware of which propositions are true or that we lack an appropriate criterion for discovering this information.\~ In other words, Applied Evidentialism does not assume that we will have an answer to (1) or (2) when we reach our end equilibrium state.\~ After all, it could be that our equilibrium state is one in which no method appears to be correct and our best position with respect to each proposition seems to be to suspend judgment concerning its truth.\~ So, Applied Evidentialism does not seem to beg any questions against the skeptical response to the Problem of the Criterion or other kinds of skepticism, such as Cartesian skepticism.}
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\line }{\f0\fs24\b0 McCain and Rowley further argue that Applied Evidentialism does not beg the question by assuming that reflective equilibrium is the correct criterion or method at the outset.\~ They maintain that this is not to say that one cannot be aware that reflective equilibrium is a good method from the outset.\~ Rather, they claim that the important point is that Applied Evidentialism does not take the goodness of reflective equilibrium as a starting assumption\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 perhaps one has the intuition that reflective equilibrium is a good method to employ, perhaps not. \~The key, they argue, is that unlike methodism Applied Evidentialism does not\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 require\~}{\f0\fs24\b0 one to have beliefs about, or even awareness of, reflective equilibrium to begin to respond to the Problem of the Criterion.\~ So, they argue Applied Evidentialism is not a form of methodism.\~ And thus, Applied Evidentialism does not beg the questions that methodism does.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Even if one accepts that Applied Evidentialism does not beg the question, it may have other problems.\~ It seems that in order to avoid begging the question Applied Evidentialism requires being able to employ reflective equilibrium in responding to the Problem of the Criterion without needing reasons to think that reflective equilibrium is a good method from the start.\~ This, however, seems to commit the supporter of Applied Evidentialism to accepting that certain kinds of circular reasoning can provide one with good reasons.\~ More precisely, if Applied Evidentialism is to avoid being a form of methodism, and the question begging that comes with methodism, then it seems that Applied Evidentialism requires that one can have good reasons to believe the results of employing reflective equilibrium without first having good reasons to accept reflective equilibrium as a good method.\~ But, this allows for epistemic circularity because it can be the case that the claim that reflective equilibrium is a good method is itself one of the results that is produced in the final equilibrium state.\~ The heart of this worry is that Applied Evidentialism allows someone to use reflective equilibrium to come to reasonably believe that reflective equilibrium is a good method for determining true propositions.\~}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Robert Amico (1988a, 1993, and 1996) offers a very different response to the Problem of the Criterion.\~ Rather than attempting to solve the Problem of the Criterion, Amico attempts to \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93dissolve\u8221\'94 it.\~ According to Amico, a philosophical problem is a question that can only be answered theoretically\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it cannot be answered by purely empirical investigation.\~ Further, a philosophical problem is such that there is rational doubt as to the correct answer to the question asked by the problem.\~ He explains rational doubt as simply being such that withholding belief in a particular answer is the justified doxastic attitude to take.\~ Since he explicates philosophical problems in terms of rational doubt and rational doubt is relative to a person, Amico maintains that problems are always relative to particular people.\~ A particular question poses a problem for someone when that question generates rational doubt for her.\~}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 It is because of the role of rational doubt that Amico distinguishes between solutions to problems and dissolutions of problems.\~ A solution to a problem is a set of true statements that answer the question that generates the problem and removes the rational doubt concerning the answer to the question.\~ Dissolution occurs when the rational doubt is removed, not by an answer to the question, but rather by recognition that it is impossible to adequately answer the question.\~ For example, Amico claims that the problem of how to square a circle is dissolved as soon as one recognizes that it is impossible to make a circular square.\~ Once someone sees that it is impossible to make a circular square, the question \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do you square a circle?\u8221\'94 does not generate any rational doubt for her.\~ Without rational doubt, Amico claims that the problem has been dissolved and there is no need to look for a solution.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Like all problems, Amico claims that the Problem of the Criterion is only a problem for a particular person when its question raises rational doubt for the person.\~ When we first consider the questions posed by the Problem of the Criterion Amico claims that we may have rational doubt about how to answer the questions in such a way that that answer can be justified to the skeptic.\~ So, we face a problem.\~ However, Amico argues that consideration of the failure of other responses\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in particular their tendency to be question begging\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0  and consideration of the nature of the problem itself allows one to recognize that it is in fact impossible to answer the questions of the Problem of the Criterion in a way that can be justified to the skeptic.\~ Once one recognizes that it is impossible to answer the skeptic\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s questions Amico alleges that the rational doubt generated by the Problem of the Criterion is removed.\~ Thus, he claims that the Problem of the Criterion is at that point dissolved.\~ Since it has been dissolved, we should not be troubled by the Problem of the Criterion at all.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 There are three major challenges to Amico\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s purported dissolution of the Problem of the Criterion.\~ The first, as Sharon Ryan (1996) argues, is that it does not seem that the problem has been dissolved, but instead it seems that Amico has simply accepted that the skeptic is correct.\~ Amico responds by claiming that the skeptical position is not a solution to the problem because that position cannot be justified to the particularist or the methodist.\~ Since none of the three positions can justify their position to the others, he claims that the problem is dissolved.\~ It is not clear that this adequately responds to Ryan\u8217\'92s criticism because one might think that claiming that there is no acceptable answer to the questions of the Problem of the Criterion is exactly what the skeptic had in mind all along.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 The third major challenge to Amico\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s view arises because he seems to rest his dissolution on what can and cannot be said in response to a skeptic.\~ Andrew Cling argues that the Problem of the Criterion does not require skeptical interlocutors at all.\~ Rather, Cling maintains that the difficulty illuminated by the Problem of the Criterion is that anti-skeptics have commitments that seem plausible when considered individually, but they are jointly inconsistent.\~ The inconsistency among these commitments is present whether or not there are skeptics.\~}{\f0\fs24\b1  Thus, Cling contends that arguing that the Problem of the Criterion is constituted by questions that cannot be answered does not dissolve the problem; it brings the problem to light.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 First, James Van Cleve (1979) and Ernest Sosa (2007) maintain that the Cartesian Circle is in fact just a special instance of the Problem of the Criterion (See\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://iep.utm.edu/descarte/"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Descartes}}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~for more on the Cartesian Circle).\~}

\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Next, Ruth Weintraub (1995) argues that Hume\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s attack on induction is simply a special case of the Problem of the Criterion.\~ She claims that Hume essentially applies the Problem of the Criterion to induction rather than applying the problem in a general fashion (For more on Humean inductive skepticism see\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://iep.utm.edu/conf-ind/"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 confirmation and induction}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ,\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://iep.utm.edu/epistemo/"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 epistemology}}{\f0\fs24\b0 , and\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://iep.utm.edu/hume-cau/"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Hume: causation}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ).}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 According to Bryson Brown (2006), the challenge of responding to skepticism about the past is just a version of the Problem of the Criterion.\~ He claims that debunking Bertrand Russell\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s five-minute old universe hypothesis, for example, involves providing a criterion for trusting memory.\~ This, he argues, requires satisfactorily responding to the Problem of the Criterion.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Andrew Cling (2009) and (2014) maintains that the Problem of the Criterion and the regress argument for skepticism are closely related.\~ In fact, he argues that they are both instances of a more general problem that he calls the \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93paradox of reasons\u8221\'94.\~ Cling argues that this paradox arises because it seems that it is possible to have reasons for a belief, it seems that reasons themselves must be supported by reasons, and it seems that if an endless sequence of reasons\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 either in the form of an infinite regress or a circle of reasons\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 is necessary for having reasons for a belief, then it is impossible to have reasons for a belief. \~According to Cling, these three commitments are inconsistent.\~ The important point for the current purpose is that Cling maintains that the Problem of the Criterion and the regress argument for skepticism are both instances of the paradox of reasons (See\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://iep.utm.edu/inf-epis/"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 infinitism in epistemology}}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~for more on regress arguments).}{ }
