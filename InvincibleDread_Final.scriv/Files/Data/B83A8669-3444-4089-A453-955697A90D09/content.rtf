He was still recovering from the rigor of death. He stretched out his legs and waited as the sun crossed over to noon, such that its light shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. Most of the Ayramun retreated into the tunnel. Forty stayed to keep watch over Mandri, and Mandri stayed because he wasn\u8217\'92t sure he was allowed to move. He preferred the warmth anyways, and he had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd of brown ragged men and women came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, away from Mandri, chattering excitedly like children. Then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention. Out of the shadows came Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had never seen a man so big.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen giants in paintings, but those were paintings. Usually they were paintings of Hrkan Lords made twice the size of everyone else, an unreality meant to lift up ordinary rulers in the eyes of their subjects. It was a tired genre, the conquering hero, a joke even amongst the Lords themselves. They knew they were ordinary men. But Ayram was no ordinary man. The first thought that came to Mandri\u8217\'92s mind when he saw the man was, \u8216\'91White light, he\u8217\'92s big,\u8217\'92 and the second was, \u8216\'91Arnaggu\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Arnaggu was the first Hrkan Lord, a true conquering hero, the inspiration for the genre. In some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towered above the sandswept Forni plain. It was a terrifying piece. The relief itself sat four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicted stretched all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image was a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen, limbs splayed out like flattened lizards, all dressed in the garb of slaves\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 naked torsos and skirted hips. Their faces are fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is depicted ten times larger than any other. He stood at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage, and his upper torso and head were the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seemed to be tearing himself out of the rock,, eyes wild but brow level and stern, as if he\u8217\'92d just heard whispers of rebellion and could not possibly believe such fools would dare.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen, and despite the over-reliance on scale, that prickling sense of awe that stippled his skin. Make something big enough, and a person standing next to it is bound to feel small, and Arnaggu\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s architects had carved his image into a mountain, and so the viewer is forced to contend with not only the relief but the entirety of the rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram looked like Arnaggu reborn, a true giant, with a stern countenance seemingly carved from stone. His head was wrapped up in a black headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a round, black, bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style of beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet Unkileen, who was himself named after an ancient mountain god. Ayram wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens. And the way he moved, with his too-long legs wrapped in faded black wool and swinging in a loping gait, he seemed possessed of that skinny-legged power hidden inside a horse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, the man carried under his arm the body of a conquered wretch, none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo, whose bald head was twisted the right way around, eyes blinking in the sun. Set against Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bronzed skin and black robes, Obo\u8217\'92s naked, chalk-white skin was positively gleaming.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him, all staring at the Mazid like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for their master to divvy up the meal. The awkward nakedness of Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s  body drew hearty jeers. Weeg was quick to point out that this Mazid didn\u8217\'92t have an asshole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No wonder he acts like his shit don\u8217\'92t stink,\u8221\'94 he said, smirking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It do when it come out the mouth,\u8221\'94 said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bet it does!\u8221\'94 Tob roared. He slapped his knee and then killed the joke by hitting it square in the face\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8220\'93Shit comes out its mouth because its full of shit!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His belly-rumbling laugh was followed a storm of obscenities that rained down upon poor Obo\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 almost all the Ayramun joined in. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo bore their insults with the indifferent bearing of a bullied child who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo smiled as if to gloat, and this triggered a roar of fury from Weeg and renewed calls for the Mazid\u8217\'92s head on a spike.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram settled them all down with a shrill, sharp, two-fingered whistle. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet!\u8221\'94 he shouted. His voice was deep and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous chest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 An old woman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice came grumbling out of the cave, \u8220\'93Sol\u8217\'92s light, I\u8217\'92m coming.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The sight of her hobbling out of the dark with a thigh-high cane conformed exactly to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s expectations. She was a witch\u8217\'92s witch, clouded in a mass of ruffled black tatters, though she kept her shawled head downcast in deference. With her spine as bowed as it was, she was no taller than Ayram\u8217\'92s hip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 With the pit\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s circle filled, Ayram fixed his gaze upon his followers, and eventually his eyes settled on Mandri. \u8220\'93And you,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93Come here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Forty pushed Mandri up and motioned him on. Mandri scuffled across the sand towards Ayram, suddenly aware that everyone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes were on him. And the closer he got to the giant, the smaller he felt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s you\u8217\'92re name, boy?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Ayram mused. \u8220\'93Mandri, look at me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri looked into Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dark eyes and was struck dumb by fear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You been crying, boy? \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shook his head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your eyes are red and witless. Puffy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch Elrahet stepped forward. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93His body has not recovered from death,\u8221\'94 she grumbled, leaning on her gnarled cane. \u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s stuffed with blood.\u8221\'94 Under the shadow of her cowl was a sneering squint that folded so much aged skin around her eyes that the eyes themselves were little more than black seeds thumb-pressed into her sockets. And they were moving, they flitted around Mandri\u8217\'92s figure as if they could see the smell of death exuding out of him. Eventually they fixed on his wounded arm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How is it?\u8221\'94 she asked flatly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri raised his poulticed wrist. It was repulsive. The once-white linen was stained brown and black, and tufts of vegetative matter sprouted out between the gaps in the slap-dash wrapping, and oozing out alongside was that dark, unsightly ooze.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t feel a thing,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered as he turned it over, marveling at the incongruity. Indeed, he felt nothing at all, not only an absence of feeling, of pain, but an absence of anger, too\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 these bandits had stolen his hand and he didn\u8217\'92t much care.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s good,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s bad,\u8221\'94 the witch corrected. \u8220\'93He must feel the hand to work it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram towered over Mandri and set his own great hand upon Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s no matter,\u8221\'94 he said, inflecting his words with encouragement. He spun Mandri around to face Obo and the rest of the Ayramun, and then he bent down so that his deep voice rattled Mandri\u8217\'92s bones. \u8220\'93I want you to command it,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93You have been made this Mazid\u8217\'92s Minder. Command it to kneel to me. If you command it to do anything other than kneel, I\u8217\'92m going to crush your spine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hand shifted to the back of Mandri\u8217\'92s neck, and the calloused weight of it was a stark reminder of Mandri\u8217\'92s own soft and sinewy self, which was easily broken.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram gave his hand a slight, yet terrifying squeeze, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t been alive long, yet here he was again, being subjected to an absurd trial at the urging of a much bigger man. Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You want me to get him to kneel?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did I not make myself clear?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I\u8217\'92ve only seen a Minder and Mazid once before, and that was a fleeting glimpse. I\u8217\'92m not exactly sure of how this is all supposed to work. What do you want me to do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want you to stop talking and tell the creature to kneel.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pale skin was blinding in the brightness of noon-day sun. Mandri stared blankly and tried to summon some guiding sensation which might uncover a Minder\u8217\'92s instict, but the only thing he felt was the weight of Ayram\u8217\'92s hand on the back of his neck. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He took a deep breath, steadied himself, and hoping to get it over with, he issued a soft but direct, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kneel.\u8221\'94 It was a command, but a pleading one, the only kind of command that Mandri respected. But of course, Obo did not move, instead, Obo cocked his ear and asked, \u8220\'93Could you say that again? I didn\u8217\'92t quite catch your meaning.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri risked an over-the-shoulder glance at the giant who towered up behind him. All he could see of his head from this angle was the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bread-loaf beard and his sharp nose poking out it. Mandri said, \u8220\'93It seems he doesn\u8217\'92t want to kneel.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stern gaze swiveled down and Mandri was quick to look away before he was caught in it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Puff out your chest,\u8221\'94 Ayram bellowed. \u8220\'93Say it with conviction. Think of yourself as a fat Junkite Queen hungry for meat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri focused again on Obo, , when Elrahet ambled into view, her legs slapping the black tatters of her robe, flinging them to and fro. Her beady eyes still fretted over Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s figure. She waved Ayram away with a flick of her knobby fingers, and the giant grunted but obeyed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch circled Mandri and mumbled a guttural speech devoid of natural pauses where she might take a breath. As the mumblings flowed out of her, her right hand plunged into her ragged robes emerged with a curved, golden knife. It was knife Mandri had seen before, in fact it looked exactly like the knife that the demon witch Pell had used to slaughter his ox.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Stare at the Mazid,\u8221\'94 the old witch said when she noticed him noticing her. \u8220\'93Think of nothing but the Mazid.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stiffened in fright, and tried his best to follow orders, but that was hard to do because he had seen the witch lick her withered lips at the sight of his stomach. And she was holding that accursed knife. It was gleaming in the light of the sun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at the Mazid!\u8221\'94 Elrahet barked. \u8220\'93Think of nothing but the the Mazid!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Just as soon as Mandri refocused his attention on Obo, she lashed out with her blade faster than Mandri could flinch. She slashed out at his stomach, a chopping-slash right in front of his belly-button, had the oddest effect\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he stiffened up, an involuntary jerk, and  that this witch was ensorcling him through . He could actually feel Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mumbling pulling his mind down out of himself and into the present moment, enthralling him to the sight of Obo. It was a similar effect to the juice of black-spotted burgeons, this narrowing of the world between Mandri and his object of interest. And when the witch\u8217\'92s mumblings crescendoed into a growl, she\u8217\'92d lash out with her blade and slash the air just above his skin\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 above his arm, his shoulder, his face\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and each time Mandri felt some part of himself snap, like every time she cut the air she cut one of his desires, unmooring his mind from thoughts of the future so that it would drop a little further down into the moment. Soon it seemed that the only functional parts of him were his legs, which kept him standing, and his vision, though that, too, was blurring, until the limestone pit dissolved into a whitish pucker behind Obo\u8217\'92s unfinished face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A strange, bald face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It needed eyebrows.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Command it to kneel!\u8221\'94 Elrahet growled. \u8220\'93Shout it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 An urge bubbled up out of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gut and he vomited out a shout, \u8220\'93Kneel!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The word flew out of his mouth was not in his own voice, or at least it seemed that way to his inner ear. It was magic. The witch had conjured magic from Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Spark, and Mandri knew it was magic for the sand shivered under his feet and a cool air blew up from nowhere and billowed the hem of his robe, and as the word passed out of his throat it pulled out with it all of Mandri\u8217\'92s energy, and when it was gone his stomach seemed to implode from the sudden emptiness. He wheezed and doubled over in pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When he caught his breath he looked up, and Obo was still standing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The effort amused Obo. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come now, Mandri,\u8221\'94 he said with a relaxed smile. \u8220\'93If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s great hand gripped Mandri\u8217\'92s shoulder again and straightened him out. \u8220\'93Get it to kneel,\u8221\'94 said Ayram. The seriousness of the threat in his voice was hard , as a voice so deep made every word seem dangerous.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Feel for your hand,\u8221\'94 Elrahet stressed as she waddled again into view. \u8220\'93Your hand clutches the Mazid\u8217\'92s heart. Use it. Feel your pulse in your fingers. Squeeze.\u8221\'94 She motioned for Mandri to raise his arm and he did. He held that weedy poultice out before him and she began again to circle. Before he could scramble his mind back into order, the witch\u8217\'92s mumblings were dragging him back down into her thrall. He aimed his handless wrist at the Obo as if it were a weapon, and his mind ricocheted off the monstrous thought that his movements were not his own and he plunged into a vision of his severed hand stuck inside Obo\u8217\'92s chest. His pale, dead fingers were squeezing a malformed slug of muscle that passed for a heart.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He screamed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93KNEEL!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The word rattled the pit\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chalky walls, then rebounded back at him, shook his own heart in its calloused cage and sped into the cave behind, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back out. That this powerful shout had come from his own throat was the least incredible thing, for the air between himself and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if his very shout had somehow thwacked the dusty ground between like an invisible whip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether. For a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Mandri\u8217\'92s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Almost!\u8221\'94 said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had well and stolen all of Mandri\u8217\'92s strength. He wobbled and collapsed to his knees.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh,\u8221\'94 said Obo, a smirk playing on his lips. \u8220\'93Is that what you wanted me to do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The passing of the word through Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body robbed him of his ability to breathe. He floundered in the sand, gasping. Ayram strolled right by so that he towered towered over Obo. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you not kneeling?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri could only see Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s legs behind Ayram\u8217\'92s wall of a figure, but those legs were standing defiant. Obo said plainly, \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not kneeling because I don\u8217\'92t want to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram stepped aside to give Obo a view of Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is your Minder, yes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is,\u8221\'94 Obo answered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why are you not kneeling?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because his will is weak.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri buried his face into the crook of his arm as he cowered against the gawking stares. Everyone in the pit was judging him. But they were idiots\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this was their failure, not his. He would have leapt to his own defense if the witch\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s malevolent curses hadn\u8217\'92t sapped him of his strength.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In truth,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93A Minder cannot command me to do anything.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram expressed his disbelief with a blank stare, to which Obo replied, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A Minder cannot command me, but they }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 can}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  stop me from doing something they don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want me to do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram thought for a moment, then said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don\u8217\'92t care which.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri heard Obo give a bright snicker before he clarified, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Think of a Minder\u8217\'92s connection to a Mazid as a leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash as much as possible, and with a short leash, yes, there is some measure control, but Mandri does not have the right style of will for it. With him, my leash is quite long.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram took time to chew on Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words. By now Mandri was peeking again and he could see that Ayram\u8217\'92s displeasure genuine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why haven\u8217\'92t you split us all with Mazidfire?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because Mazidfire requires a Minder with the will to wield it. The power that dwells in my stomach is the only part of me over which I have no control.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram stared blankly at Obo, weighing his words, then finally and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Someone toss me a dagger.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet. Ayram picked it up, and the blade was no bigger than a butterknife\u8217\'92s compared to his great hand. The giant stepped towards the Obo and set the blade\u8217\'92s edge up tight against the side of Obo\u8217\'92s neck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kneel,\u8221\'94 he said gruffly. The threat in his eyes was clear, but Obo was unmoved. The Mazid said simply, \u8220\'93Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from my new Minder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram rotated the dagger so that its sharp point was digging into Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s skin. \u8220\'93If you don\u8217\'92t do what I want, then I have no use for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is it Mazidfire you want?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is. But kneeling will do for now.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then I suggest you direct your attention towards your choice of Minder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram pushed the tip of the dagger into Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s flesh, more in curiosity than cruelty. It was a scene reminiscent of some sword-swallower\u8217\'92s trick\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the blade was three inches deep in Obo\u8217\'92s neck, and while Obo\u8217\'92s whole body was tense his face was completely blank, devoid of anxious pain. And when Ayram withdrew the blade, only a few drops of blood trickled out from the wound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet stepped forth once again and cleared her throat. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If the boy can\u8217\'92t control the creature, I will find someone who will.\u8221\'94 There was menace in her words for Mandri, but mostly they were meant to soothe Ayram\u8217\'92s obvious frustration. The giant\u8217\'92s head was downcast, glaring at the sand. Eventually he began to pace back and forth, slowly. His left hand clasped his right behind his back, and his right hand twirled the bone-handled blade like a toothpick in between dexterous fingers. It was a grand show of hard thinking, one which went on for far too long but everyone was keen to indulge it. Mandri began to suspect that Ayram\u8217\'92s sharp, cutting gaze was a mask which hid a mind no more capable than the average outland poke\u8217\'92s. All this thoughtful pacing was a performance meant to give his followers the impression that he was more than a giant brute, he was a thinking man who still had moves to play.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Stopping right before Mandri. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is wrong with you? You\u8217\'92re free to speak.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t answer, Ayram squatted down so that his great head was .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You ever killed anyone before?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did my people explain to you what this is all about?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I need you to use that Mazid to kill a thing for me. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kill what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you ever seen a demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I aim to kill the demon of demons. It\u8217\'92s a beast called the Amalgamete.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sounds difficult.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s also called the god swallower.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you need the Mazidfire to kill it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do. And I need a Minder who can summon it. If you can\u8217\'92t do that, then we\u8217\'92re going to have to take your hand out of that Mazid\u8217\'92s chest, and that involves killing you first, you understand?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you want to give kneeling another try?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I may interject, I have a potential solution to this little quandary we all find ourselves in.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you?\u8221\'94 said Ayram, feigning interest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It seems I have something you want, and it just so happens that you have something I want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What I want, you can\u8217\'92t give me. You said so yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, that is true, given present circumstances. But if circumstances were to change\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Speak cleanly, Mazid. Do you want a bargain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, a bargain,\u8221\'94 said Obo, nodding.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A few chuckles rose from amongst Ayramun, and Mandri thought he knew why\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t bargain with Hrks,\u8221\'94 Ayram said bluntly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then don\u8217\'92t call it bargaining. We\u8217\'92ll share gestures of goodwill. We can start small, if you like. I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don\u8217\'92t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. Give me a mouthful of water and I will kneel. I will grovel, should it please you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why should I bargain at all if you can\u8217\'92t muster Mazidfire?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I will kill whatever you want if you give me what I want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the unnamed Ayramun and demanded their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram snatched it out of the air, and he unplugged the cork then took a drink. His beard bulged as he swished the water around his mouth, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he wondered aloud, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t know the Mazidai needed water.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 Obo answered. \u8220\'93Again, this is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of goodwill.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left brow jumped into a skeptical arc. \u8220\'93You first,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Give us a gesture of goodwill, to demonstrate the principle.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo promptly dropped to one knee and bowed his head. Incredibly, there was no mockery in it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this bend of body and limb was honest, pure obeisance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Beautiful,\u8221\'94 Ayram mused. \u8220\'93But it goes against my nature to give a Hrk water.\u8221\'94 He let the statement hang in the air for dramatic effect, and when Obo raise his eyes in expectation, Ayram tossed the waterskin. The circle of Ayramun broke into a hushed chorus of mumbled grumbles and hisses at the sight of the skin flying through the air and landing against Obo\u8217\'92s genuflecting knee. Ayram silenced them all with a glare, and Obo, for his part, picked the waterskin up, nodded, then simply set it aside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So what will it be, then?\u8221\'94 Ayram asked. \u8220\'93What will you take in exchange for killing my enemy?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want my freedom.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kill the Amalgamete, and I\u8217\'92ll let you run into whatever hole you like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I meant true freedom. A mere pseudospark dwells inside my stomach, and it is a Minder\u8217\'92s will which beats my heart. If I had my own bright Spark, then my body and my fire would be my own and I would use it to kill your Amalgamete.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face contorted as he grappled with Obo\u8217\'92s request. \u8220\'93Are you asking me to give you a Divine Spark?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo pointed to Mandri. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into that boy\u8217\'92s body.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrank inside his loose robe as all eyes suddenly swiveled to him, and these were hard, angry gazes, fixed as such from long years spent squinting against the sun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you could infuse Mandri\u8217\'92s corpse with a Spark,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93Then do the same for me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram turned to his scarecrow witch. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can this be done?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet had been standing perfectly still through all of this\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only her eyes moved, and their movement away from Mandri towards the Mazid was unsettlingly reluctant. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I cleansed the boy\u8217\'92s Spark,\u8221\'94 she said gruffly. \u8220\'93I did not breathe him a new one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then if it can\u8217\'92t be done,\u8221\'94 Ayram shrugged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hand twisted tight on her sand-smoothed cane, and to Mandri\u8217\'92s surprise, she sneered at her leader. \u8220\'93I did not say it could not be done. A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require a sacrifice greater than any here can summon. Better to wring the will out of the boy. Or, find another Minder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Agreed,\u8221\'94 said Ayram before turning to Obo and adding, \u8220\'93Even if she could do it, we cannot trust you.\u8221\'94 Then he beckoned to his followers and barked, \u8220\'93Moto and Tob! Come hold it flat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Big bush Tob and an athletic Zosan man stood up and rushed over to the kneeling Obo. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand. Tob threw punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Settle down Tob,\u8221\'94 Ayram griped after Tob spat up a chunk of smoke-blacked spit onto Obo\u8217\'92s face. Tob grinned at Ayram\u8217\'92s chiding remark, though he did settle down as Ayram wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This bar was one solid piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head. At its top, the iron splayed out into a chisel, while at the bottom, the iron belled out into a sphere the size of Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s giant fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled the bar once as if it were as light as an oilwood spear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I can\u8217\'92t make you kneel on my own terms,\u8221\'94 he said to Obo, \u8220\'93Then you won\u8217\'92t need your legs.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He marched towards Obo with menace in his step.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no need for this,\u8221\'94 Obo protested, but Ayram was a man who could be moved.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He raised his spear above Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s thigh, and Mandri shut his eyes. And while Mandri could hide from the sight of the coming affair, but he could not from the sound. When the chisel-head stabbed into Obo\u8217\'92s flesh it snapped the bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Obo did not cry out, Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t help but sneak a peek. There nearby was the Zosan, Moto, steadying Obo\u8217\'92s left hip as he hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons, and they repeated this gruesome work on Obo\u8217\'92s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Through it all, Obo did made no sound.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled past Mandri and into their cave. Forty stopped at Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s side and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked, he glanced back towards Obo, whose blood-stub of a body was a frightful sight, and just as Mandri\u8217\'92s heart was strafed by the shame of bearing witness, Obo caught his eye, smiled, and gave him another wink.}}
