He was still recovering from the rigor of death, and he stretched out his legs as the sun crossed over to noon, such that its light shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. Most of the Ayramun retreated into the tunnel. Mandri preferred the warmth and had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd of brown ragged men and women came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, chattering excitedly like children. Then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention, and there, out of the shadows, came Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had never seen a man so big in all his life.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen giants in paintings, but those were paintings. The genre of the conquering hero was something of a joke amongst artists, a tired genre, an unreality meant to lift up ordinary men in the eyes of their subjects. But Ayram was no ordinary man. The first thought that came to Mandri\u8217\'92s mind was, \u8216\'91Arnaggu\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Arnaggu is the first Hrkan Lord, a true conquering hero, and in some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towers above the sandswept Forni plain. It is a terrifying piece. The relief itself sits four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicts stretches all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image is a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen, limbs splayed out like flattened lizards, with torsos bared and hips skirted like slaves, their faces are fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is ten times as large as any other. He stands at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage, and his upper torso and head are the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seems to be tearing himself out of the rock, eyes wild, teeth bared, as if he\u8217\'92d just heard whispers of rebellion and was rising to the challenge.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen. Despite that prickling sense of awe that stippled his skin, he was wholly unimpressed with it. He saw past all of its tricks, the over-reliance on scale\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 make something big enough and a person standing next to it is bound to feel small, and here, Arnaggu had taken a shortcut to scale by carving his image into a mountain, and so the viewer is forced to contend with not only the relief but the entirety of the rock. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Not even the great relief of Arnaggu could convince Mandri of the truth behind the conceit of the conquering hero. No man was born to conquer. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen Hrkan Lords in the flesh, and they were ordinary men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram looked like Arnaggu himself stepping out from that rock relief, for he was a true giant, and his stern countenance seemed carved from stone. His hair was wrapped up in a black headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a round, black, bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style of beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet, who was himself named after a mountain. Ayram wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the man was a true giant. And the way he moved, with his too-long legs wrapped in faded black wool and swinging in a loping gait, he seemed half-built from a spider.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, he carried under his arm the body of a conquered wretch, none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo, whose bald head was twisted the right way around, eyes blinking in the sun. Set against Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bronzed skin, black robes, and giant frame, Obo was as pale and as unseemly as a naked rat. Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him, all staring at the Mazid like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for their master to divvy up the meal.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The awkward nakedness of Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s unnatural body drew hearty jeers. Tob was quick to point out that this Mazid didn\u8217\'92t have an asshole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No wonder he acts like his shit don\u8217\'92t stink,\u8221\'94 he said, smirking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It does when it comes out the mouth,\u8221\'94 said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bet it does!\u8221\'94 Tob roared. He slapped his knee and then killed the joke by hitting it square in the face\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8220\'93Shit comes out its mouth because its full of shit!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His belly-rumbling laugh was followed a storm of obscenities that rained down upon poor Obo. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, beard frowning, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But Obo bore their insults with a casual shrug and the indifferent bearing of a bullied child who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo smiled as if to gloat. This triggered another roar of fury and renewed calls for the Mazid\u8217\'92s head on a spike. Ayram settled them all down with a shrill, sharp, two-fingered whistle. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then Ayram spoke. His voice was low and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous chest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet!\u8221\'94 he shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri took the word to be some obscure Old Jandri expression. Then out of the cave came a short old woman hobbling along with a cane. She was clouded in a mass of ruffled up black tatters, and she kept her shawled head downcast in deference. With her spine as bowed as it was, her head was no taller than Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She was not alone. Stumbling along behind her was a Jandri girl wrapped in a mottled, brown blanket. She leaned against Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stooped back, and the pair moved with deliberate care as the girl was clearly drugged, or drunk. Mandri guessed drunk because she walked with that familiar rhythmless, scuffing, shuffle of blurred instinct. She would have fallen at least twice if Elrahet was not there to steady the load. The third time, Elrahet shrugged and let the girl fall.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Toughen up!\u8221\'94 the old woman snipped as the girl caught herself on hand and knee.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When this girl looked up her eyes locked on the Mazid, and her chin jerked up. The sun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s light revealed to all a sickly pale face, which is no small thing for a Jandri girl reddened by kell oil and the sun. Her high and narrow cheeks were troubled by a huge mess of tousled brown hair and a clear lack of sleep, though her dark eyes were set in cold resolve as she fought back a grimace as she stood back up. Huddled up as she was under the blanket, the source of her pain was not clear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram grabbed the girl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder and pulled her up straight. He shook her gently, and he called her name to bring her to attention. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Purl,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Purl, look at me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl looked up at the giant with bleared amazement. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s time,\u8221\'94 said Ayram. \u8220\'93I want you to command the Mazid. Command it to kneel to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram let go of Purl and she, unbalanced, swayed into his hip. Ayram caught her, held her steady, then pointed his long arm at Obo and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl poked a trembling hand out of her blanket and rubbed her swollen eyes. Then she took a deep breath, steadied herself, and when she was good and ready, she commanded the Mazid to Kneel. Her voice was soft and troubled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kneel.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo did not move. Instead, he said, untroubled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Could you say that again? I didn\u8217\'92t quite catch your meaning.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Purl clenched her teeth and puffed her chest. With a snarl reminiscent of the old Junkite Queens, she bellowed, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kneel!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri thought he saw the sand shiver under Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bare feet, and he squirmed as a cool air blew down from nowhere and brushed his flouncy curls and kissed his warm skin. If the girl had just spent her magic, it was a poor effort, for Obo did not kneel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come now,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His dismissiveness enraged the girl. She tossed off her blanket, and along with it went any sign of the lethargy and pain which plagued her features. She held out her left arm, and there her hand was missing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only recently severed off. The resulting nub was poulticed and bandaged tight, though without much care, as strands of wet and green leafy weeds dangled out of it. She aimed this weedy thing at the Mazid as if it were a weapon. Mandri understood, then what was happening\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Purl was Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s new Minder, and her dainty, severed hand was stuck inside Obo\u8217\'92s chest, squeezing the malformed slug of muscle that passed for a heart.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93KNEEL!\u8221\'94 she screamed, and her shout shook Mandri\u8217\'92s heart in its calloused cage. The word rattled the pit\u8217\'92s chalky walls, then rebounded into the cave behind her, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back out. That this powerful shout had come from such a frail and ailing girl was the least incredible thing, for the air between Purl and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if the girl\u8217\'92s very shout had somehow thwacked the sandy ground like an invisible whip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether. For a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Purl\u8217\'92s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Almost!\u8221\'94 said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had sapped Purl of her strength. She wobbled and collapsed to her knees.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh,\u8221\'94 he said amused, \u8220\'93is that what you wanted me to do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stifled a snicker at this brazen taunt. The old woman, Elrahet, hissed at Obo, then sneered at the defeated Purl. Ayram sighed, then he strolled over to Obo so that he towered over the creature. He asked the Mazid,\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you not kneeling?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo stood defiant, naked and without shame. He met Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s withering eye with a blank stare and said plainly, \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not kneeling because I don\u8217\'92t want to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram rubbed his tired brow and spared look behind the girl, who was doubled over in pain. He said to Obo, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She is your Minder, yes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why can\u8217\'92t she command you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because her will is weak. In truth, a Minder cannot command me to do anything.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen a Minder move a Mazid\u8217\'92s limbs.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, a Minder can\u8217\'92t command me, but they }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 can}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  stop me from doing something they don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want me to do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram thought for a moment and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don\u8217\'92t care which.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To command is to direct, to stop is to interfere. Think of a Minder\u8217\'92s connection to a Mazid as a leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash as much as possible, and when that leash is short enough, there is some measure control. But your girl does not have the right kind of will for it. My leash, it seems, is quite long.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram chewed on Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words. He seemed as if he did not like the taste.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why haven\u8217\'92t you split us all with Mazidfire?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My leash is short enough, at least, to stop me from doing anything like that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram muttered a frustrated curse under his breath, then said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Someone toss me a dagger.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet. Ayram picked it up. The blade seemed like a toothpick in his great hand. He stepped towards the Mazid, reached down, and put the blade\u8217\'92s edge up tight against the side of Obo\u8217\'92s neck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kneel,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from the girl.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram rotated the dagger so that its point was digging into Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s skin. He said through gritted teeth, \u8220\'93If I can\u8217\'92t get you to do what I want, then I have no use for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then I suggest you direct your attention towards the girl.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram pushed the tip of the dagger into Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s flesh, more in curiosity than cruelty. He pushed the blade a few inches into the neck. Obo didn\u8217\'92t cringe from pain, though his whole bald body was tense, reminiscent of some sword-swallower mid-trick. When Ayram withdrew the blade, barely a trickle of blood spilled out from the wound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The giant tossed the knife away in disgust. He stepped back and scratched his tufted chin, then massaged his frustrated brow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Old Elrahet interrupted his fretting by saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If Purl can\u8217\'92t do it, we find someone who will.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram glared at the old woman, effectively shutting her up. Then he continued his deep rumination. It was such a show of hard thinking that Mandri began to suspect that the man wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t actually thinking at all, and that this was a show for his followers, to give them the impression that he still had moves to play.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo said aloud, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have a potential solution.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you?\u8221\'94 said Ayram, feigning interest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have something I want, and I have something you want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A bargain, is it? A little give and take with a puppet like you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, a bargain.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A few chuckles rose from amongst Ayramun. Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t treat with Hrks,\u8221\'94 Ayram said flatly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am not a Hrk. I am beholden to you, and I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don\u8217\'92t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. If you give me a mouthful of water then I will kneel to you. I will grovel, if you like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the unnamed Ayramun and demanded their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram caught it, opened it up and took a drink. He swished it around his mouth, bulging his beard, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t know the Mazidai needed water.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93This is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of good faith.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You first, then,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. \u8220\'93Give us a gesture of goodwill\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 to demonstrate the principle.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo immediately got down on one knee. He even bent his head in supplication, and it seemed his back was bent by honest, pure obeisance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a curious creature,\u8221\'94 said Ayram, almost impressed. Obo raised his head in expectation, but Ayram added, \u8220\'93It goes against my nature to give a Hrk water, Hrkan puppet or no. I hope you understand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93However\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 said Ayram, letting the word hang in the air for dramatic effect. \u8220\'93I will give you whatever you want if you do just one thing for me. There is a man\u8230\'85a creature\u8230\'85an abomination, I want you to kill.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would kill anyone you like, but if I can\u8217\'92t trust you to give me water, how can I trust you to give me my \u8216\'91heart\u8217\'92s greatest desire\u8217\'92?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram stood stunned, because it was a good point. He begrudgingly bent down and handed the waterskin over to the Obo. This action was met with much grumbling on behalf of the Ayramun, but Ayram silenced them all with a glare. Obo, for his part, did not drink from the waterskin, he simply set it down next to his knee.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So who is it you want me to kill?\u8221\'94 Obo asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A  god-swallower. The demon of demons. A beast called the Amalgamete.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve never heard heard of it. But sure, I\u8217\'92ll do it, if you give me what I want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is your price?\u8221\'94 Ayram asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Freedom.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll let you run into whatever hole you like once you kill it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I mean true freedom. I have only a mere pseudospark pulsing inside my belly\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it is a Minder\u8217\'92s will which thumps my heart. I ask that you give me my own bright Spark. I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into that boy\u8217\'92s body.\u8221\'94 He pointed to Mandri, and suddenly all eyes turned to him. Mandri was suddenly aware of his own tawdry self and . Obo continued, \u8220\'93If you could infuse Mandri\u8217\'92s corpse with a Spark which was not his own, then do the same for me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram eyed his old witch and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can this be done?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet was standing as still as scarecrow, staring at Obo, her old joints seemingly stuck as the layers of black tatters draped on her leathery bones drifted against the breeze. She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require an act of creation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram shrugged and mused, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If it can\u8217\'92t be done.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet growled, and her hand twisted tight on her cane as she said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I did not say it could not be done. But I won\u8217\'92t do it. We cannot trust the creature. Better to wring the will out of the girl, or find another Minder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I agree,\u8221\'94 said Ayram. \u8220\'93Now, Moto and Tob, come hold it flat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Bushy Tob and a tall black Zozan stood up and rushed over to the kneeling Mazid. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand, throwing punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Settle down Tob,\u8221\'94 Ayram said as he wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar. This bar was one piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head, and at one end was a splayed chisel, and at the other was a round ball the size of his own great fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled it as if it were a spear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I can\u8217\'92t make you kneel on my own terms, then you won\u8217\'92t need your legs. And we can\u8217\'92t risk you running away again. I hope you understand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Unfortunately, I do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram raised his spear. Mandri shut his eyes. Mandri could hide from the sight but he could not from the sound of Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chisel-head spear stabbing into Obo\u8217\'92s upper leg, snapping the bone. And he couldn\u8217\'92t help but sneak a peek as the Zosan, Moto, knelt down next to Obo\u8217\'92s left hip, and hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons, and they began their gruesome work again on Obo\u8217\'92s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Through it all, Obo did not squeak or speak a sound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When it was done, and Obo was legless, Ayram said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Someone bag the Mazid up! We\u8217\'92ve got a long walk ahead of us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled into their cave to grab more. Forty came over to Mandri and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked across the pit, he glanced towards Obo, whose freshly broken body was a frightful sight. And just as Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s heart was strafed by the shame of even bearing witness, that damned bald Mazid looked him right in the eye, smiled, and gave him another wink.}
