\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 \~but such skepticism is usually attributable to a lack of familiarity with the mathematical and/or biological foundations of population genetics (as pointed out, for example, by\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#charlesworth-etal-1980"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Charlesworth et al. 1980}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ).}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Before proceeding, a fundamental flaw in the argument of Behe and Snoke needs to be pointed out. Although the authors claim to be evaluating whether Darwinian processes are capable of yielding new multi-residue functions, the model that they present is non- Darwinian (}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#king-and-jukes-1969"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 King and Jukes 1969}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ). Contrary to the principles espoused by Darwin, that is, that evolution generally proceeds via functional intermediate states, Behe and Snoke consider a situation in which the intermediate steps to a new protein are neutral and involve nonfunctional products.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 in that the intermediate states of protein evolution involve functional products (in accordance with Darwin) with no immediate positive effects on organismal fitness (consistent with the assumptions of Behe and Snoke). Using conservative biological assumptions, it is shown that the origins of new protein functions are easily explained in terms of well-understood population- genetic mechanisms.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 As in\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#behe-and-snoke-2004"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Behe and Snoke (2004)}}{\f0\fs24\b0 , this adaptation is assumed to be acquired at the expense of an essential function of the ancestral protein, so that the new function can only be permanently established via gene duplication, with one of the copies maintaining the original function. The Behe-Snoke assumption that a selective advantage only results after both participating residues are in place is also adhered to. However, two significant deviations from the model of Behe and Snoke are incorporated.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 First, Behe and Snoke start with a duplicate locus that has spread throughout the base population, although they also assume that most gene copies have actually been permanently silenced by previous mutational events, the number of functional copies actually varying arbitrarily among individuals (without upper bound) as a consequence of unknown deterministic mechanisms. In contrast, the model presented here starts with a more realistic base population harboring a single locus in all individuals. A duplicate gene then arises in a single random member of the population, as must always be the case with a mutational change. With many fewer initial targets for mutation, and the vast majority of new duplicates being rapidly lost by genetic drift, this starting condition imposes a much greater challenge for the evolution of a new gene function than that assumed by Behe and Snoke.}
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Second, Behe and Snoke assume that all mutational changes contributing to the origin of a new multi-residue function must arise after the duplication process. They justify this assumption by stating that the majority of nonneutral point mutations to a gene yield a nonfunctional protein. To stretch this statement to imply that all amino acid changes lead to nonfunctionalization is a gross mischaracterization of one of the major conclusions from studies on protein biology\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 most protein-coding genes are tolerant of a broad spectrum of amino acid substitutions (}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#kimura-1983"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Kimura 1983}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ;\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#taverna-and-goldstein-2002a"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Taverna and Goldstein 2002a}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ,}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#taverna-and-goldstein-2002b"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 b}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ).

Even for the highly conserved catalytic core regions of proteins, approximately one-third of amino acid sites can tolerate substitutions (}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#materon-and-palzkill-2001"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Materon and Palzkill 2001}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ;\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#guo-etal-2004"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Guo et al. 2004}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ).

\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 A deeper understanding of the fraction of amino-acid-altering mutations that have mild enough effects to permit persistence in a population comes from observations on within- and between-species variation in protein sequences (}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#li-1997"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Li 1997}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ;\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#keightley-and-eyre-walker-2000"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Keightley and Eyre-Walker 2000}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ;\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#fay-and-wu-2003"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Fay and Wu 2003}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ), which generally indicate that 10% to 50% of replacement mutations are capable of being maintained within populations at moderate frequencies by selection-mutation balance and/or going to fixation. Because there is strong heterogeneity of substitution rates among amino acid sites (}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#yang-1996"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 Yang 1996}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ), these average constraint levels should not be generalized across all sites, many of which evolve at rates close to neutrality. Thus, most proteins in all organisms harbor tens to hundreds of amino acid sites available for evolutionary modification prior to gene duplication.}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Under this assumption, the first step in the evolution of a two-residue function potentially resides at the ancestral locus, where two alternative classes of alleles may be present prior to duplication: those containing a key amino acid at one of the potentially participating sites (type 2), and those with none (type 1) (Fig. 1}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2253472/#f1"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 \~\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u9654\'3F}}{\f0\fs24\b0 ).\~}{ }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Successful establishment of the new function (neofunctionalization of one of the copies) requires the founding pair of linked gene duplicates to (1) initially attain a high frequency; (2) acquire the mutations essential to the expression of the new function (allelic types 6 or 7) while en route or subsequent to fixation; and (3) be preserved by positive selection subsequent to the origin of the new function. All three processes occur in parallel with a background production of null alleles. The two central issues to be resolved are then: (1) How frequently will a duplication event lead to neofunctionalization; and (2) How long will this take? Answers to these questions can be acquired by recursively following the population through the sequential steps of mutation, selection, and random sampling.}{ }

Moreover, depending on the environmental context, the same consortium may switch from one of these conditions to another. One operational distinction between an organelle and an endosymbiont is that the former relies on protein import from the host cell for at least some cell functions other than nutrition (Cavalier-Smith and Lee 1985). }

This left open the question as to whether differences at the next highest level of organization \endash  the cell \endash  might also be a product of effectively neutral processes. One might anticipate that the higher the level of organization and the closer to outward phenotypic expression, the more likely it is that natural selection will be fully responsible for patterns of variation. With this reasoning, some would even argue that none of the internal molecular and cellular details matter. However, multiple observations summarized in the preceding chapters make clear that this is not the case }
\par\plain 
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {Evolutionary biology is more than the application of phylogenetic comparative analyses and the concoction of adaptive hypotheses for observed historical patterns. Understanding the mechanisms by which evolution proceeds requires an appreciation of the functional constraints on cells imposed by the historical roots of biology\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s invariants (e.g., the dependence on DNA-based genomes, RNA-based transcriptomes, protein- and lipid-based infrastructures, and the reliance on ATP as a supplier of energy). . As the biochemical, bioenergetic, and biophysical properties of life\u8217\'92s cellular components ultimately define the limited ways by which mutational processes can introduce variation into populations, a mechanistic understanding of evolution is inconceivable without information on its material basis. Likewise, conditional on the material endowment of life, the imposition of key population-genetic features dictate the paths of possible evolutionary trajectories, defining the types of changes that are open vs. closed to exploitation by natural selection and mutational biases }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {. Mutations are particulate in nature, with effects that are typically small and deleterious, and the transmission of alleles across generations is a stochastic process, with the role of chance in evolution varying by several orders of magnitude across phylogenetic lineages. Every genomic nucleotide site in every species is subject to mutational change and to the vagaries of genetic drift. However, genomes are also finite in size, and these matters along with issues such as recombination rates and nonadditive gene interactions dictate the kinds of pathways that are open to evolutionary exploration. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Most notably, the capacity of natural selection to use genetic fuel to drive the expansion of biological diversity has significant bounds dictated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing effective population sizes. Not all mutations are available for adaptive evolutionary utilization, as the effective size of a population dictates the granularities of mutational effects that are visible to the eyes of natural selection. In small populations, adaptive change can only proceed by use of beneficial mutations of relatively large effects, and mildly deleterious mutations cannot be purged. In contrast, in large populations, evolution is much more fine-tuned, as its arsenal expands to mutations with very small effects. Thus, even in the ideal case in which mutation and selection pressures operate in identical ways, phylogenetic lineages are expected to vary in their response to selection, simply as a consequence of variation in the power of random genetic drift. Drift not modifies the availability of existing variation, but through history defines the genomic architectures from which mutational changes can be built. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {evolutionary-genetics theory has been very good at defining how changes are expected to proceed in a generic way, usually in terms of changes in allele frequencies without any explicit reference to phenotypes. The next step in the development of a more mature science of evolutionary biology is to elucidate from first principles the connections between molecular/cell-level features and their selective consequences \endash  the so-called genotype-phenotype-fitness mapping. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Humans are better at being human than are bacteria, and bacteria are better at carrying out microbial functions than vertebrates, but one cannot directly compare the genetic fitnesses of reproductively isolated organisms out of context with their ecologies.

Nonetheless, even where performances can be compared in an absolute sense, simpler organisms generally come out on top. }

\par\plain {being devoid of mobile elements and generally highly depauperate of intronic DNA. I }
\par\plain 
\par\plain 
\par\plain {For example, mobile-genetic elements are a burden to host cells for two reasons: 1) each such element typically spans a few hundred to a few thousand basepairs, thereby imposing an energetic cost in terms of excess DNA synthesis; and 2) random insertions of offspring elements into novel genomic sites often have negative consequences for host-cell fitness as a consequence of gene disruption. Consistent with this view, despite having no innate immunity to mobile-element invasion, the genomes of microbial eukaryotes with relatively large effective population sizes are generally nearly devoid of such elements (as in prokaryotes); such insertions are simply kept rare in these species by purifying natural selection. Likewise, introns, which can exceed 10 kb in length in multicellular species, are an energetic burden at both the DNA and RNA levels, and also impose upon their host genes an elevated rate of mutation to defective alleles owing to the need to maintain specific splice-site recognition sequences. The fact that the smallest eukaryotic genomes contain fewer genes than bacterial genomes in cells of comparable size (Figure 24.2) makes clear that an expanded gene set is not a requirement for the development of a eukaryotic cell plan. This upholds the hypothesis that most of the changes in eukaryotic genome organization are simple by-products of the shift in the population-genetic environment permissive to the expansion of noncoding DNA. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {, species with small cells and large effective population sizes are able to selectively purge insertions of nonfunctional DNA as small as a few base pairs. In contrast, in large eukaryotic species, natural selection is essentially blind to the relative energetic costs of insertions as large as several kb }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Whatever the mechanism \endash  one or more whole-genome duplications or cumulative duplications of smaller chromosomal regions, Marakova et al. (2005) suggest that the basal increase in eukaryotic gene number may have been precipitated by a  clysmic event inducing a sudden and prolonged reduction in population size. Part of the rationale for this argument is the fact that the preservation of duplicate genes by subfunctionalization (as opposed to neofunctionalization) is facilitated in populations of small size. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Recall from Chapter 6 that subfunctionalization is a process by which duplicate genes are preserved by the complementary loss of key subfunctions. Unless there is a resolution of an adaptive conflict, no fitness gain results from such a process. Rather, there are weak bioenergetic and mutational costs of relying on duplicated genes relative to single-copy genes with the same functions. Such costs will be invisible to the eyes of purifying selection in populations of sufficiently small size. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Was this expansion of the complexity of key molecular machines of any relevance to the establishment of the altered eukaryotic cell plan or to the subsequent diversification of eukaryotes into morphologically diverse descendent lineages? Evidence that increases in multimeric complexity endow organisms with superior molecular performance or with a dramatic shift in function or diversity of functions has been elusive (Chapter 13). }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {On the other hand, as outlined in Chapter 6, the differential loss of duplicate genes in parallel lineages can passively lead to genetic map changes that manifest as post-reproductive isolating mechanisms between sister taxa, thereby establishing novel and independent lineages. This again illustrates the point that cellular modifications arising entirely by nonadaptive mechanisms may have had a foundational role in channeling downstream evolutionary pathways, not just by the creation of novel molecular functions and structures, but by expanding the potential for novel lineage proliferation }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {In situations like this, as long as the ecological conditions selecting for multicellularity remain, secondary genomic changes that refine such a state will be further promoted, provided the advantages of group living outweigh the interests of the selfish individual. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Given that signaling proteins are bioenergetically expensive, such aggregative systems are vulnerable to invasion by mutant cheaters that relinquish the costs of signaling while still profiting from the public goods produced by the remaining group members, a classical weak-link in social systems. A powerful defense against such invasions is made possible by kin recognition, wherein individuals can discriminate close from distant relatives, thereby providing opportunities for selectively dispensing benefits to individuals likely harboring similar genetic constitutions, including the underlying genes for helping (Diggle et al. 2007). }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {In principle, selection can operate at any level, discriminating among individuals within populations, among groups of individuals based on their emergent properties, or even among species on very long time scales. Moreover, a trait that is beneficial at one level need not be beneficial at another. Altruistic behavior is a prime case in point, as in this case the individual incurs a fitness cost while other members of the population experience a fitness gain. Generally, when conflicts like this arise, we expect selection at the individual level to prevail for the simple reason that the turnover rate of individuals exceeds that of groups (Williams 1966), but the distinction between individual- and group-selection becomes blurred when the interacting members of the population are close relatives. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {What is an individual from an evolutionary perspective? In almost all organisms, individuality is clearly demarcated in a physical sense, e.g., by cell membranes in the case of unicellular species, and by distinct soma in the case of multicellulars. However, things are not so clear at the genetic level, as some individuals are more closely related than others, the extreme cases being monozygotic twins or members of an asexually propagating lineage. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b1 This matters because behavior that is harmful to an individual but sufficiently beneficial to close relatives can be promoted by kin selection (Wilson 1975). For example, a suicidal behavior that sufficiently elevates the fitness of multiple clone-mates (who also carry the genes for such behavior) will be advanced by selection.  \hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 solraheen plant}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b1
\par\plain {In this sense, the division of labor in multicellular organisms, whether intrinsically beneficial or not, has a ratchet-like effect on the stability of multicellularity \endash  as cell types become more and more specialized, the likelihood of reversion of any single cell type to a form containing all ancestral-cell features necessary for independent living becomes less and less likely (Libby and Ratcliff 2014; Cooper and West 2018) }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {although it is relatively easy to understand the superficial features of the process of natural selection and to concoct adaptive stories as to how biodiversity arose, evolution is not a simple matter of natural selection pushing around mean phenotypes. Rather, the paths open to exploitation by selection are governed by the nonadaptive processes of mutation, recombination, and random genetic drift, all of which have been universal genetic forces since the origin of life. Although we do not know their relative strengths at the earliest stages in evolution, they vary by orders of magnitude among today\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s phylogenetic lineages, often in ways that scale with organism size, and there is no reason to think that this has not been the case for the past three billion or so years. Such variation has significant consequences for the emergence and utilization of the genetic material upon which natural selection acts. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Thus, whereas the technical field of population genetics is often conveniently viewed as being marginal with respect to questions concerning deep phylogenetic divergence, it is actually front and center. Likewise, while the details of molecular and cellular biology are often viewed as largely irrelevant to the ways in which populations respond to natural selection, it is precisely here that structural and functional modifications must be made to yield new phenotypes, so these details also matter. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {but not so refined as to be certain of the metabolic nature of the original foundress. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Formally demonstrating that selection operates in an effectively deterministic manner, with the underlying details being immaterial, would be a great achievement for evolutionary biology. Indeed, such a demonstration would effectively confine the future of the field to the monotonous cataloging of selective forces operating on different organisms. However, the preceding pages challenge this view. Evolutionary processes are inherently stochastic, with the potential paths open to evolutionary exploitation depending on historical contingencies and the granularity of mutational effects relative to the power of random genetic drift. This makes the development of evolutionary theory more challenging than desirable for those confined to a Darwinian mode of thinking, but a desire for simplicity is no substitute for the scientific goal of describing reality }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Although no serious scientist any longer argues against the central role played by natural selection in evolutionary change, it is now clear that organisms exposed to identical selection pressures will respond in qualitatively different ways depending on their population and cellular environments, in some cases being completely impervious to selection and largely driven by mutation pressure. Once the subject of a long debate confined to molecular evolution, effectively neutral processes now appear to have played a key role in the evolution of genome architecture, cellular features, and by extension, whole-organism biology. If this view is correct, it offers a unifying and mechanistic approach to thinking about the history and dynamics of evolutionary change across the Tree of Life and across levels of organization, liberating us from the century-old tradition of assuming that all of biodiversity reflects an optimization process dictated by a supreme designer called natural selection. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Contrary to popular belief, evolution is not on an inexorable path to build more complex organisms. There no evidence for an intrinsic advantage of complexity at the molecular, cellular, or organismal levels, and empirical observations show that simple bacteria often carry out the most basic functions of life more efficiently than do the more complex cells of eukaryotes. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {The emergence of eukaryotes from prokaryotic ancestors was accompanied by a substantial increase in genome size, particularly in multicellular lineages. However, the vast majority of this expansion is a consequence of the colonization by noncoding and nonfunctional DNA. Rather than being driven by positive selection, such changes appear to have arisen as passive by-products of a reduction in effective population size, which diminishes the ability of natural selection to oppose insertions of excess DNA. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Avoid left by the complete extinction of all animals and land plants would likely be entered quickly by multicellular descendants of unicellular species. Although the specific phenotypes to emerge under such a scenario would likely deviate from the situation today, the same syndrome of genomic changes would be expected to unfold. }
