Second, because what they did and who they were did not conform to the constantly evolving future stereotypes of what Florida is supposed to have been, they were trivialized, marginalized, or excised from the conventional florida narrative. The third thing they have in common is that the effort to turn them into nonpersons was for the most part successful, yet you can\u8217\'92t understand FLorida - and much about AMerica oo - unless you understand what they made of florida, and what florida made ofthem.}

The aim was to prevent conflict between the two catholic superpowers.

Evertything east (africa and asia) was made portugal\u8217\'92s preserve. Everything to the west was allotted to Spain. At first this partition suited the portuguese fine. BY excluding Spain from Africa and asia, it gave them a monopoly of the east indies trade. The explorations in america changed the balance of the bargain by giving spain a monopoly on the new worlds newly discovered riches. Portugal wanted a piece of the new action, so the new treaty was negotiated. It shifted the global dividing line farther west, from 100 to 370 leagues beyond the azores.

Once extracted from these paleolithic furnaces, the nuggets were broken into smaller pieces.
