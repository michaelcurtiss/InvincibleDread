\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His belly-rumbling laugh was followed by a storm of obscenities that rained down upon poor Obo\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 almost all the Ayramun joined in. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The sight of it alone was sickening, for the once-white linen was stained brown and black, and tufts of rotted vegetative matter sprouted out between the gaps in the slap-dash wrapping, and oozing out alongside was a dark, unsightly ooze.}

The calloused weight of it swallowed Mandri\u8217\'92s own soft and sinewy self, and when Ayram gave a slight, yet terrifying squeeze, Mandri nearly yelped.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had seen a Minder only once before, and that was a fleeting glimpse. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d never seen a Minder voice a command. His own word was never enough to compel anyone to do anything, so why it should work now was a mystery. \u8220\'93Tell the creature to kneel,\u8221\'94 Ayram urged.}

It was a scene reminiscent of some sword-swallower\u8217\'92s trick\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the blade was inches deep in Obo\u8217\'92s neck, and while Obo\u8217\'92s whole body was tense his face was completely unconcerned. And when Ayram withdrew the blade, only a few drops of blood trickled out from the wound.}
