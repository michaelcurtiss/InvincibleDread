\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The needle slurred some notes but he was used to that. He sat at the edge of the room, where he could feel the kitchen sun and look at Laura\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face. The music joined them edgewise. He believed he could enter her reverie. He could know her, almost know her, feel her innocence through the music, know the girl again, the spinsterly twelve-year--old who walked behind her parents in the street, he could see her in the face of the of the somber older sister, she was almost there, the girl, in the pouches and moles and smoky hair.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was a brief moment in one of the pieces, after passagework of mellow recollection, when something dark seemed to enter, the solist\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s let hand urging the tempo, and it made her raise an arm, slowly, a gesture of half shock, thoughtful and fraught - she\u8217\'92d heard a boding in the bass notes that startled her. And this was the other thing they shared, the sadness and clarity of time, time mourned in the music - how the sound shaped vibrations made by hammers striking wire strings made them feel an odd sorrow not for particular things but for time itself, the material feel of a year or an age, the textures of unmeasured time that were lost to them now, and she turned away, looking past her lifted hand into some transparent thing he thought he could call her life.}
