\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The God Eye burgeon weighed heavy in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pocket. It was there and it was always there. He could think of little else. More precisely, he could think of nothing but the God Eye sight. That burgeon had pulled back the world\u8217\'92s veil to reveal shimmering threads which actuated all instinct. And Elrahet could cut them. She\u8217\'92d cut Mandri right out of his own determined will. He wouldn\u8217\'92t normally mind being played with in such a way, so long as he had a choice. Waste away on a farm outside of Meskalim? That was his choice. This was too much. Elrahet had simply done what she wanted to do to  him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A new day progressed, and Mandri still could not think about anything else. The sight of that lifted veil and those shimmering threads gripped him. In time, he began to suspect that he could not pull away from thoughts because he was walking. Something about forward locomotion prevented lateral thinking. This explained why Outland pokes were stunted intellectually; too much walking, not enough time to stop and think. Even if they want to take pause, they couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t, because critical thought required a kind of recumbent ease which couldn\u8217\'92t be found in such a shadeless expanse. Even in the shade, there was the matter of the heat. Movement and heat\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 those together were the bane of reason. And so as it was, he actually had to stop walking to ask Moteah a question. She was trudging along just behind}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How long have you known her?\u8221\'94 he asked. The question left her confused, so he asked it again. \u8220\'93I said, how long have you known her?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you ask?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, trust is built over time. So, in a sense, I suppose I\u8217\'92m asking why you trust her.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh. You want to know what kind of witch she is?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri nodded, Moteah looked past his shoulder towards Elrahet, who was some distance ahead, trailing Ayram. She cupped her voice and called out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93El!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch stopped in her tracks and stared back. Her face was lost in the shadow of her cowl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri wants to know!\u8221\'94 Moteah called.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet drew an overhead arc in the air with her walking cane, then turned back towards Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s trail and continued the march.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That means she\u8217\'92ll tell you tonight,\u8221\'94 Moteah said, and she pushed Mandri along.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The much anticipated night came quickly. Mandri helped to build the fire, though his role was reduced to gathering fuel, as \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91maker of the fire\u8217\'92 was a role reserved for truer, more reliable men, like Moto. Not Mandri. Evidently, Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t be trusted to rub two sticks together. But when the fire was finished, Mandri was allowed to sit as close to the fire as he could. When everyone had gathered, Moteah gently reminded Elrahet of Mandri\u8217\'92s request.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ask again, and I won\u8217\'92t tell it,\u8221\'94 Elrahet warned. She sitting as close to the fire as Mandri, warming her bony knees. Moteah passed around a bag of jerked beef. Moto was gracious enough to share another skin of wine\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a generosity which led Mandri to wonder if this was a final meal. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The night settled in. The starry sky was bright. The air was pleasant, if cold. There was scuffle nearby as a grizzled desert rat met its end in the jaws of something that slithered. The rest hand wore on, and Mandri began to suspect that Elrahet had died with her eyes stuck open. Then she grumbled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where to begin?\u8221\'94. After another finger of contemplation, she said, \u8220\'93It is likely that the boy\u8217\'92s mind is too polluted to fathom it.\u8221\'94 Her eyes flicked to the stars. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in her eyes they were not stars but constellations. Gods long dead. Friends, too. Memories and }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Begin at the beginning,\u8221\'94 Ayram suggested.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How?\u8221\'94 she asked. \u8220\'93More might have come before the beginning. Solraheen was born into the Void, and so there He was. Solraheen inside the Black, and outside of it, the Allwhite. How did these three come to be? None can say. No, not even the Solitants.\u8221\'94 She looked at Mandri as she poisoned the name of that religious order.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri took a swig of the tasteless wine, and passed it on.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ====}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take or leave my story, boy, but first it must be given.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She means, shut up,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All I did was drink.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What did I just say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can drink and listen; she said Solraheen came from somewhere.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Everyone stared at him like he was an idiot. Everyone but Ayram. Ayram was half asleep.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright, I\u8217\'92ll be quiet.\u8221\'94 He poked the cork back in the wineskin to show that he was done interrupting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There was Solraheen, the Black, and the Infinite Allwhite,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said, recentering her story. \u8220\'93There were no days back then. There were no years to measure the passing of the ages. Solraheen spent this time alone. A hundred, thousand, million years alone. When He had enough of eternity, He uttered the first word, and behold, a Spark was pulled from the Infinite to join the Black.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She spat into the fire, sending a spout of sparks swirling into the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93From the Spark\u8217\'92s substance, He created a garden world. He fashioned land and sea for His enjoyment. He pulled up all manner of living creatures for His companionship. It was beautiful. Yet, beauty loses its charm when it stays the same, for Sameness was what He created. Order. Impotence. Each day indistinguishable from the day before. Thus, His garden did not give Him pleasure. Drab and dull, with dull rock and stolid bough reminding him of that which He\u8217\'92d meant to quit; it reminded Him of that eternity stuck inside the Black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In His boundless wisdom, He brought forth a new creation, wherein living creatures no longer merely lived\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they mated. They brought forth offspring. There were children, all of them different from each other and from their forebears. That was not all. He gave these living things brighter Sparks than they\u8217\'92d had before, such Sparks as we possess. In so doing, He condemned all living things to die, for the heat of their bright Sparks did slowly burn and kill them. For that is the purpose of death\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 death is the plow which turns the world over and gives seedlings room to grow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Consider that when you judge Solraheen for condemning all life to death. Know that death comes for the sake of a deeper, flowing purpose; purpose such as Solraheen Himself could not dream of. For as death destroys shadows, it lets new life grow tall, taller even, than can be dreamed. Solraheen Himself defined this truth. He believed that His work must be free from His own designs, that it might grow up to become itself, on its own terms. Any proud and loving parent would die that their children might live to reach beyond them, and lo, Solraheen did lay down to die, and die He did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He killed Himself?\u8221\'94 Mandri blurted out. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not how He died.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah smacked him on the back of his head. Wounded, he fished for sympathy from the rest of those gathered, but found none. He shrank back, and Elrahet continued on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen did lay down to die\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 BUT!\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 He did not fully die. Against His will, His body did awaken, possessed by a different mind. This mind was none other than the mind of His brother, Schisol.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This was a telling that went too far. There were acceptably familiar elements, yes, but the old woman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words were baited with blasphemy. Solraheen and Schisol were of the same flesh? }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Absurd.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Incredible.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She would be cursed if she went any further.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol awoke inhabiting Solraheen\u8217\'92s body, knowing nothing. He had no knowledge of the world, or of Solraheen who came before. He wandered His brother\u8217\'92s garden as confused as any of us. Yet as the ages passed His mind matured, and so did His heart. He felt the heat of the Sparked creatures and grew sorry for them. He saw how their every breath was an invisible flame, how their bodies were burning, slowly, until death. He bore their endless cycle of loneliness and pain, and He came to believe that creation was a corruption. He opened up their stomachs and learned that all of their Sparks had been pulled from the single infinite Allwhite, and from this revelation He devised a cure\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 loneliness and death would disappear if all Sparks were to be reunited together again in sacred communion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, Schisol set about destroying the garden, collecting stomachs as he went, joining their Sparks together. It took Him a long age, yet He prevailed. The last to join with the Allwhite was Himself. And so, He killed Himself, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body did wake again, this time, in the possession of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen awoke into the Black. He had no memory of what had occurred while Schisol was in control of Their body. He had no memory of Schisol. He knew only that He laid down to die amongst a beautiful world and had awoken into the emptiness. Confused, and seeing no other to blame for the disappearance of His garden world, He blamed Himself. His grief was immeasurable, though He began His work once more. This time He selected a number from amongst the living creatures and invested them with Mind, so that they could, in His absence, act as stewards of creation. These were the first humans, and they wandered the land, sailed the seas, fulfilling their duty admirably, living peaceably with each other. Solraheen was once again satisfied, and as before, He laid down to die so that His creation could come into its own. Instead of dying, you see, the ___, for His body rose again.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol awoke into His worst nightmare, for He saw that the Allwhite Spark had once again been shattered. Another miserable garden had blossomed, trapping all the Spark\u8217\'92s splinters into a never-ending cycle of death, suffering, and despair. Amongst the lonely creatures that roamed this garden were the saddest, loneliest, most temperamental creatures imaginable\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 humans. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol set out to destroy creation for a second time. To hasten this end, He explained to humanity their suffering, how it was caused by the splitting of the Spark, and He promised an end by enlisting their aid in dismantling creation. All would be made whole once more. Some humans were swayed. Others remembered the teachings of Solraheen and resisted. Schisol inflicted tortures upon them, but this pain only transformed them into beings of tremendous power\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the lesser gods. They arrayed themselves against Schisol and His minions. A cataclysmic battle took place. Almost all were killed. Schisol, too, was slain. But He was not completely dead. His body arose again, possessed, you can believe, by Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen awoke into a land laid waste by war. He asked the struggling humans what had happened, though He did not understand their stories, for the people claimed that He Himself had ordered the slaughter. They told of many men and women who did consecrate this dark command. They told of others who resisted. Solraheen listened, and from amongst those righteous people He chose a girl, whose compunctions He trusted, and He made her His Envoy that she might cleanse the garden of falseness. Solraheen fed her his flesh, that death might not find he. Together, they set out to regenerate the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol\u8217\'92s minions, still living, heard all this and believed that their god had betrayed them. Thus, from the Sparks of the dead they summoned the first Burshageet. This creature gave birth to the foulest of demons, a dark assassin with venom spun from shadows. It murdered Solraheen, even in the brightness of day. But He did not die, you can believe, for He arose again as Schisol.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen\u8217\'92s child ran to Him, thinking that she was running to her master. It was then that Schisol revealed Himself, for He did not recognize her, and thus, the truth of their dual nature was made plain. When Schisol learned that His own hands were responsible for creating death itself, this miserable world, His rage was boundless\u8230\'85What calmed Him was the hope that He could send a message to His brother and make Him see fit to end all this senseless suffering. But as Schisol did not trust Solraheen\u8217\'92s chosen child, He raised up another young woman for Himself and fed her from his body. She was His Shadow, and to her, He shared His message. Then, did he end Himself, that Solraheen might arise and learn the truth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol\u8217\'92s message was ill received by Solraheen. Schisol\u8217\'92s Shadow expected this. She had already rallied Schisol\u8217\'92s minions, and they murdered Solraheen. You can believe that all did not go well for them, for thereafter came a cycling which lasted another long eternity. When the Schisol lived, Solraheen\u8217\'92s blessed were martyred, and their purified Sparks transformed into gods who did join unto each other to unmake Schisol\u8217\'92s terror. When Solraheen lived, Schisol\u8217\'92s minions raised armies of demons to defy Him. In a desperate attempt to end this ceaseless struggle, Solraheen called down a piece of the Black, what you call Fabled Black, and it fell from the sky as a meteor to obliterate His body. He did this so as to prevent Schisol from ever rising again. And so we sit in this uncertain time. All to fight for. And ending near.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But the fight isn\u8217\'92t over,\u8221\'94 Moteah said, pointing out the obvious.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93The battle still rages, for Schisol\u8217\'92s Shadow still lives.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So does Sol\u8217\'92s blessed child,\u8221\'94 Moteah smirked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s instinct was to deny this fantastic story. His instincts were never wrong. However, he\u8217\'92d seen Elrahet in the light of The God Eye burgeon. If this witch was Sol\u8217\'92s child, immortal, ageless as the earth, well, that had some explanatory power. She would be the closest things to divinity walking the world. Her and the Burshageet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If it were true.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Too smart to believe it uncritically. She was the type to have this prepeared. Meaning in the . Manipulation. For all stories are a form of art, and all art is communication, and all communication is the of manipulation. }}
