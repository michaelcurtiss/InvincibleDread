\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The God Eye burgeon weighed heavy in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pocket. It was there and it was always there. He could think of little else. The God Eye sight had pulled back the veil to reveal a world of shimmering threads. It had shown how Elrahet could cut Mandri out of them. Mandri wouldn\u8217\'92t normally mind being left out of the world at large, but that should be his choice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Waste away on a farm outside of Meskalim? That was his choice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This was too much.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet had simply done what she wanted to do to  him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 As a new day progressed, Mandri began to suspect that his inability to think about anything else was due to the act of walking. Something about forward locomotion prevented lateral thinking. This explained why Outland pokes seemed stunted intellectually\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 too much walking, not enough time to think critically about things. He actually had to stop moving to ask Moteah a question.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She was trudging along just behind}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How long have you known her?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The question left her confused, so he asked again. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said, how long have you known her?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you ask?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well\u8230\'85trust is built over time. So, I suppose I\u8217\'92m asking why you trust her.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, you want to know what kind of witch she is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri nodded, Moteah looked past his shoulder towards Elrahet, who was some distance ahead, trailing Ayram. She cupped her voice and called out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93El!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The old witch turned in her tracks and stared back. Her face was lost in the shadow of her cowl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri wants to know!\u8221\'94 Moteah called.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet drew an arc in the air with her walking cane, then turned back towards Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s trail and continued the march.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That means she\u8217\'92ll tell you tonight,\u8221\'94 Moteah said, and she pushed Mandri along.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The much anticipated night\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rest came quickly. Mandri helped to build the fire, though his role was reduced to gathering fuel, as \u8216\'91maker of the fire\u8217\'92 was a role reserved for men, true men, like Moto. Not Mandri. Evidently, Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t be trusted to rub two sticks together. But when the fire was finished, Mandri was allowed to sit as close to the fire as he could. When everyone had gathered, Moteah gently reminded Elrahet of Mandri\u8217\'92s request.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ask again, and I won\u8217\'92t tell it,\u8221\'94 Elrahet warned as she warmed her bony knees by the fire. Moteah passed around a bag of jerked beef. Moto was gracious enough to share another skin of wine\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a generosity which led Mandri to wonder if this was a final meal. Then the night settled in.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The starry sky was bright. The air was pleasant, if cold. There was scuffle nearby as a grizzled desert rat met its end in the jaws of something that slithered. As the rest hand wore on, Mandri began to suspect that Elrahet had died with her eyes stuck open.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then she grumbled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where to begin?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 After another finger of contemplation, she started again. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is likely that the boy\u8217\'92s mind is too polluted to fathom it.\u8221\'94 She paused and her eyes flicked to the stars.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Begin at the beginning,\u8221\'94 Ayram suggested.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How? More might have come before the beginning. Solraheen was born into the Void, and so there He was. Solraheen inside the Black, and outside of it, the Allwhite. How did these three come to be? None can say. No, not even the Solitants.\u8221\'94 She looked at Mandri as she poisoned the name of that religious order.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri took a swig of the tasteless wine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take or leave my story, boy, but first it must be given.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She means, shut up,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All I did was drink.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What did I just say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m listening. Solraheen came from somewhere.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Everyone stared at him like he was an idiot. Everyone but Ayram. Ayram was half asleep.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sorry,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, and he poked the cork back in the wineskin to show that he was done interrupting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There was Solraheen, the Black, and the Infinite Allwhite,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said, re-centering her story. \u8220\'93There were no days back then. There were no years to measure the passing of the ages. Solraheen spent this time alone. A hundred, million, thousand years alone, and more\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 an eternity. When He\u8217\'92d had enough, He uttered the first word, and behold, the Spark was pulled from the Infinite to join him in the Black.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She spat into the fire, sending a gout of sparks swirling into the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93From the Spark\u8217\'92s substance, He created a garden world. He fashioned land and sea for His enjoyment. He created all manner of living creatures for His companionship. It was beautiful. Yet, beauty loses its charm when it stays the same. Sameness was what He created. Order. Each day was indistinguishable from the day before. Thus, His garden did not give Him pleasure. It was dull, and dullness reminded him of the very thing He\u8217\'92d meant to escape. It reminded Him of that timeless, changeless eon stuck inside the Black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In His boundless wisdom, He brought forth a new creation, one in which living creatures no longer merely lived. They brought forth offspring. There were many generations, all of them different from their forebears. He gave these living things brighter Sparks than they\u8217\'92d had before, such Sparks as we possess. In so doing, He condemned all living things to die, for the heat of their Sparks slowly burned and killed them. That is the purpose of death\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it is the plow which turns creation over and gives the seedlings room to grow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You might judge Solraheen for condemning us all to death, but know that death comes for the sake of a deeper, flowing beauty; beauty such as Solraheen Himself could not dream of. Death destroys shadows, lets life grow tall. Solraheen Himself defined this principle, for He truly believed that His creation must be free of His own influence, that it might grow up to define itself, on its own terms. Any proud and loving parent would die that their children might live to reach beyond them, and lo, Solraheen laid down to die, and die He did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He killed Himself?\u8221\'94 Mandri blurted out. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not how He died.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah smacked him on the back of his head, leading him to fish for sympathy from the rest of those gathered, but found none. So, he shrank back, and Elrahet continued on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen laid down to die\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 BUT!\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 He did not fully die. Against His will, His body reawakened, possessed by a different mind. This mind was none other than the mind of His brother, Schisol.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This was a telling that went too far. There were acceptably familiar elements, yes, but the old woman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words were baited with blasphemy. Solraheen and Schisol were of the same flesh?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Absurd.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Incredible.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She would be cursed if she went much further.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol awoke inhabiting Solraheen\u8217\'92s body knowing nothing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 He had no knowledge of the world or of Solraheen who came before. He wandered His brother\u8217\'92s garden as confused as any of us. As the ages passed, Schisol\u8217\'92s mind matured. He felt the heat of the Sparked creatures and grew sorry for them. He saw how their every breath was invisible flame, how their bodies were burning, slowly, until death. He saw their endless cycle of loneliness and pain, and He came to believe that creation was a corruption. He correctly supposed that all Sparks had been shattered from a single Allwhite Spark, and from this He devised a cure\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 loneliness and death would disappear if all Sparks were to be reunited together again in sacred communion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, Schisol set about destroying the garden, killing all the living creatures and joining their Sparks together. It took Him a long age, but He prevailed. The last thing to join with this Allwhite Spark was Himself. And so, He killed Himself, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, this time, in the possession of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen awoke into the Black accompanied by the Allwhite Spark. He had no memory of what had occurred while Schisol was in control of Their body. He had no memory of Schisol. He knew only that He laid down to die amongst a beautiful world and had awoken into the Black. Confused, and seeing no other to blame for the disappearance of His garden world, He blamed Himself. Though His grief was immeasurable, He began His creative work once more. This time He selected a number from amongst the living creatures and invested them with Mind, so that they could, in His absence, act as stewards of creation. These were the first humans, and they wandered the land, sailed the seas, filling their duty admirably, living peaceably with each other. Solraheen was once again satisfied, and as before, He laid down to die so that His creation could come into its own.  But instead of dying, His body rose again.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol awoke into His worst nightmare, for He saw that the Allwhite Spark had once again been shattered. Another miserable garden had blossomed, trapping all the Spark\u8217\'92s splinters into a never-ending cycle of loneliness, suffering, and despair. Amongst the lonely creatures that roamed this garden were the saddest, loneliest, most temperamental creatures imaginable\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 humans. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol set out to destroy creation for a second time. To hasten this end, He explained to humanity their suffering, how it was caused by the splitting of the Spark, and He promised an end by enlisting their aid in dismantling the rest of creation. All would be made whole once more. Some humans were swayed. Others remembered the teachings of Solraheen. They remembered creation\u8217\'92s beauty, and they resisted. Schisol inflicted tortures upon them, but this pain only transformed them into beings of tremendous power\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the lesser gods. They arrayed themselves against Schisol and His minions. A cataclysmic battle took place. Almost all were killed. Schisol, too, was slain. But He was not completely dead. His body arose again, possessed by Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen awoke into a land laid waste by war. He asked the struggling humans what had occurred, but He did not understand their stories. The people claimed that He Himself had ordered the slaughter. They told of how many men and women were eager to fulfill this dark command, though some resisted. From amongst these righteous people, Solraheen selected a girl, one whom He trusted, and He made her His Envoy that she might preach and cleanse the garden of falseness. Solraheen fed her his flesh, that death might not find her, that she might maintain His plan in His eventual absence. Together, they set out to regenerate the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol\u8217\'92s minions, those who survived, heard all this and believed that their god had betrayed them. Thus, from the Sparks of the dead they summoned the first Burshageet. This creature gave birth to the foulest of demons, a dark assassin with venom spun from shadows. It murdered Solraheen, even in the brightness of day. But He did not die, He arose again as Schisol.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen\u8217\'92s Envoy ran to Him, thinking that she was running to her master. Schisol revealed Himself, and thus, the truth of their dual nature was discovered. When Schisol learned that His own hands were responsible for creating this this suffering world, His rage was boundless\u8230\'85What calmed Him was the belief that, if He could send a message to His brother, He could make Him see fit to end all this senseless suffering. But as Schisol did not trust Solraheen\u8217\'92s Envoy to do the message justice, He raised up another young woman for Himself and fed her from his body. He called her his Shadow, and with her, He shared His foul message and ended Himself, that Solraheen might arise and learn the truth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol\u8217\'92s message was ill received by Solraheen. Thus, Schisol\u8217\'92s Shadow rallied Schisol\u8217\'92s minions, and they murdered Solraheen, and thereafter came a cycling which has lasted another long eternity. When the Schisol lives, Solraheen\u8217\'92s blessed are martyred, and their purified Sparks transform into gods who join together to undo Schisol\u8217\'92s terror. When Solraheen lives, Schisol\u8217\'92s minions raise armies of demons to undo Him. In a desperate attempt to end this ceaseless struggle, Solraheen called down a piece of the Black, what you know as Fabled Black, and it fell from the sky as a meteor and obliterated His body. He did this so as to prevent Schisol from ever rising again.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But the fight isn\u8217\'92t over,\u8221\'94 Moteah said, pointing out the obvious.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93The battle still rages, for Schisol\u8217\'92s Shadow still lives.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So does Sol\u8217\'92s Envoy,\u8221\'94 Moteah smirked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri knew better than to ask who it was. All eyes, including Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s, were fixed on Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s instinct was to deny this fantastic story. His instincts were never wrong. However, he\u8217\'92d seen Elrahet in the light of The God Eye burgeon. If this witch was a near immortal, as ageless as the earth, well, that had some explanatory power. She would be the closest things to divinity walking the world. Her and the Burshageet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 If it were true.}}
