It was dark. He lay quietly, lamenting his reinsertion into life\u8217\'92s causal flow. The God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon had been that good. He didn\u8217\'92t remember any of the trip, but he remembered that it was fantastic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He looked around. The room was empty of Ayramun. The tumble of burned-out twigs were there, and the Ayramun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s packs were still there, so he hadn\u8217\'92t been left behind. He decided to climb the ladder and see if anyone was lounging around outside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He climbed up the ladder\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rungs and was surprised to find that his great soreness was gone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That must have been the work of the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon, too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He decided to ask Seb about it as soon as he got the chance. That would be all he would ask, because he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to give her the impression that he couldn\u8217\'92t handle a single sliver of that beautiful burgeon. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He pulled himself up into that eerie black temple. He kept calling it a temple, but there was no altar or kneeling stone\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only that hole in the ground and the strange complex below. There was a scrawl of Old Jandri script circumscribing the inner dome, but Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t read it. He guessed it told of the life of some dead demon who\u8217\'92d died here and was buried in a crypt somewhere down below.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He stepped out into the cool evening air, happy to find that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d successfully slept through the day. With the heat of the sun disappearing in the west, he assumed they would be moving again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But no one was in a rush. They were all of them gathered at the top of the nearest sandy hill. They stood with backs turned, facing the setting sun, a remarkable set of outland pokes, all different sizes. Only Seb, at the end of the line, turned and regarded Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. This she did with a smirk and a wink. Mandri felt compelled to return the courtesy. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He scrambled up the hill to join her, and as soon as he arrived at the top of that dune hill, all schemes of feeling for Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeons fled from thought, for it was not the setting sun which stretched out above the distant horizon, but a heavy cloud as dark as the oncoming night. And it was more than a cloud, it was the Lord of clouds for it stretched out across the world and churned it over. It could have been mistaken for a rampaging herd of mountains, if such a thing were possible. Most incredible was its color, for its upper reaches pierced the shadow of the world's edge to catch the fleeing light of day\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 at the top, a rim-lit tip of gold, blurring into pink, oozing into red, while the cloud\u8217\'92s body was a dusty wall of reddish-black stretching all the way down to the desert floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Such magnificence was helped along by little westwind zephyrs tickling Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s skin. So far as he could tell, this behemoth of a storm was lumbering straight towards them. The sense of impending doom took his breath away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 For once Seb wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t chewing a spine\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it hung there on her lip, forgotten.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Big \u8216\'91ol bastard,\u8221\'94 she mumbled, and her spine dropped unheeded into the sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is unnatural,\u8221\'94 Mandri said in worried wonder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Course it\u8217\'92s natural,\u8221\'94 Seb said, remembering herself. \u8220\'93Never heard of an Ugmukheen? That storm there is the son of Mukh. Inherits His wrath.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto snorted then declared, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s no Ugmukheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whatchu know about it?\u8221\'94 Seb asked skeptically.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That storm is running east. Everyone knows Mukh sends the Ugmukheen north because He hates the cold up there and wants to kill it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everyone knows it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s because your you, Seb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everyone knows that Ugmukhs geet made when Mukh holds his breath above the Gongee sea. The high winds stop blowing, and it\u8217\'92s like taking the lid off a pot of steam. That\u8217\'92s what an Ugmukheen is. And the Gongee Sea is four days to the south, not to the west. And all that doesn\u8217\'92t mention how the Ugmukheen never look like }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 that}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 . And that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not to mention that Mukh has been dead three hundred years.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That so?\u8221\'94 said Seb, suspicious of Moto\u8217\'92s certainty. \u8220\'93How you know what the Ugmukhs look like if there ain\u8217\'92t been one for a three hundred year?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  know what they look like?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Cuz there it is!\u8221\'94 Seb shouted, pointing at the storm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quiet!\u8221\'94 grumbled Ayram, but even this could not quell Seb\u8217\'92s unruly mood. As everyone else humbled themselves before the sight of the storm, she was mumbling insults under her breath. She ended her childish tantrum by saying aloud, \u8220\'93I know an Ugmukh when I see one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet sneered at Seb. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You couldn\u8217\'92t pick your own shit from a bird\u8217\'92s.}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 That}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  is no Ugmukh. The Ugmukh is a mist of sand, not a wall. One can hardly see it coming. Your own dust pushes past your ankles and suddenly you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re caught.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb huffed disagreement, and that caused Elrahet to turn. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve survived an Ugmukheen, child. Not even Mukh Himself could have survived a thing as }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 that!}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 She jabbed her wooden stick towards the tempest and added, \u8220\'93}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 I}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  know what I see when I see it. I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve seen such storms before. I watched them flay the Slaveback mountains. They were not Ugmukheen. They were children of darker gods. It is not wrath which stoked them, it was evil.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Brooding Elrahet pulled her shawl tight. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All the gods who could bring such a storm upon the world are long dead. As long dead as Mukh.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This could be good news,\u8221\'94 Moteah said half-heartedly. \u8220\'93The Hrks can\u8217\'92t catch if is that storm is on our heels.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s scowl deepened. \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no outrunning it. We must stay here. Here is our only shelter. We stay and we pray to all that is holy that these hills don\u8217\'92t swallow us afore the Amalgamete gets its chance.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s got to be another way,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93We need to move.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Could try south,\u8221\'94 Seb offered. \u8220\'93Down to the Kari plain. Get out of its way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Won\u8217\'92t have time. We stay here until it passes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But what about the Hrks?\u8221\'94 Moto cautioned. \u8220\'93If we don\u8217\'92t keep moving, they\u8217\'92ll catch us long before we ever catch sight of Bullr.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Could try straight for the Goree,\u8221\'94 Seb suggested.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t hear it,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled as his fingers tightened on his spear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But it\u8217\'92s the only way,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93South or straight east to the Goree, all I know is we\u8217\'92ve got to move.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram leaned motionless on his certainty as both Seb and Moto worked hard to plant a seed of doubt. It seemed Ayram believed, according to his ornery glare, that nothing but a white light descending from on high could change his mind. He had no intention of listening to what anyone had to say. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even listen to himself. First he claimed that their only worry was the sandstorm bearing down on them, and when Moto found a clever way to spin that into an argument for fleeing, Ayram asserted that it was best if they got caught up in the storm because it would put off the Hrkan pursuit for a time. There were other, subtler contradictions in his reasoning, but no one pointed any of them out because there was a clear and consistent message here\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram was going to do what Ayram wanted to do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri wondered why a man so big ever bothered talking. He could simply act and everyone else would have to follow along. When the argument turned into a lecture it became clear that Ayram, like any great leader, had an instinctual hatred for the fact that other people wanted to do different things than he did. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t enough for everyone to follow, they had to be in agreement. And like any great politician his words were flexibly inflexible\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they might bend back on themselves but underneath was a will of solid granite. He was as willfull as a Hrkan Lord, only, less refined. A brute. The Lords and their Men of the Quorum would inflict their laws upon the world and they felt justified in doing so because the gods were dead. Ayram\u8217\'92s justification was that he was biggest, and that would have been true if regardless of whether or not Sol\u8217\'92s Spark rode upon the morning.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 By the end of his lecture he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d calmed himself down enough to formulate the bones of a reasonable plan.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re staying put,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93After the storm passes, we\u8217\'92ll have two options. If the storm pulls south or heads straight east, we sprint like a dinner bell and head straight for Bullr and hope the Hrks. If luck is on our side, and the storm pulls north, then we make straight for the Goree Pass. With the Storm delaying the Hrks in the north, we\u8217\'92ll have plenty of time. Once in the pass, the Greskalun will keep the Hrks off our tail for a time. Greskal hates Hrk as much as anyone.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram eyed each of his people one by one to make sure he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d won their assent. With that in hand, he turned and side-step shuffled back down the hill. Moto stamped after him, hoping to secure for himself normal rations against this change of plans which would extend their journey. Of the rest of the Ayramun, Moteah seemed the most unaffected. She was crouching atop a black rock, arm binding her knees, chin tucked in her elbow, drawing little abstract faces in the sand with a stick. She\u8217\'92d draw them, then watch the wind brush them away grain by grain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb was watching the storm looking mightily pleased.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well,\u8221\'94 Mandri said suggestively, \u8220\'93We suddenly find ourselves in possession of a day or two of recreation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb patted her pocket, and to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s delight, she nodded and wandered back down the hill.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t follow too quickly as he\u8217\'92d arouse too much suspicion. Motoeah would probably ask why he wanted to waste the day with Seb. So, he counted to ten. Then he decided he\u8217\'92d better count to one hundred. When he got impatient with that, he said, \u8220\'93Well, I\u8217\'92ll, uh\u8230\'85I\u8217\'92ll go settle in.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He scrambled down the hill to find Seb and burgeons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Unfortunately, Moto found him first. The man was climbing up the temple ladder just as Mandri was about to climb down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are you going?\u8221\'94 Moto asked as he climbed up onto the temple tile.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To settle in.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No free food until you show me you can earn your keep.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In his hand was a Hrkan short sword stuck in a tawny scabbard that had been salvaged from the battle of Minting Rock. Moto extended this out towards Mandri, hilt first, clearly expecting Mandri to take it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t imagine what you\u8217\'92d want me to do with this,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto was not amused. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you remember our conversation? Near the drag-belly den?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nope,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, biting his tongue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93I was teaching you what men are made for. You don\u8217\'92t remember?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I recall correctly, I had more pressing concerns at the time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re made for solving problems.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah, right. You said that, and then you threw me into jaws of a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head tilted as if to interrogate Mandri\u8217\'92s Spark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was going easy on you then,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Now I\u8217\'92m going to be difficult. Take the damned sword.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri hesitated, but the man was serious, so he grabbed the sword and followed Moto back outside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The burgeons would have to wait.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah was there, heading for the temple interior. She paused when Mandri came stumbling out. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you two doing?\u8221\'94 she asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to walk the Sand with a useless boy,\u8221\'94 Moto declared. \u8220\'93Useless is unacceptable.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you\u8217\'92ve something to say to me, then say it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This has nothing to do with your own failure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah grunted, then posted herself against the temple door to watch, clearly unconvinced that this wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t some elaborate attempt to anger her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A fight is a crucible,\u8221\'94 Moto said grandly, centering his attention on Mandri. \u8220\'93In a fight you will find things inside others which you did not know were there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m pretty sure I already know what a person\u8217\'92s insides look like. I don\u8217\'92t need to cut them open.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I speak of bravery,\u8221\'94 Moto sneered. \u8220\'93Bravery, cowardice, and many other things which no poet has yet made the words for.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I\u8217\'92ve always heard that there is no such thing as bravery or cowardice.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is what the Hrks would have you believe. What is it they say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah chimed in, saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They say, \u8216\'91Bravery and cowardice are both symptoms of unpreparedness.\u8217\'92\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s it!\u8221\'94 Moto said, face alight, as if he\u8217\'92d just stumbled into a nostalgic dream. He then adopted the airs of schoolteacher lecturing students on the Hrkan ways of life. \u8220\'93In war there is only preparedness, and unpreparedness. If a soldier is ever called on to be brave, then his commander has failed him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of all the shadows from Shis,\u8221\'94 Moteah muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto continued on, sternly, as if reciting sacred scripture, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Either the fighting man is fully prepared for what he faces and is victorious, or his commander has failed. If a commander\u8217\'92s soldiers face unbalanced odds, then the commander has failed in his maneuvers. This is a symptom of unpreparedness. Such a commander should kill himself.\u8221\'94 He lowered his aloof airs and added, \u8220\'93These are not my words, they are Lord Kashkan\u8217\'92s.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He then strode several paces away and drew his gold-hilted sword with a flourish. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The truth is that you can be as prepared as you can possibly be for a fight, but still face bad odds.\u8221\'94 He flicked the air with his blade. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what calls for bravery.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He then swish-flicked his sword through the air in front of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly, as if slicing through Lord Kashkan\u8217\'92s guidance. \u8220\'93Lesson number one. Don\u8217\'92t ever listen to a Hrk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I already don\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 Mandri replied.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lesson number two\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the line between bravery and foolishness is a thin one. Always run away from a fight if you can.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri promptly dropped his sword in the dirt. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s a prodigy,\u8221\'94 Moteah said, chuckling. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Very cute,\u8221\'94 said Moto, eyes narrowing in irritation.  \u8220\'93Pick up your sword.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, \u8220\'93Isn\u8217\'92t the whole point of a Mazid to make swordplay obsolete? I mean, shouldn\u8217\'92t you be focusing on toughening up your sister instead of me? She\u8217\'92s the Minder. I\u8217\'92m just a tool.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto switched his sword to his left hand and showed off his off-hand skill with another dexterous swish-flick and slice. The man was quite adept at slaying air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tools need to be balanced and sharp,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I suspect my sister\u8217\'92s difficulties stem from the fact that you are a gutless lump of fluff. If you were sharp, strong, like the other Mazidai I\u8217\'92ve seen, she\u8217\'92d get a better handle of you. So pick up your sword.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Mandri hesitated, Moto looked to his sister and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Make him pick up the sword.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright,\u8221\'94 Mandri said before Moteah could get involved. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll play. But only to absorb a lesson. Don\u8217\'92t expect me to swing this thing with any kind of confidence.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He picked up the sword. Its heft felt awkward in his hand. Its blade was dark like Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spear, though its single-edge was bright as silver, two-hands long, and it was thick, heavy, almost more like a cleaver than a sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now,\u8221\'94 said Moto, crouching into an explosive stance, sword held before him. \u8220\'93If you\u8217\'92re in a fight, what are you trying to do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Survive?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Be more specific.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Run away.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In the event where you }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 must }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 fight, what should you do?}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1  }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Be specific.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How can I be specific when I don\u8217\'92t know who or what I\u8217\'92m fighting?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eager shoulders grew more sullen with each exchange. He sighed and said, \u8220\'93You are fighting me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, then I\u8217\'92ll stab you before you stab me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Be more specific.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll stab you in the uglies.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ll probably miss,\u8221\'94 Moteah said, snickering.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto ignored her and said to Mandri, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You said you were a painter, yes? When you paint a picture, what is the first thing you are trying to do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t see how that has anything to do with killing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did I speak of killing?\u8221\'94 Moto asked derisively. \u8220\'93A fight is as artful as anything else. All artists try to get at the human heart, a man with a sword simply takes the most direct approach. The only difference between a warrior and a poet is that the best poet is a matter of opinion, but the strongest warrior\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that is a matter of fact.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And who is the best? You?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I might be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who would win in a fight, you or Ayram?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The answer was obvious, but Moto didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t answer quickly. He snorted disbelief, then rubbed his head in frustration, as if the question was one of those utterances that made semantic sense but signified nothing, a stumbling block for would-be philosophers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That question depends on too many things,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That question lacks context,\u8221\'94 Moteah said, playing on her brother\u8217\'92s insecurities by supporting him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93It isn\u8217\'92t a real question.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The context is you versus Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face went through such an extended series of contortions that he could have charged money to see the act. Somewhere in there was the suggestion that it was offensive to even ask the question. He went through a few different shades of disappointment as well, and it was obvious he was upset with himself for letting things stray too far from the lesson at hand. He was also upset at Mandri for simply existing. In the end, his face settled into plain old resentment, and he blurted out, \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re done. If you don\u8217\'92t want help, you won\u8217\'92t get it. Stay weak. You\u8217\'92ll die and we\u8217\'92ll find another Minder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto stomped past and fled into the temple. Before his head disappeared down the ladder, he paused and said bitterly, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep the sword.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When he was gone, Mandri shared an impish smile with Obo. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should probably head down as well, don\u8217\'92t you think?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at the sky behind you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri looked behind and saw the brilliant reds and purples of the approaching storm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, right. Almost forgot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri sheathed his sword and tucked it into the waist of his robe. He then hauled Obo, still in his litter, into the tiny temple and down the ladder. Once down, he propped Obo up against the wall and wandered off to find Seb, but the idiot had gone to sleep. Instead of enjoying a mind-splitting burgeon, Mandri sat against the wall and waited in boredom with the rest of the Ayramun. It did not take long for the storm to break over them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 First came the shadow as the storm blocked out the setting sun, leaving the air outside suffused with a dim orange glow. Then came the soothing sound of wind-whipped sand splashing against the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bricks above. Every now and then a gust of wind would blow into the temple entrance and swirl around inside, and if the wind was strong enough, it blew through the hole in the floor, turning the ladder room and the tunnel beyond into a sort of flute\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the faint whimpering whine sounded startlingly similar to the birthing fits of the brown mutts back in Meskalim.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 As the wind intensified, this whine steadied into a droll hum, a sound so annoying that all the Ayramun retreated deeper into the tunnel behind the ladder. Only Mandrameen and Obo stayed in the ladder room. Obo was there because no one could be bothered to pick him up and move him. Mandri stayed because he was mesmerized by the sight and sound of the storm outside. Being near to a monstrous, blossoming power was intoxicating.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wonder what caused it?\u8221\'94 Mandri wondered as the blackness settled in. The room had no fire, and that was fine, because the energy from the storm outside was somehow a comfort. It made Mandri feel squeezed in, bottled up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think it was sent by the Amalgamete? Does it have this kind of power?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I cannot say,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe it was Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen didn\u8217\'92t make this storm. As I\u8217\'92m sure you are aware, He no longer exists amongst the living.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He might not have made this particular storm, but He made\u8230\'85you know\u8230\'85He made the structure for it. He made the world that made it. Maybe He even made the Amalgamete.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How profound,\u8221\'94 Obo said sarcastically.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It must be Solraheen, even if it wasn\u8217\'92t Him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you hear yourself when you speak? Mandri, you make no sense.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What I mean is, whatever caused it, there\u8217\'92s a chain that goes back to Solraheen, because He\u8217\'92s the only true creator. Everyone else can only move things around, but that\u8217\'92s not true creation. Solraheen created everything, set it in motion, so it all goes back to Him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Even the Amalgamete?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Even the Amalgamete.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was feeling philosophical. All that was missing was some burgeon beer to complete the cozy mood. A nice freeweed wrap would do as well, but he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t usually go in for those. The heat of the storm worked a warmness into his skin, and the dimness, coupled with the storm\u8217\'92s humbling immensity, was working wonders on his stress. Satisfying, too, was the knowledge that he didn\u8217\'92t have to do damned thing, at least not for a good long while.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He asked Obo, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you have any beliefs? Does a Mazid believe anything?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Forget I asked. I\u8217\'92m just happy you\u8217\'92re here with me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m touched,\u8221\'94 said Obo. Obo\u8217\'92s pale face was the only thing Mandri could really see in this darkness. As the rest of Obo\u8217\'92s body was swaddled in black, his face hovered like a ghost above the ground. He looked delighted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m happy too,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Without you I\u8217\'92d be alone amongst these Ayramun, and that would be horrific.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you given any more thought to our escape?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve given up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where would I go? Back to Hrk? Never. These people, rough as they are, they\u8217\'92re my only chance at freedom. It\u8217\'92s a slim chance that Elrahet gives me a Spark, but she\u8217\'92s the only person in all the world who could.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The two of them sat in contemplative silence for half a hand. Mandri mulled over Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s miserable life. Obo was a creature created to be a slave, a weapon. All he\u8217\'92d known was cruelty and killing. It was a rough deal, like a dog born and bred for the pit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri felt a swell of goodwill rise up in himself. He wondered if this was some lingering effect of the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon. If it was, it didn\u8217\'92t matter, because it was there and there was no ignoring it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know what, Obo? You deserve a Spark more than I do. I\u8217\'92d give you mine if I could.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thank you for saying that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, I mean it. Maybe I can get you a Spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If Moteah\u8217\'92s right, then they }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 need}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  your Mazidfire. If you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve got no Minder, then they\u8217\'92ve got no other way to kill the Amalgamete, other than to give you a Spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo smiled politely. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t worry about me. I don\u8217\'92t think that\u8217\'92s a productive use of your time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, what else am I going to do? Worry about me? My fate is sealed. You said yourself that I don\u8217\'92t have the right stuff to be a Minder. And you\u8217\'92re right, I\u8217\'92m never going to force you to do something you don\u8217\'92t want to do. I\u8217\'92m not a slaver. They\u8217\'92re going to kill me as soon as they figure that out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If someone }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 must}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  be my Minder, I would prefer it would be you.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What I truly don\u8217\'92t understand is why they chose me for the job.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is strange, isn\u8217\'92t it? If you }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 could}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  summon my Mazidfire, that would make you more powerful than them. You could do whatever you wanted to them.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why would they trust me with the power to control you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All threads draw back to a black tattered robe.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Indeed. The mystery of you is circumscribed by the mystery of Elrahet. I watched her as we walked\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she is no ordinary witch, too strong for her age. In all matters of Mazid and Minder, Ayram defers to her.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know, she\u8217\'92s not the only witch I\u8217\'92ve seen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She isn\u8217\'92t?\u8221\'94 Obo asked. His silver eyes widened in curiosity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri leaned towards Obo, and he lowered his voice so that it would not carry. The whipping wind outside did well to hide his whispered words.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Before I was killed, I was visited by a witch just like Elrahet, only taller. And you know that golden knife Elrahet has?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, that witch had one just like it. Exactly the same. They could be sisters. Except this witch wanted me to serve the Amalgamete, not kill it. And there was no question about her being evil. She ripped out my ox\u8217\'92s stomach, then swallowed its Spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes turned to the floor as he worked to fit this new information into a picture which made sense. Mandri was content to let Obo do the puzzling for them both. Eventually, Obo\u8217\'92s floating head broke into a big, stupid smile.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is it?\u8221\'94 Mandri whispered with excitement.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is this what friendship feels like?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri drew back and soured. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t say something like that out loud. You just feel it. Dwell in it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry, I haven\u8217\'92t done this before.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can tell.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s somehow intoxicating.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Stop talking about it. When you talk about it, you make it boring.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not boring to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look, when people start talking about their emotions and stuff, I have this physical reaction to it, and it\u8217\'92s annoying, so stop.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What kind of physical reaction?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My legs get hot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your legs get hot?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what I said. Now shut up about it and figure out what is going on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stood up and fashioned some pillows out of what packs had been left in the room. He gave a quick look for Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack, because a drop of God\u8217\'92s Eye would significantly improve the moment, but Seb had expected this and had taken her pack with her. Mandri was forced, against his will, to lay there sober and watch the hole in the ceiling as the storm\u8217\'92s rage continued to build.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Hand after hand passed like this, and all the while the winds outside were rising. His thoughts turned to children\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stories, the ones that warned about the Ugmukheen. These stories came with instructions\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hide the women, for as it passes it may fill their wombs. Beware the cough that can kill as vast quantities of sand are unavoidably inhaled. Store water, for it will strip the air of moisture, and its heat will sear the lungs. Mandri felt all these things coming on, except of course, the pregnancy part. But one thing he hadn\u8217\'92t seen was the snap and crackle of lightning leaping from every surface. The stories were clear on that\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the air should come alive with little lightnings. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The heat soon increased until the air was as hot as an oven. Mandri moved to flap his arms to air out his sweaty pits, and the motion conjured up a shocking spark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He yelped in surprise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your hair looks ridiculous,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri reached up in the dark, and half the hairs on his head were standing on end. His excitement at this electric thrill was tempered by the sound of rock sliding atop rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was coming from the temple above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The wind is lifting the dome,\u8221\'94 said Obo, with a hint of worry.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Should we be in here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would say that we should be fine, but, you never know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri repositioned his makeshift cot as far away from the hole as the room allowed, shocking himself several times in the process. Before he was finished, an especially loud howl of wind kicked a gout of sizzling sand into the temple above, and it was followed by a splitting shock of thunder.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 CRACKABOOOM}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All Mandri saw was a flash of white light and then, suddenly, blackness, for the temple above caved in on itself, and the circle in the ceiling disappeared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri  shuffled back and felt for the wall. He could hear a torrent of sand pouring down into the room, and soon he felt it licking at his toes. The fear of being buried alive stunned him, but the flood of sand stopped as the hole above was plugged by a glut of the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bricks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well...that\u8217\'92s not good,\u8221\'94 he said as one last wisp of sand drifted down\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the sad, dying breath of another Old Jandri relic. }}
