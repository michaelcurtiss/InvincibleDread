You been getting uppity these days, and it\u8217\'92s time to stop.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb scoffed at this sudden turn. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t backtalk,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I give suggestions.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When Ayram was confident that Seb had absorbed enough of his ire to fall in line, he turned again to Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You understand?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Say it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I understand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Good\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but for now you\u8217\'92ll be following Moto.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto perked up. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Me? Where are you going?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m going to scout for the Hrks,\u8221\'94 said Ayram. Then he added, smiling, \u8220\'93and if I happen to smash a demon\u8217\'92s skull on the way, then the world is better for it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where you want to meet up?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Greskalun or no Greskalun, we\u8217\'92re going to Shulgi. If the Mazyd was right, it will be empty. We\u8217\'92ll meet up there, in the highest columned room. If you\u8217\'92re not there, don\u8217\'92t worry\u8230\'85I\u8217\'92ll find you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 With that, he grabbed his iron spear and leapt up the western slope, jumping from rock to rock with a dexterous, grace that defied his giant frame.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His leaving left an uneasy silence which stayed unbroken until Elrahet growled in disappointment. Without Ayram to carry her, she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have to walk.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She climbed out of the pack and stretched her legs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whose going to carry these two?\u8221\'94 She asked, kicking the bag of bodies.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto, standing a little straighter now that he was in charge, said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think it\u8217\'92s time Mandri pulled his own weight.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto reached down into Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack and pulled out Obo\u8217\'92s pale and lifeless corpse by the neck. Then he grabbed Mandri\u8217\'92s litter and stuffed Obo into it as best he could.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll carry Obo,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, \u8220\'93but I\u8217\'92m telling you, I }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 cannot}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  carry both of them. My back is already near breaking.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}}
