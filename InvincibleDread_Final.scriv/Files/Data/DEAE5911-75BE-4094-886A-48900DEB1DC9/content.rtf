He was denied each time, and each time Seb grew angrier.. He got so mad that he threatened to kill Mandri, and when that didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t work, he threatened to kill the burgeons. Mandri didn\u8217\'92t believe him, but that night Seb pulled out one of those beautiful eyes and he threw it into the dark as far as he could.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That night Mandri tried to steal Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burgeons as the man slept. The only problem with his plan was that Seb wasn\u8217\'92t actually sleeping. Mandri ended up with Seb\u8217\'92s knife on his throat, and Seb pushed so hard that Mandri choked. The blade must have been blunt. After this incident, Mandri did not try to steal the burgeons again.}}
