Mandri suspected they\u8217\'92d refined some secret oil bath which held the cloth strong against the smear of sand and sweat. The men themselves, however, were not as robust; they unraveled as soon as they stepped through the tower\u8217\'92s tunnel and saw the courtyard skewered with pilgrim poles. Half cried out at the smell, a few vomited, the rest became enraged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle was the only level head amongst them. He barked orders with clean diction, orders assiduously planned for such an event. He reorganized his men into their squares, formed a squad of the literate to anatomize the scene, dispatched messengers to the nearest outpost, and sent scouts scrambling up gulches to seek the well which fed the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tower. He had them look for foraging opportunities as well, for a continued journey, as well as a return journey. Moto muttered something about how there wouldn\u8217\'92t be a return journey, implying death, and Pyetle laughed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We are no pilgrims,\u8221\'94 he said with a grin. \u8220\'93We can manage whatever dwells in these mountains.\u8221\'94 And with that same presumptive smile he ordered Ayram to move on ahead and give tongue the moment he caught sign of their quarry. Ayram assented, and on they went.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a winding canyon. Once around the fist bend, Ayram ran up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree. He stood up on a cropped boulder and glared back down, expecting everyone else to follow. A few did, among them Elrahet. She clambered up, escorted by a few Vessels, and when she finally made it up to Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s perch, Pyetle ordered everyone else to stop.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Everyone stopped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle ducked into a huddle of his commanders and began to scheme.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri baked on the canyon floor. There wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t much moisture in him, but the dry air was still eager for it. He languished there, sitting amidst a crowd of curious and bitter Vessels. Whispered rumor of marching orders eventually made it back. The word was that Moteah and the horse were going to be kept behind in the tower, with a small bevy of men to watch them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  The Vessels all thought it was a sensible idea. They reasoned that it was better to dismantle the certain threat which was Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Mazidfire instead of preserving it to deal with a rumored threat; a rumor which, by the way, had been conjured by a witch so as to scare off the hand of justice. Most doubted there were any demons larger than a dog left in all the world. Few, if any, believed in such a thing as a king of demons who could not be harmed by their own pulsing pecs. None, it seemed, were able to imagine themselves being lashed to a pole, body ravaged, even though the pilgrim poles could still be seen if they\u8217\'92d simply peer around the bend behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Their lack of fear made Mandri afraid.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 How could they doubt Elrahet?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There were always good reasons to doubt a witch, but it shouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have been possible to remember those reasons when there she was, standing high up on her perch like a crow, back bent with a peevish beak, herald of a day of death with the sun was already high and behind her. She was the very essence of doom. See how her stooped figure cast a gnarled spike of shadow down the length of the slope, a shadow thorned by the contours of jumbled rock, sticking here and there into the manicured robes of men who\u8217\'92d paused their climb on Pyetle\u8217\'92s order.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 How could all these Hrkan men could ignore her obvious threat? They busied themselves, instead, with killing time. One tall fellow with a tilted chin and rebellious teeth was taking bets on who of the Ayramun would be executed first. Others tended to their aching feet. A circle of hungry smiles were dreaming out loud, in a competitive sort of way, about women. Perhaps if Elrahet had been a few thousand years younger, and pert, they might have paid attention to her mood. And then, of course, when Elrahet grumbled something unintelligible, and her grumbling rolled down the rocky slope like warning stones before a landslide, they had the gall to act surprised. Even Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s huddle paused their scheming to wonder if they\u8217\'92d just been cursed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A Vessel nearest Mandri, a hard men with a hairy neck, shouted back up at the witch, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shove it back down your throat!\u8221\'94 It was a crude counter curse, but a few chuckles encouraged him, followed by a hearty laugh. Another brave Spark shouted up, \u8220\'93Missed your nap, old mam?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s frown deepened. \u8220\'93If you value your lives,\u8221\'94 she said, voice spreading up and down the canyon, \u8220\'93you will bring the girl along!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A few Vessels tried to pull her from her perch, but she poked them away with her cane and revisited her ire upon the gawking crowd. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Only Mazidfire can defeat what awaits us. Without the girl to mete the flame, you will all be dead!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Hrks fell into fit of laughter. The obviousness of her act was too much for them. When their derision turned to calls for her head, Pyetle stood up on a rock and quieted them all with a serious frown.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He said, grandly, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Diligence demands that we search for her rumored beast.\u8221\'94 He paused to dare anyone to challenge him. \u8220\'93However,\u8221\'94 he continued, \u8220\'93I would be a poor mirror for the Lordship if I were to trust a witch blindly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He turned to address Elrahet directly. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry, but the girl will stay behind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ability to project certainty was impressive. In truth, he was as damned by ignorance as all these who followed him. There he was, tugging his beard like the situation was well under control. It was enough, at least, for his men to see those three rings on his pinching fingers, thin silver bands which marked three years each in logic, rhetoric, and calculation. Yes, those scribal fingers swelled with intellect as they pulled insight out at the root. How could such a man, with such education, misjudge anything?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Unleashing your Mazid,\u8221\'94 Pyetle proclaimed, \u8220\'93would defeat the whole purpose of our being here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet did not reply. She simply stood there and matched Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stubbornness with her own. When Pyetle dismissed her scowl with a smirk, she snarled. \u8220\'93Come then!\u8221\'94 she yelled. \u8220\'93Do leave the girl behind. Her hands will tender your carcass to the knackers.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She lowered her guard, and the Vessels behind her seized her shoulders and waist. Pyetle, still smirking, gave his men a perfunctory nod, then hopped down off his rock and returned to his schemes as the sound of hooves carried Moteah away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Each clip-clop prickled Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He watched Moteah bounce in the saddle. He turned away, lest her fear begin to bleed into him more than it already was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He could sense an ending in these mountains.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Outside himself, the mood, overall, was eager. The Vessels were a little anxious. Some of them were sizing Ayram up, debating amongst themselves who could take him. Then Pyetle broke his conference and ordered everyone to climb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri clambered up the slope with relative ease. He pulled himself up to that shelf of rock where everyone gathered. There, one of the Vessels, a swarthy fellow with a pouncing glare, spat on his shoes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the last bit of water you\u8217\'92ll take from me!\u8221\'94 the man declared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Other Vessels joined in with insults of their own. Evidently they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been driven hard for days without stopping to find a well, and for whatever reason, they blamed Mandri. One man even patted Mandri\u8217\'92s robes, looking for a waterskin to steal. Of course, he found none.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re movin\u8217\'92 off!\u8221\'94 one Vessel shouted, and the march began anew. Mandri moved somewhere in the middle of it, sandwiched between two loaves of angry men. On they went, traveling along a sinuous walk of rock which lined the road below. A short stair led to a bend which bent up and back around, and as it did it narrowed to the width of a hand. The way then dipped into a tall fissure which split the towering bulk of the plateau in two. This opening was hardly wider than Mandri\u8217\'92s shoulders, yet every Vessel in front barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri squeezed into this spindly chasm, where stacked layers of red and redder rock were bent by the ages into dramatic, sweeping forms. Both sides bracketed a thin, winding strip of blue sky above. Such was the height and swerve of the walls that direct sunlight could not touch the mush of sand and fallen rock that was the floor. And so it was difficult to keep up with the speed of the march. And they marched for good long while, such that the sun had time to hop over the streamlet of sky above, long enough for Mandri to remember that he was tramping through a curse\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s repercussion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 After a hand or two, or perhaps three, the way belled out; a length of the chasm on either side had collapsed to open up a valley. The slopes bulged with piles of stone. To the left, towering above the rubble, was the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision. Above that plateau was the blazing, latter-day sun. Below, sheltering in the shadows of the larger stones, were stands of white Vessels. Seb was among them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Almost there,\u8221\'94 she said upon seeing Mandri\u8217\'92s pained expression.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Almost where?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Before Seb could answer, a pox-scarred soldier got between them and pushed Seb onwards.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Hrkan march stretched out into a trickle. Daylight dimmed, and the way turned again into a scramble which led steeply upwards. When Mandri finally lifted his eyes from the ankle-twisting rocks, he found himself standing on top of a grand plateau. The brisk evening air swirled atop this flat, untucking the robes of the now disorganized Hrkan advance; gone was any sense of marching orders as pods of threes to fives trailed behind ones and twos, all of them scurrying towards a distant, dizzying staircase that led up to a higher plateau. Halfway through a tired groan, Mandri realized that those stairs, that climb, that monumental stump of rock, it was all a building.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It looked like a massive clay saucepot set upside down. And it was smooth, and etched everywhere with lines defining densely packed designs, as diamonds, squares, and circles were everywhere joined together to make abstract faces; animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gape. The nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the skull of a mouse. The whole monumental canvas was filled with faces, save for strips on the top and bottom, such that this parade of creation wrapped all the way around the pottish structure like a belt.}
\par\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had trouble thinking through his astonishment. Set here in the mountains, the middle of nowhere, this building was something special. The trail of hrkwhite specks climbing the tower of steps invested him with a sense of scale\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 monstrous.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a wonder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d never seen its like.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All the man-made wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this building should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of Outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered vitalize the glory of the conqueror. This rockpot would have been a bright jewel in a Lordly crown, and that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not even accounting for the effects of the setting sun\u8217\'92s rays painting the stone with flame. The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Lords did not know of it. If they had, the building would have been reduced to a painting a long, long time ago.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The structure appeared to be abandoned. If it were a living temple, there would be fire light and movement. The breeze would be smearing incense smoke out into the west, and dour voices would be chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter brushed with the scent of a snake. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s aches and wearies left him. He hustled along with the Vessels, and when he reached the base of the entrance stair he cut in line.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There were at least three-hundred steps, and they were each steep and uneven, like layers of melted wax. A dark stain was climbing up them. Mandri guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t oil, well, it could be any number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a temple that large had to drain out somewhere. Odd that they\u8217\'92d have it running out the front door. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But he knew it was blood. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Because of course it was blood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t any people where people were expected to be.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 As well, they were hunting a demon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Blood explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under his skin. It explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. And that wasn\u8217\'92t the end of it, for the many faces etched into the wonder\u8217\'92s wall collapsed into a chaotic swirl of lines just above a curved entrance arch, as if being sucked into the interior, or spewed out of it, and all of them were stained in their grooves by that same dark substance which dripped down the stairs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Yes, that temple entrance was a blood-stained maw.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Perhaps the demon they were seeking was the building itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Perhaps it had eaten the Greskalun. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 More explanatory power.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Form up!\u8221\'94 Pyetle barked, his voice a little slimmer in this thinner mountain air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A Vessel grabbed Mandri by the neck and arranged him alongside the assembling Hrkan squares. When they were all formed up atop that table of rock, Pyetle began a formal review. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His appraising eye ticked from face to face. Mandri expected to see a pride meant to instill bravery, but no, there was anger in Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mood, and panic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is he!?\u8221\'94 Pyetle shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri risked a sheepish glance around to try and puzzle out what Pyetle was referring to.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is the giant!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri searched for Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s towering frame. The giant should have been standing out like a black mast in this sea of white robes. He was missing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A Vessel in the first square wavered for a moment, then stepped forward. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was Dar and Fally,\u8221\'94 he said, anxiety rippling his words. \u8220\'93They were watching the Giant. They, uh\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re not here!\u8221\'94 Pyetle roared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They were with the giant! I saw them. Sir, I suggest they\u8217\'92ve gone ahead into the building.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was the first up the stair,\u8221\'94 Pyetle countered. \u8220\'93I saw no one enter. They were }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 behind!}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I suggest that\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No suggestions! I want facts!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Vessel shrank back, and Pyetle took a moment to compose himself. He then strode towards the cliff behind him, but promptly dismissed the possibility that the giant had jumped from such a height. His next suspicion fell upon Elrahet. He strode towards the old witch, accusation thick in his step. He towered over her as as the building towered over him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is your brute?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I should guess,\u8221\'94 Elrahet mumbled, \u8220\'93That he fled.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle clicked his tongue, and an insubordinate piped up, saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uglies on scales says she knows where he is.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Half the Vessels murmured agreement, and before Pyetle could regain order, a shout came from the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s entrance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sir! There }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  someone in there!\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle spun around and hurried up to the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s blood-stained threshold. He drew his sword as if to do battle with the rock, then peered inside its yawning mouth. After a moment\u8217\'92s inspection, he shouted, \u8220\'93Fetch the pokes!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was picked up, carried, and dropped at Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet. The rest of the Ayramun were borne forth in a similar manner.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One of you get a torch going,\u8221\'94 Pyetle demanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto unshouldered his pack and quickly found the materials for a torch and assembled it. He then laid out a separate bundle of tinder, knapped sparks onto it, encouraged a meager flame with a blown kiss, then set torch\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pitch-wrapped head ablaze. He then offered the torch to Pyetle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said. \u8220\'93You are going in first.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto shrugged his shoulders and casually strolled towards the mouth of the mountain, and thrust his torch into its interior.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He immediately spun around and cupped his nose in the crook of his elbow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It smells like stale piss.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All piss smells stale,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You would know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get on with it,\u8221\'94 Pyetle commanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto turned back, held his torch aloft and stepped into the darkness. Pyetle followed along with a few of his men, weapons ready. Mandri and the others were forced in behind, followed by a spill of Vessels.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a Lord\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s barge, thrice as long, and at least four times Mandri\u8217\'92s height. Moto\u8217\'92s torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had tossed some of this ash around the room, leaving white trails sprinkled across the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing those gathered, was a man sitting cross-legged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto halted and waved his torch back and forth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The man did not move.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hello!\u8221\'94 Moto shouted, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible skin was his nose which peeked out from behind the fall of his black, ash splattered hair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Prolly dead,\u8221\'94 Seb marked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think so?\u8221\'94 said Moto dryly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who\u8217\'92s the one who said \u8216\'91hello\u8217\'92 to it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle made a grasping motion towards Moto, requesting the torch. Moto gave it. With the torchlight leading the way, Pyetle approached the mysterious figure. The rest of his men filtered into the depths of the room, each with much less surety in their step.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Must have been living on mice,\u8221\'94 Moto said as he kicked a small spine that was lying on the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bats too,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 More torches flared up to reveal a floor rich in the scattered remains of all manner of small creatures\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 thin boned lizard legs, bats, birds, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. This was the den of a beast. All were quieted by the gruesome sight, all save Elrahet, whose heavy robes were }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 dragging through the ash, dirt, and bones, as s}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 he waddled right up to the cross-legged figure.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Move aside,\u8221\'94 she barked at Pyetle, and then she poked the sitting man with her cane.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head slumped onto his shoulder and his hair fell away from his cheek. Elrahet poked again, and he fell onto his side. The thump of his impact kicked up a cloud of ash.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Dead,\u8221\'94 Elrahet declared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She rubbed the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s green robe between her gnarled fingers. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Viggy wool,\u8221\'94 she said confidently. \u8220\'93The raiment of a prince. Greskal\u8217\'92s son.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle spread the light of his torch onto several more pitch-strapped sticks and handed them out to his men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that who who we\u8217\'92ve come to hunt?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93Though he might have been. See there\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She pointed towards a dark lump on the floor about an arm\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s length behind the dead prince. That lump had a mop of dark hair and a human ear. It had a neck, and attached to that neck were a few links of spine. What mangled flesh there was appeared to have been munched on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes darted between this horror and green robed prince.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You suggest that this man }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 ate}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  the other?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s natural scowl hardened. \u8220\'93Do not judge this boy,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93He was braver than any of you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She grabbed Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm and forced his torch low against the fire-pit. With her cane, she poked around in the ash to reveal, buried deeply, a large stomach. Evidently the green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it his intestines. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If he had lost his battle,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said, \u8220\'93we\u8217\'92d have two Burshageets to hunt instead of one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Burshageet?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked, but Elrahet was too busy rolling the stomach around in its bed of ash to clarify.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And what a sight. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The stomach\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pinkish flesh was sticky, with a film of ash, seared in patches, and as it rolled some part of it squelched and fizzled, as if it were still digesting something foul.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet pulled out her black knife, and with a quick, terrible stroke, she cut the stomach open. She knelt down, reached, and carefully spread the halves apart. Then she leaned over it to divine the future, or, perhaps she sought the past. Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew only that the stomach was the seat of the Spark and that the organ was subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there were patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the true meaning of events with those folds, but predict them altogether. But his was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, after half a finger of silent staring, that he would understand anything. Then the dissected stomach squirmed and burped up a puff of black smoke that spread unnaturally quick throughout the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It did not take a witch to interpret this sign.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All knew by way of myth what a Spark looked like when it was snuffed out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The astonished crowd backed away from the fire-pit, and half-eaten bones crunched under their feet. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Evil!\u8221\'94 one cracking Vessel shouted, while another\u8217\'92s resolve shattered completely. This one fell to his knees and muttered a warding prayer, while a third man lowered his spear towards Elrahet with an aim to end her then and there.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Calm yourselves,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said, raising his hand. His voice was low and measured, as if he\u8217\'92d stood in darker rooms than this. But where before his men had flouted ominous things, now they were enraptured by them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There were skeletons strewn about.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet had bewitched the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Any reasonable person would flee.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri pulled away from his guarding Vessels and snuck past a crowd of rapt soldiers. His intention was to escape out into the uncorrupted air. But he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t get far, for a glint of shiny metal caught his eye. He looked closely, and yes, hanging above the threshold was an enormous golden mask in the image of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a rare Old Jandri relic. The facial planes were bloated with healthy fat. Long, curved lines traced the contours of the cheek and bulbous chin like tattoos. Heavy lidded eyes lent His visage a sense of serenity. Mandri was drawn to it, even if the style was long outlawed by Hrk. It was sacrilegious to depict Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s features with such definition. One must not claim knowledge of such things. Only the most abstract representation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a circle\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 would do. Even stretching that circle into an oval so as to suggest a jaw and masculinity was forbidden on pain of having to start all over again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And this mask was huge, at least two heads tall. Hrkan sacral masks could be worn, but this was much too large. And when Hrkan masks were out of use, they were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, but this hung out in the open, mounted on a bronze plate and pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a beautiful sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Though none of it glittered as brightly as it should. A thin layer of dust dulled its luster. Fire-lorn ash speckled His face like freckles. All this could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. What could not be forgiven was how His golden skin was darkly mottled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tarnished.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pure gold cannot tarnish. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 That meant the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No wonder these people were missing, they deserved a smiting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And worse, standing at the foot of the entrance arch were two long-necked shooki jugs\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 jugs of urine. It was impossible to say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which could not be ignored. Surely the Greskalun were bathing their god in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish. One indignity to wash away another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They should have settled for a smaller Solraheen,\u8221\'94 Mandri mumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked from the center of the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A soldier nearby noticed Mandri staring up at the face of Solraheen, and this man pointed out the discovery as his own.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A sacral mask!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This drew the attention of several torches to the shadow of the entrance wall. The approaching light revealed a design which stirred a thrill of disbelief, for radiating out of that golden mask, in sharp sandstone relief, were one hundred and twenty long triangles\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the overlapping rays of the sun. The number did not need to be counted for the pattern exactly matched the sigil of Hrk. The only real difference between this wall and the Hrkan design was how the sharp points of these splayed sun-rays here terminated into the mouths of worried faces. These faces were carved with such realism that Mandri actually felt repulsed by the threat of skill. He wanted, again, to flee, but the Hrks were crowding in.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this doing here?\u8221\'94 one gruff fellow sneered. His warted nose sniffled as he spoke, as even the hairs inside his nostrils were stood on end.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why should these pokes honor us?\u8221\'94 asked another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Honor?\u8221\'94 The warted one gasped. \u8220\'93This is defilement! They mock us!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They mock Solraheen,\u8221\'94 said yet another Vessel. \u8220\'93A mask of impure gold is damnable work.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All agreed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One man called to tear the whole wall down, prompting another to stab the stonework with his spear. He aimed for the nose of one the light-swallowing figures, but it was the spear\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s edge which cracked and split. A shard of the blunted iron was sent tinging along the floor, and into the echo of tinging metal there crept a cackling, shrill and deeply amused.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All men turned to face Elrahet. All were upset by her peculiar visage, for so close to the floor was she, with all but her ancient face obscured by her pillowing robes, that she appeared to have reverted to some accursed larval stage.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you not Hrkan men?\u8221\'94 she jeered. \u8220\'93Will none of you bow to the sigil of your Lordship?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The crowd of white cloaks were loathe to hear her speak, much less tease them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have your histories forgotten Shulgi already?\u8221\'94 she asked, eying them all with a cold and steady gaze. When she found Pyetle\u8217\'92s questioning glare, she answered it. \u8220\'93This place is a prison.\u8221\'94 Her lips curled at the final word, and Pyetle stiffened.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The demon we hunt is imprisoned here?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She shook her head, then said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brow scrunched up tight. \u8220\'93Are you saying the god of all creation is imprisoned here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 was}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 ,\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 she clarified. \u8220\'93He did escape.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would have bet that He did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet grunted, then stood back up with effort. Her crooked figure emerged out of her mound of robes like a wilted stalk freshly watered. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Every mind is bound by the power of the word,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 Duty. Honor. Oath.}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  These words bind you to this place as readily as Solraheen was bound by the repetition of His name. If you had heard the words\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is not the time for stories,\u8221\'94 Pyetle muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you had heard His name repeated,\u8221\'94 she said fervently, \u8220\'93each note entering on the finger, each new voice swelling the chord until the wash of noise did shake the earth\u8230\'85such was the echo that one and twenty blossomed into twelve and thousands!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She was speaking now to the ceiling, to the stars beyond the rock, and Mandri thought he saw a younger face beneath her wrinkling years. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It did subdue Him,\u8221\'94 she claimed. \u8220\'93For an age, it stilled His being.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And I suppose,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said with a sneer, \u8220\'93That there was a witch involved, warning everyone against this course of action?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 An unsteady frown tugged at the edge of Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lips. \u8220\'93None could foresee how Schisol\u8217\'92s yearning would inviscerate the choir with gold.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t quite follow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nor should you!\u8221\'94 Elrahet snipped. \u8220\'93That path leads down to the stomach. It is foolish to venture there without aid of a Mazid. This\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94 she said,  gesturing broadly at the carnage in the room, \u8220\'93is a warning!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle glared at the crumpled body of the dead prince. Ash-splattered green wool covered the Prince\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wilted shoulder and twisted knee. Even for a corpse, it looked uncomfortable. Then Pyetle\u8217\'92s gaze turned to the stomach still sizzling in the ash. He breathed deeply to find his courage.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Something nearby needs killing,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I know better than to hold an old witch\u8217\'92s enthusiasms against her, but your insistence that we should leave directs my suspicions. It appears as though you are protecting something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fool!\u8221\'94 Elrahet screeched, and when Pyetle smirked, fury gripped her. She stabbed the floor with her cane. \u8220\'93How able will your service be to the Lordship be if you are DEAD!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Her passion imprinted itself on the mind as only truth itself could do, and for a moment it seemed as if she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d convinced them all to flee.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle, with all his scribal swagger, inclined his head and drew his smirk wider. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Me and mine are more than willing to die should the Lordship require it. There is no greater service than sacrifice.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He then looked to his men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Apprehension darkened the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Isn\u8217\'92t that right?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This question of honor hung in the air unanswered. There were hesitant glances, stifled stutters, as those unsure of the moment were confronted with their oaths. Mandri doubted Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fortifying glare would move them, but then, without any order, the Vessels straightened up and gathered into their squares. They squeezed shoulder to shoulder, brushing animal bones aside with their shuffling feet. At once, they were ready for command.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Slate!\u8221\'94 Pyetle called, and the only Hrk in the room not wearing a headscarf stepped forward. This man, named Slate, was flat-faced with wide-set eyes and a bald, gleaming pate, presumably his namesake. His name could have also derived from his flat expression. He did not appear to be a thinking man. More than this, Mandri was struck by the sense that Slate\u8217\'92s blocky head could not, even in principle, be painted. His chin looked strong from from the front but was rather steep and weak from the side, while his nose was practically a wall from the front, but barely there from any other angle. With a skull so wide and flat, no two-dimensional account of him could be made. It gave him the impression of having been sculpted by a middling hand who refused to use a reference model. Indeed, sculpting a man like Slate was just the kind of thing Pyetle would do. The man needed humbling. which was picking and choosing which of his men would die.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle claimed they were choosing who to send to hunt down Ayram, but this was only a pretext. Those sent out of the temple would be spared from certain death. Everyone else would wander deeper into this ancient prison, down to its stomach perhaps, likely never to return. Slate, Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s second in command, was enlisted help him choose who was who. Slate pointed out the shifters, the fidgeters, the men too eager for eye contact. Curiosity, as well, was a sign of weakness. It was well known that a dominant man has no need of curiosity, for he knows exactly where he stands in his environment\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 on the top.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle waved all these suggestions away. To Slate\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s great disappointment, he opted to release the men with families, as well as the men who were nearing the end of their contracts. These men were gathered and dismissed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There were only thirty-odd Vessels remaining. The condensed into tighter squares, and Pyetle kicked up a strut in front them. His pace was building up to a speech.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen put you here,\u8221\'94 he said proudly, pointing to the golden mask above the entrance.  \u8220\'93He guided you, all through your long life, so that you would be standing here, here and now. He guided each one of you to this very moment.\u8221\'94 He paused to let the weight of this obligation settle on proud shoulders. \u8220\'93You are not unlucky to be here,\u8221\'94 he continued. \u8220\'93Get rid of that feeling, if it is there. You are lucky. Few get to meet evil with the clarity that you do now. How will you respond? Will you charge into the dark and kill what festers there? It is easy to say yes. But are you willing to die to kill it? I am. I am, because I will die with the luxury of knowing exactly what I\u8217\'92ll say to Solraheen when I meet Him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What will you say?\u8221\'94 Slate asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll say send me back! So that I can finish the job!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Slate encouraged a weak hurrah, and Pyetle swept this mild feeling up by drawing his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Think of your name being nailed to the head of a demon as children parade it down the Whiteway!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Think of the women!\u8221\'94 Slate shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The meaty women!\u8221\'94 Pyetle repeated to a swell of heartier cheers. And with their courage half-gathered, Pyetle marched into the dark passage that was barely there in the distant end of the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Of course, Mandri was forced to trudge along. He did not share in the Hrks excited visions of victory. It was almost like they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d all completely forgotten that they\u8217\'92d just seen a Spark dissolve into wisps of smoke.}}
