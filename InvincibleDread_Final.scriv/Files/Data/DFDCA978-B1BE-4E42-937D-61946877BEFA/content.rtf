Mandri suspected they\u8217\'92d refined some secret oil bath which held the cloth strong against the smear of sand and sweat. The men themselves, however, were not as robust. They unraveled as soon as they stepped through the tower\u8217\'92s tunnel and saw the courtyard skewered with pilgrim poles. Half cried out at the smell, a few vomited, the rest became enraged. Their robes, however, their robes were pristine. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle was the only level head amongst them. He barked orders with clean diction, orders assiduously planned for such an unexpected situation. He reorganized his men into their squares, formed a squad of the literate to anatomize the scene, dispatched messengers to the nearest outpost, and sent scouts up winding gulches to seek the source of water which fed this tower. He had them look for foraging opportunities as well, for a continued journey, as well as a return journey. Moto muttered something about how there wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be a return journey, implying death, and Pyetle laughed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We can manage whatever demons dwell in these mountains,\u8221\'94 he said with a grin, and with that smile he ordered the Ayramun to be split up. Ayram himself was to move ahead and give tongue the moment he caught sign of their quarry. Ayram assented with a nod.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a winding canyon. Once around the fist bend, Ayram scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree. He stood up on a cropped boulder and glared back down, expecting everyone else to follow. A few did, among them Elrahet, escorted by a few Vessels, and when they finally made it up to Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s perch, Pyetle ordered everyone to stop.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe then ducked into a huddle of his commanders and began to scheme. Whispered rumor of their plans eventually made it back through the ranks to Mandri, and the word was that Moteah and the horse were going to be kept behind in the tower, with a small bevy of Vessels to watch over them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri expected as much. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t like the Hrks to let a potential threat like Mandri to go untroubled, and removing Moteah from this operation would effectively neutralize him. It was a sensible idea, if one ignored the specter of a great demon haunting these mountains. If that demon was real, and if it was true that it couldn\u8217\'92t be harmed by mortal strength, then there would be no recourse for this eclectic bunch of fools. So it might be a very bad idea to leave Moteah behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Perhaps, being a practical man, Pyetle thought it better to dismantle a threat which already exists instead of preserving it to deal with a threat which only }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 might}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  exist. That much was sensible, even if it was likely to end in tragedy. Mandri could not articulate why, but he believed that there really was a great demon hiding somewhere in this maze of rock. He supposed he believed it because he believed Elrahet. How could he not? Sure, there were always good reasons to doubt a witch, but it was a difficult to remember those reasons when there she was, standing high up on her perch like a crow, back bent with a peevish beak, herald of a day of death with the sun was already high and behind her. Her stooped figure cast such a long shadow down the length of the slope, a shadow thorned by the contours of jumbled rock, sticking here and there into the manicured robes of men who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d paused their climb. Somehow, all these Vessels had managed to ignore her aura of gloom. They instead busied themselves with waiting, as soldiers were want to do. One tall fellow with a tilted chin and rebellious teeth was taking quiet bets on who among the pokes would be executed first. Moto, quarrelsome as he was, had the best odds. Most of the rest were tending to minor aches and trying to forget the sight and smell of those pilgrim poles. A remarkable few had already forgotten that ordeal and were dreaming out loud, in a competitive sort of way, about women. Then Elrahet grumbled something unintelligible, and her grumbling rolled down the rocky slope like warning stones before a landslide, quieting them all. Even Pyetle\u8217\'92s huddle paused their scheming to wonder if they\u8217\'92d just been cursed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A Vessel nearest Mandri, a hard men with a cleft chin and hairy neck, shouted a crude counter curse\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shove it back down your throat!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 An odd chuckle cheered him on, followed by a hearty laugh. Another brave Spark shouted up at the grumpy witch, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you missed your nap?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet frowned at the laughing crowd then shouted back, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you value your lives, you will bring the girl along!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A few Vessels tried to pull her from her perch, but she poked them away with her cane, then returned hire ire to the milling crowd. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Only Mazidfire can defeat what awaits us! Without the girl, we are dead!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle stood up on a rock so that he could set his wide, proud smile above the fluff of headwraps, shoulders, and spears. He said, grandly, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would be a poor mirror for the Lordship if I were to trust a witch outright.\u8221\'94 He then turned to address Elrahet directly. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93The girl will stay behind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stood tiptoe to get a better look at Pyetle. Because this was one of the memorable things about leaders of men, how they projected certainty when in truth they were as damned by ignorance as everyone else. In this respect, Pyetle was a great leader. He was tugging his beard like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d just outplayed a rival, even though Elrahet wasn\u8217\'92t the kind of witch who played games. It was enough, at least, for his men to see those three rings on his pinching fingers, thin silver bands which marked three years of study in logic, rhetoric, and calculation. Yes, those scribal fingers swelled with intellect as they pulled insight out at the root. How could such a man, with such education, misjudge anything?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Unleashing your Mazid upon the world,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said, \u8220\'93would defeat the whole purpose of our being here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet did not reply. She simply stood there and matched Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stubborn look with her own look of doom. When Pyetle dismissed her scowl with a laugh, she snarled and addressed the crowd. \u8220\'93Come then, Hrkmen! Do leave the girl and a few behind. You\u8217\'92ll need their hands to tender your carcass to the knackers.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Vessels seized her by the shoulders and waist, and she allowed her self to be taken. Pyetle, smirking, gave his men a perfunctory nod, then hopped down off his rock and returned to his schemes, ignoring the wary glances spreading through the ranks. Still, the mood was even. None grumbled at his orders. Even Mandri was inclined to carry on with the hunt, for he could sense an ending up at the top of that slope. This darkbright feeling was magnified by the sound of hooves carrying Moteah away. Each clip-clop prickled his skin. He did not dare to watch her ride off, bouncing in the saddle, lest her fear begin to bleed into him more than it already was. He wondered, briefly, why he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t been blaming her for his many moods this whole long while. The convenience had always been there. Then he was pushed in the back and ordered to climb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The slope might as well have been a wall of thorns to his unworked hands. He was already starting to lose his anxious energy when he pulled himself up to the shelf of rock where the Vessels were gathering. Then one of them, a swarthy fellow with a pouncing glare, spat on his shoes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the last bit of water you\u8217\'92ll take from me!\u8221\'94 the man declared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Other Vessels heard and joined in with insults of their own. Evidently they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been driven hard for days without stopping to find a well, and for whatever reason, they blamed Mandri for this instead of Pyetle. One man even patted Mandri\u8217\'92s robes, looking for a waterskin to steal. Finding none, he accidentally-on-purpose elbowed Mandri in the ribs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When everyone had climbed up to this wide shelf, Pyetle had the Ayramun split apart again. Ayram, still the wayfinder, was kept in front, while Elrahet was pulled back to the rear. Mandri moved somewhere in the middle, sandwiched between two unwashed loaves of men, while Seb and Moto were lost amongst the horde. On they went, traveling along this sinuous cliff of rock which traced the proper road below. Eventually, the way dipped into a narrow crack set into in the northern rock face. This opening was hardly wider than Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders, but Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 One by one, they all squeezed into this spindly chasm, where stacked layers of red and redder rock had been split by Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s curse, then bent by the ages into dramatic, sweeping forms. Both sides bracketed a thin, winding strip of blue sky above. Such was the height and swerve of the walls that direct sunlight could not touch the mush of sand and fallen rock that was the floor. Still, light bounced down, and the shadowy way was warm with peachy color. Mandri did not have time to appreciate the beauty, as it was difficult enough for him to keep up with the march. And they marched for good long while, such that the sun had time to hop over the streamlet of sky above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 After a hand or two, or perhaps three, the way belled out where a length of the chasm on either side had collapsed to open up a valley. The slopes bulged with piles of red stone. To the left, towering above the rubble, was the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision. Above that plateau was the blazing, latter-day sun. Below, sheltering in the shadows of the larger rocks, were stands of white Vessels. Seb was among them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Almost there,\u8221\'94 she said upon seeing Mandri\u8217\'92s pained expression.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Almost where?\u8221\'94 he asked, but a pox-scarred soldier got between them and pushed Seb onwards.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 From there, the Hrkan march stretched out into a trickle. White-robed Vessels dribbled up and down rubble strewn paths, poking their spears into holes, looking for demons. The sky above dimmed into its deeper hues. When the shadows were dark, the way turned again into a scramble which lead steeply upwards until emptying out onto the heights of a grand plateau. When Mandri finally lifted his eyes from the ankle-twisting rocks, he saw, some hundred yards away, the start of a dizzying staircase rising up to another, smaller, but still massive, plateau. Halfway through a tired groan, he realized that the plateau in front of him, that monumental knob of rock, was actually a building. }
\par\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In form, this grand structure was simple, like a common pot set upside down. In detail, it was as busy as could be, with complex patterns incised into its skin. These were simple geometric shapes\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 diamonds, squares, circles\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and they were everywhere joined together to make abstract faces. Animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gape. The nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the skull of a mouse. There wasn\u8217\'92t one blank spot on this monumental canvas, and this parade of creation wrapped all the way around the structure like a belt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had trouble thinking through his astonishment. He had never seen the like. All the man-made wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this ancient structure should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of Outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered vitalize the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crowns, and that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not even accounting for the effects of the setting sun\u8217\'92s rays painting the stone with flame. The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Lords did not know of it. If they had, the building would have been reduced to a painting a long, long time ago.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 These Vessels would have an easier time of conquering it now, because the structure appeared to be abandoned. If it were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter brushed with the scent of a female. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Before Mandri knew it, it was his turn to climb the stairs. He took his time. There were at least two-hundred steps, and they were each steep and uneven, like layers of melted wax. A dark stain was climbing up them. Mandri guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t oil, well, it could be any number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a temple that large had to drain out somewhere. Odd that they\u8217\'92d have it running out the front door. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 But he knew it was blood. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Because of course it was blood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t any people where people were expected to be.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 They were hunting a demon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Blood explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under his skin. It explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. And that wasn\u8217\'92t the end of it, for the many faces etched into the rocky wall collapsed into a chaotic swirl of lines just above a curved entrance arch, as if being sucked into the interior, or spewed out of it, and all of them were stained in their grooves by that same dark substance which dripped down the stairs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Yes, that temple entrance was a blood-stained maw.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Perhaps the demon they were seeking was the mountain itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Perhaps it had eaten the Greskalun. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 More explanatory power.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Form up!\u8221\'94 Pyetle barked, his voice a little slimmer in this thinner air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A Vessel grabbed Mandri by the neck and arranged him alongside the assembling Hrkan squares. When they were all formed up atop that table of rock, Pyetle began a formal review. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His eyes ticked from face to face. Mandri expected to see pride instilling bravery, but there was anger in his eyes, and panic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is he!?\u8221\'94 Pyetle shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No one answered. A few risked sheepish glances to try and puzzle out who he was referring to.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is the giant!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri searched for Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s towering frame, which should have been standing out like a black mast in a sea of white robes. He was missing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who was keeping the giant!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A man in the first square wavered for a moment, then stepped forward. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was Dar and Fally,\u8221\'94 he said, anxiety rippling his words. \u8220\'93They appear to be missing. They were with the giant. I saw them. Sir, I suggest they\u8217\'92ve gone ahead into the building.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was the first up the stair,\u8221\'94 Pyetle countered. \u8220\'93I saw no one enter. They were }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 behind!}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I suggest that\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No suggestions! I want facts!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The man shrank back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle took a moment to compose himself. He then strode towards the man-made cliff behind him, as both sides of the court dropped vertically down, but he promptly dismissed the possibility that the giant had jumped from such a height. His next suspicion fell upon Elrahet. He strode towards the old witch, insinuation thick in his step. He towered over her as as the building towered over him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is he?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri could not see Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s reaction, but he could watch it work to infuriate Pyetle\u8217\'92s round face. The man\u8217\'92s right eye twitched. His full lips curled into a frown. His stiff beard quivered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I should guess,\u8221\'94 Elrahet mumbled, \u8220\'93That he fled.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The beardless Vessel next to her clicked his tongue. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uglies on scales says she knows where he is.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Half the Vessels murmured agreement, and before Pyetle could regain order, a shout came from the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s entrance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sir! There }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  someone in there!\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle spun around and hurried up to the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stained threshold. He drew his sword as if to do battle with the rock, then peered inside. After a moment\u8217\'92s inspection, he shouted, \u8220\'93Fetch the pokes!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was picked up, carried, and dropped at Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet. The rest of the Ayramun were borne forth in a similar manner, save for Elrahet. She was driven towards the entrance arch by the threat of a spear, as none dared risk setting skin to skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One of you get a torch going,\u8221\'94 Pyetle demanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto unshouldered his pack and quickly found the materials for a torch and assembled it. He then laid out a bundle of dried tinder, then knapped sparks onto it, then set this meager flame to torch\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pitch-wrapped head. Once burning, he offered the torch to Pyetle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said. \u8220\'93You are going in first.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto shrugged his shoulders\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 his way of calling Pyetle a coward. He casually strolled woards the mouth of the mountain, and thrust his torch into its interior.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He immediately spun around and cupped his nose with the crook of his elbow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It smells like stale piss.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All piss smells stale,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You would know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get on with it,\u8221\'94 Pyetle commanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto turned back, held his torch aloft and stepped into the darkness. Pyetle followed along with a few of his men, weapons ready. Mandri and the others were forced in behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a Lord\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s barge, thrice as long, and at least four times Mandri\u8217\'92s height. Moto\u8217\'92s torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had tossed some of this ash around the room, leaving white trails sprinkled across the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing those gathered, was a man sitting cross-legged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto halted and waved his torch back and forth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The man did not move.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hello!\u8221\'94 Moto shouted, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible skin was his nose which peeked out from behind the fall of his black, ash splattered hair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Prolly dead,\u8221\'94 Seb marked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think so?\u8221\'94 said Moto dryly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who\u8217\'92s the one who said \u8216\'91hello\u8217\'92 to it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle made a grasping motion towards Moto, requesting the torch. Moto gave it. With the torchlight leading the way, Pyetle approached the mysterious figure. The rest of his men filtered into the room, each with much less surety in their step.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Must have living on mice,\u8221\'94 Moto said as he kicked a small spine that was lying on the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bats,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scattered remains of all manner of small creatures poked out of every shadow\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 thin boned lizard legs, bats, birds, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. For a moment there, Mandri was almost happy to be \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91inside\u8217\'92, because that was a state of being that he forgot existed after spending so many days wandering in the wilderness. But this was the den of a beast.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Then Elrahet waddled in. Her heavy robes }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 dragged through the ash, dirt, and bones. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She stepped right up to the cross-legged figure as if he were her next meal, and she poked him with her cane.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head slumped onto his shoulder and his hair fell away from his cheek. Elrahet poked again, and he fell onto his side. The thump of his impact kicked up a cloud of ash.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Dead,\u8221\'94 Elrahet declared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She rubbed the dead man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robe between her gnarled fingers. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Viggy wool,\u8221\'94 she said confidently. \u8220\'93The raiment of a prince. Greskal\u8217\'92s son.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle spread the light of his torch onto several more pitch-strapped sticks and handed them out to his men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that who who we\u8217\'92ve come to hunt?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93Though he might have been. See there\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She pointed towards a dark lump on the floor about an arm\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s length behind the dead prince. That lump had a mop of dark hair and a human ear. It had a neck, and attached to that neck were a few links of spine. What mangled flesh there was appeared to have been munched on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes darted between this horror and green robed prince.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You suggest that this man }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 ate}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  the other?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s natural scowl deepened. \u8220\'93Do not judge this boy,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93He was braver than any of you. See here\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She grabbed Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm and forced his torch low against the fire-pit. With her cane, she poked around in the ash to reveal, buried deeply, a large stomach. Evidently the green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it his intestines, which were cut as well and tossed inside. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If he had lost his battle,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said, \u8220\'93we\u8217\'92d have two Burshageets to hunt instead of one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Burshageet?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked, but Elrahet was too busy rolling the stomach around in its bed of ash to clarify.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And what a sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The stomach\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pinkish flesh was sticky, stained white, seared in patches, and as it turned some part of it squelched and fizzled, as if it were still digesting cinders.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet pulled out her black knife, and with a quick, terrible stroke, she cut the stomach open. She knelt down, reached, and carefully spread the halves apart. Then she leaned over it to divine the future, or, perhaps she sought the past. Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew only that the stomach was the seat of the Spark and that the organ was subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there were patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the true meaning of events with those folds, but predict them altogether. But his was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, after half a finger of silent staring, that he would understand anything. Then the dissected stomach squirmed and burped up a puff of black smoke that spread unnaturally quick throughout the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It did not take a witch to interpret this sign.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All knew by way of myth what a Spark looked like when it was snuffed out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A curse upon us!\u8221\'94 one Vessel shouted, his voice cracking as he backed away from the fire-pit. Half-eaten bones crunched under his feet, causing another soldier\u8217\'92s resolve to break entirely. This one fell to his knees and muttered a warding prayer while a third man lowered his spear towards Elrahet with an aim to solve all the world\u8217\'92s ills.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle raised his hand with the quiet gravity of someone who had stood in darker rooms than this. His voice, low and measured, snipped the budding panic at the root. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Calm yourselves,\u8221\'94 he said, and somehow, they were calmed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri, however, was not not so easily swayed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There were skeletons strewn about.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet had bewitched the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was no sense in flouting these ominous things. One should flee.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He pulled away from his guarding Vessel and snuck past a crowd of rapt soldiers with the intention of at posting himself nearer the entrance. He was stopped from leaving the temple altogether by the glint of shiny metal hanging above the threshold. He looked up and saw an enormous golden mask in the image of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a rare Old Jandri relic, though a common design, where the facial planes were bloated with healthy fat. Long, curved lines traced the contours like tattoos\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the cheeks, the chin, lips, and so on. Heavy lidded eyes lent His visage a look serenity. Mandri loved it, even if the style was long outlawed by Hrk. Evidently it was sacrilegious to depict Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s features with such definition. One must not claim knowledge of such things. Only the most abstract representation\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a circle\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 would do. Even stretching that circle into an oval so as to suggest a jaw and masculinity was forbidden on pain of having to start all over again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This mask was huge, at least two heads tall. Hrkan sacral masks could actually be worn, but this was much too large. And when Hrkan masks were out of use, they were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, but this hung out in the open, mounted on a bronze plate and pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It was a beautiful sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Though none of it glittered as brightly as it should.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A thin layer of dust dulled its luster. Fire-lorn ash speckled His face like freckles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 All this could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. What could not be forgiven was how His golden skin was darkly mottled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Tarnished.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pure gold cannot tarnish. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 No wonder they were missing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And worse, standing at the foot of the entrance arch were two long-necked shooki jugs\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 jugs of urine. It was impossible to say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which could not be ignored. Surely the Greskalun were bathing their god in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish. One indignity to wash away another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They should have settled for a smaller Solraheen,\u8221\'94 Mandri mumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked from the center of the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A soldier near Mandri noticed Mandri staring up at the face of Solraheen. He pointed out this discovery and exclaimed, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A sacral mask!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This drew the attention of several torches to the shadow of the threshold wall. Their approaching light revealed a design which stirred a thrill of disbelief. At the center of it all was the golden mask. Radiating out of it, in sharp sandstone relief, were one hundred and twenty overlapping triangles\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 rays of the sun. The number did not need to be counted for the pattern exactly matched the sigil of Hrk. The only real difference between this wall and the design on Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s badge was how the sharp points of these splayed sun-rays terminated into the mouths of worried faces. These faces were carved with such realism that Mandri felt repulsed by the threat of skill. These sculpted heads felt alive, as if there were people there, stuck inside the stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He wanted, again, to flee, but the Hrks crowded in.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this doing here?\u8221\'94 one gruff fellow sneered. His warted nose sniffled as he spoke, for even the hairs inside his nostrils were stood on end.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why should these pokes honor us?\u8221\'94 asked another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Honor?\u8221\'94 The warted one gasped. \u8220\'93This is defilement! They mock us!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They mock Solraheen,\u8221\'94 said yet another Vessel. \u8220\'93A mask of impure gold is damnable work.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet cackling laugh rose like a specter beside the fire-pit. So close to the floor was she, with all but her face was obscured by her pillowing robes, that she appeared to have reverted to her larval stage. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you not Hrkan men?\u8221\'94 she jeered. \u8220\'93Will none of you bow to the sigil of your Lordship?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The crowd of white cloaks were loathe to hear her speak, much less tease them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Calm yourselves,\u8221\'94 Pyetle chided. \u8220\'93You know better than to hold an old witch\u8217\'92s enthusiasms against her. She\u8217\'92s only trying to that we\u8217\'92ve forgetting about her giant. Aren\u8217\'92t you?\u8221\'94 He \u8220\'93It will go better for you, if you tell me he where is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is not here,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said blankly. \u8220\'93I expect he is afraid this hunt will fail, for it will fail. Your refusal to bring the Mazid\u8217\'92s Minder has sealed that fate.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that so?\u8221\'94 Pyetle said through a chuckle. \u8220\'93I suppose you\u8217\'92ll next suggest that I\u8217\'92ve doomed the world. Every witch whines about the doom of the world. You aren\u8217\'92t the only ones. It\u8217\'92s not an unpopular sentiment.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then finish it.\u8221\'94 She said gruffly. \u8220\'93Be done with me and mine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It may come to that. Something nearby needs killing, and that may well be you. It is to be determined. First we have to search this temple.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is no temple.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is a prison.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The demon we hunt is imprisoned here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Elrahet grimaced as if offended.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have your histories forgotten Shulgi already?\u8221\'94 She eyed the crowd of soldiers now. Her gaze, cold and steady, made her seem like a snake deciding whether or not to strike. \u8220\'93This prison was built for Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle cocked his head as if he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t heard correctly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The god of all creation? Imprisoned?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He did escape,\u8221\'94 Elrahet clarified.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would have bet that He did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A few Hrks laughed in agreement, but Elrahet was not amused. She stood back up with effort, her crooked figure emerging out of her mound of robes like a __. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Every mind is bound by the power of the word,\u8221\'94 she said fervently. \u8220\'93}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 Duty. Honor. Oath.}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  These words bind you to this place as readily as Solraheen was bound by the repetition of His name. If you had heard the words\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is not the time for stories,\u8221\'94 Pyetle muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you had heard His name shattered a hundred fold, each note entering on the finger, each new voice swelling the chord until the wash of noise did shake the earth\u8230\'85such was the echo that one and twenty blossomed into twelve and thousands!\u8221\'94 Elrahet lifted her eyes from the shadow of her cowl and for a moment Mandri saw a younger face beneath her wrinkling years. \u8220\'93It did subdue Him,\u8221\'94 she asserted. \u8220\'93For an age, it stilled His being.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And I suppose,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said with a sneer, \u8220\'93That there was a witch involved, warning everyone against this course of action?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94 Elrahet\u8217\'92s}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  gnarled hands trembled on her cane. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The choir was strong!\u8221\'94 An unsteady frown tugged at the edge of her lips. \u8220\'93Then Schisol\u8217\'92s yearning seeped into their mouths\u8230\'85they were all of them inviscerated with gold.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t quite follow,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nor should you!\u8221\'94 Elrahet snipped. \u8220\'93We should leave this place! It is foolish to stay without the aid of godfire.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle appeared to appreciate Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sincerity, but in the end he smiled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your insistence that I should leave only deepens my resolve.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He then looked to his men. Apprehension and confusion crossed their faces. But he said nothing. His stillness was enough to move them. They gathered into their squares, squeezing shoulder to shoulder, brushing animal bones aside with their shuffling feet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Slate!\u8221\'94 Pyetle called, and the only Hrk in the room not wearing a headscarf stepped forward. This man, named Slate, was flat-faced with wide-set eyes and a bald, gleaming pate, presumably his namesake. His name could have also been derived from his flat expression. He did not appear to be a thinking man. He even moved like rolling stone, squat and bouncy, tossed by Pyetle\u8217\'92s whim. More than this, Mandri was struck by the sense that Slate\u8217\'92s blocky head could not, even in principle, be painted. His chin looked strong from from the front but was rather steep and weak from the side, while his nose was practically a wall from the front, but barely there from any other angle. With a skull so wide and flat, no two-dimensional account of him could be made. It gave him the impression of having been sculpted by a middling hand who refused to use a reference model. Young scribblers were often stubborn in that way. It was the kind of mind which needed humbling. Like Pyetle\u8217\'92s. Indeed, sculpting a man like Slate would be only a small display of hubris compared to Pyetle\u8217\'92s current endeavor, which was picking and choosing which of his men would die. Slate, his apparent second in command, was to help him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle claimed they were choosing who to send to hunt down Ayram, but Mandri knew this was only a pretext\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 those sent out of the temple would be spared from certain death. Everyone else would venture deeper into this prison, down to its stomach perhaps, likely never to return. Blank wanted to cull the cowardly men from their adventuring party\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he pointed out the shifters, the fidgeters, the men too eager for eye contact. Curiosity, as well, was a sign of weakness. A dominant man has no need of curiosity as he knows where he stood relative to his environment.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Pyetle waved all these suggestions away. He opted to release the men with families, as well as the men who were nearing the end of their contracts. These men were gathered and dismissed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Once they were out into the settling night, Pyetle kicked up a strut in front his twenty-odd remaining men. His pace was building up to a speech.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen put you here,\u8221\'94 he said proudly, pointing to the golden mask at the back of the room. \u8220\'93He guided you, all through your long life, so that you would be standing here. Here and now. He guided each one of you to this very challenge.\u8221\'94 He paused to let the weight of this obligation settle on proud shoulders. \u8220\'93You are not unlucky to be here,\u8221\'94 he continued. \u8220\'93Get rid of that feeling. You are lucky. Remember that very few get to meet evil with the clarity that you do now. How will you respond? Will you charge into this dark and kill whatever festers there? I will. Are you willing to die? I am. I will die with the luxury of knowing exactly what I\u8217\'92ll say to Solraheen when I meet Him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What will you say?\u8221\'94 Slate asked with excitement.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll say send me back, so that I can finish the job!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Slate encouraged a hurrah to percolate through through the ranks, and Pyetle swept this mild feeling up by drawing his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Think of your name being nailed to the head of a demon as children parade it down the Whiteway!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Think of the women!\u8221\'94 Blank shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The meaty women!\u8221\'94 Pyetle repeated to a swell of heartier cheers. And with their courage half-gathered, Pyetle marched into a dark passage that was barely there in the distant end of the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was forced to trudge along. He did not share in the Hrks excited visions of the afterlife. It was almost like they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d all completely forgotten that they\u8217\'92d just seen a Spark dissolve into dust.}}
