\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 y dearly loved friend, Charles Lamb, wrote, in his \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Essays of Elia,\u8221\'94 \u8220\'93I have an almost feminine partiality for old china. When I go to see any great house, I inquire first for the china-closet, and next for the picture-gallery. I have no repugnance for those little lawless azure-tinted grotesques that, under the notion of men and women, float about uncircumscribed by any element, in that world before perspective\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a china teacup.\u8221\'94 In that partiality for old china I humbly join, and it is of the search through New England for such dear old china loves, and of the gathered treasures of those happy china hunts, that I write.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 China hunting is a true \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93midsummer madness.\u8221\'94 When grass grows green and \u8220\'93daffodils begin to peer\u8221\'94\~}{\f0\fs24\b0 2}{\f0\fs24\b0 my fancy lightly turns to thoughts of china. Hot waxes the fever as crawls up the summer sun; fierce and fiercer rages the passion and the hunt, till autumn touches with her cold though glorious hand the trees and fields. Then doth my madness wane, and chase grow dull, and icy winter finds me sane and calm, till charming spring returns to witch me to \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93mine old lunes\u8221\'94 once again. Thus is every china captive of that mad summer chase aglow to me with summer suns and beauty\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 not a dull lifeless clod of moulded painted clay, but a glorious idealized token of long warm halcyon days too quickly passed, of \u8220\'93yesterdays that look backward with a smile.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Were the possession of old or valuable specimens of porcelain and pottery, or even of happy memories of \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93days of joyance,\u8221\'94 the only good things which came from the long hours of country ranging and farm-house searching spent in our china quests, Philistines might perhaps scoff at the waste of time and energy; but much else that is good have I found. Insight into human nature, love of my native country, knowledge of her natural beauties, acquaintance with her old landmarks and historical localities, familiarity with her history, admiration of her noble military and naval heroes, and study of the ancient manners, customs, and traditions of her early inhabitants have all been fostered, strengthened, and indeed almost brought into existence by the search after and study of old china. How vague and dull were my school-day history-lesson memories of Perry, of Lawrence, of Decatur, until I saw their likenesses\~}{\f0\fs24\b0 3}{\f0\fs24\b0 on some hideous Liverpool pitchers! then I read eagerly every word of history, every old song and ballad about them. How small was my knowledge of old \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93table manners\u8221\'94 and table furnishings until I discovered, through my china studies, how our ancestors ate and served their daily meals! How little I knew of the shy romance and the deep-lying though sombre sentiment in New England country life, until it was revealed to me in the tradition of many a piece of old china. How entirely powerless was I to discover the story of human nature as told in the countenance until my inquiries after old china made me a second Lavater in regarding the possibilities of successful purchase in case the questioned one chanced to own any old porcelain heirlooms! How few of our noble wood and valley roads had I seen until I drove through them searching for old farm-houses that might contain some salvage of teacups or teapots! And not only do we learn of America through our china hunts, but of England as well; for nearly all of our old table-ware was English, and the history of the production of English china can be traced as easily in New England as in old England. Few of the more costly pieces came here, but humbler specimens show equally well the general progress of the manufacture.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Let me be just and honest in my tale; though all is ideal happiness in the hours of the china chase, the counting of the spoils is sometimes vastly disappointing.}
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 There is no hobby of so uncertain gait, none other fancy in the pursuit of which one meets with so many rebuffs as in china collecting. I mean in real china collecting by individual search and pursuit, not in china buying at high prices at a fashionable china-shop. For such Cr\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u339\'9Csus buyers, who know not the sweet nor the bitter of true china hunting, these pages are not written.}{ }
