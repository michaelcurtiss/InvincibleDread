His vision was flooded with a cosmic swirl of shimmering brightness, and when Mandri shucked his mind free of this blinding vision, he could see everyone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Sparks stirring in their stomachs. Obo\u8217\'92s gold Spark outshone them all, but bright as he was, bright as they all were, they illuminated nothing.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His calm delivery belied the fact that his frustration was boiling over. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She wasn\u8217\'92t supposed to die!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then how did Mandri manage it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The tension in Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders snapped, and he stammered out a meek, \u8220\'93I have no idea.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri snickered and gathered himself together. He picked up Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter and carried it over to the Mazid, then patted him on the shoulder. \u8220\'93Let me carry you for another while,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s go find another enemy to burn.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo smiled and climbed into the litter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about you two?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked the siblings. \u8220\'93Are you coming?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Coming where?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sure Shis can\u8217\'92t be far away. There\u8217\'92s got to be a demon hole in the ground around here somewhere. Come on, what else are you going to do? This is what you\u8217\'92re here for, right? Ending evil? Well, let\u8217\'92s end it.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moteah eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do we do now?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri was dismayed to see his thread of purpose knot up at the base of the door. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I think I just stand here and\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Knock?\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri reached out to knock, but there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a clean spot for it. The door\u8217\'92s panel was too full of sculpted, snarling demons. In the end he made no decision, as a thread of purpose alighted out of nothing to guide his knuckles toward the forehead of an anguished man who was being yanked along by hooks set into his skin.}

\par\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He did not wait long, for out of the air around him there arose a voice, a woman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice, a voice as old and aggrieved as Elrahet\u8217\'92s.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come in,\u8221\'94 it said, and it was}
