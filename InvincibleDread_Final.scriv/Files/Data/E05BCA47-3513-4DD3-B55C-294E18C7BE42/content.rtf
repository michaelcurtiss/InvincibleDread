\pard\plain \fi720\sl288\slmult1\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His calm delivery belied the fact that his frustration was boiling over. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She wasn\u8217\'92t supposed to die!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then how did Mandri manage it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The tension in Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders snapped, and he stammered out a meek, \u8220\'93I have no idea.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri snickered and gathered himself together. He picked up Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter and carried it over to the Mazid, then patted him on the shoulder. \u8220\'93Let me carry you for another while,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s go find another enemy to burn.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Obo smiled and climbed into the litter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about you two?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked the siblings. \u8220\'93Are you coming?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Coming where?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sure Shis can\u8217\'92t be far away. There\u8217\'92s got to be a demon hole in the ground around here somewhere. Come on, what else are you going to do? This is what you\u8217\'92re here for, right? Ending evil? Well, let\u8217\'92s end it.\u8221\'94}}
