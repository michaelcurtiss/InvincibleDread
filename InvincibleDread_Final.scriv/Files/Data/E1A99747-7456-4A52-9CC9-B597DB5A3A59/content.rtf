\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 We are model making organisms. We are not climbing around the jungle gym of reality, we are climbing around our own models. ALL knowledge is couched inside our models. So, fundamentally, we cannot \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91know\u8217\'92 anything about reality. What we can do is observe reality and make determinations to the extent that our models correspond to these observations.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But even this aspect of quantification is become a problem. Quantification is a boundary defining issue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And this is the problem with models - coarse graining is fundamentally a boundary making operation. It defines boundaries in which none exist.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Philosophy is an attempt to find the ontological boundaries which *must* be there at the depths of reality. See Plato\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s forms - probe reality to find the perfect form it is an emanation of. Or Kant\u8217\'92s categories. Mysticism is a push in the opposite direction, a push towards denying the existence of any such boundaries, an assertion of a Whole, a pleroma.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But notice that we are already philosophizing. We have defined a boundary between Philosophy and Mysticism. It is fundamentally impossible to speak intelligibly without drawing boundaries, i.e. it is impossible for the speaking mind to not be a philosopher and \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91model-make\u8217\'92 the world. This is why the mystic seeks to quiet the mind, to flee from knowledge and knowledge making by entrancing oneself in meditation, so that all boundaries melt away. To achieve oneness with the divine, a mind must abandon knowledge and embrace unknowing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then comes the question of whether or not the ecstatic mystical experience is actually achieving anything more than reduction to a base state that then gets interpreted as \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91unification with the divine truth\u8217\'92. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 So this is the central tension between mysticism and philosophy - mysticism posits unity, philosophy posits multiplicity. Nothing can be said about unity, because to speak on it would require defining boundaries which do not exist. In contrast, an infinite number of philosophical statements could be uttered, for it is all fundamentally artificial; even if it does correspond with reality (see infinite possiblity space of models/hill climbing).}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The modern mind is one which suspects a fundamental unity that gives rise to a multiplicity\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85somehow. (Wolfram ruliad). It tries to uncover the unity via multiplicative language. Is that even possible?}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Whatever the case, there is this tension, and assuming that this tension is intensional by God, why? For what purpose? Why define a reality which is fundamentally inaccessible to created beings? Is it curiosity about what kind of models get created? Is beauty a function of ignorance/inaccuracy, and so he wishes to see our ignorance on display in the models we create? Is our model creating behavior fulfilling some kind of function a \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91la Teilhard\u8217\'92s Omega Point? }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It is beautiful, in a way, the particular historic context which defines the line of intellectual thought is striking and wonderfully unique in a truly awesome way. It is so very fascinating. But is fascinating the reason for that tension?}
