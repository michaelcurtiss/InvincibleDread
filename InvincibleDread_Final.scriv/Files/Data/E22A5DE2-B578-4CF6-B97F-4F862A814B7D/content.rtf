\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated her. Mandri slipped on a spot of Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated her\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Seb was the sole exception to this alternating}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto was dragging them into the pits of exasperation.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see your sword.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri fumbled at his sword\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hilt. As he pulled it out he dropped it. It clanged on the stone floor, and in this cavernous hall the noise was magnified to a peal of thunder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Moto clenched his jaw tight and his eyes accused Mandri of dropping the sword on purpose. Then he lowered his torch to the blade and studied the sheen of light playing upon it. He was looking for signs of use.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  At pace, they reached the end of the hall unmolested, and uplifted there, on a narrow set of stairs, was a red sandstone throne.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The throne\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s seat and arms were featureless, fashioned from natural river-smoothed stone, while its back was a billowing slab carved to look like flame licked into a curl by an unseen wind. Etched into the wall behind was a ring of faces, faces inside of faces, much like the temple\u8217\'92s exterior\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 howling animals, untamed men, as well as snarling demons.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She\u8217\'92ll choose the stairs,\u8221\'94 said a grunt at the back of the crowd. He was a skinny, sickly type, with sunken eyes and fear-stricken demeanor, probably the weakest looking man to ever don the Skulsi cloak. He spoke in a hushed tone to the fellow nearest, who was none other than the Skulsi with the scarred forehead. This one was frowning deeply.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Temples go up, not down,\u8221\'94 the scarred man said, clearly upset with the idea that this temple had been built upside down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, it\u8217\'92ll be down,\u8221\'94 said the fearful one. \u8220\'93Where else would a big demon sleep if not underneath the mountain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scarred man shrugged, then noticed Mandri out the corner of his eye and the lines in his forehead twisted into an angry knot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where you been!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He grabbed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hair, yanked downwards, then pulled Mandri\u8217\'92s whole gangly mass so close that their noses nearly kissed. It was then that Mandri began to wonder if this man really was an erstwhile Solitant\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 s}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He eyed Mandri with a fuming anger that might have exploded if Elrahet hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t decided on a path to follow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I knew it\u8217\'92d be down,\u8221\'94 said the fearful Hrk as he watched Elrahet descend into the dark. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s always down.\u8221\'94}

\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was a growing tension in his chest, though he suspected that was more Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s doing. He glimpsed her only once amidst the stream of white cloaks between them. She just so happened to be staring right back at him. Her hand was gripping his heart tightly now. Her fingers squeezed as the hallway squeezed.}}
