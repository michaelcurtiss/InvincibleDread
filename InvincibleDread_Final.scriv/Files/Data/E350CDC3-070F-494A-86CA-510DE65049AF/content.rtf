\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Intellectual conversation, whether grave or humorous, is only fit for intellectual society; it is downright abhorrent to ordinary people, to please whom it is absolutely necessary to be commonplace and dull. This demands an act of sever self-denial; we have to forfeit three-fourths of ourselves in order to become like other people.}

Their mind is wanting in elasticity; it has no movement of its own. And so they try to give it some, by drink, for instance. How much drunkeness is due to this cause alone!}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Men of great intellect live in the world without really belonging to it; and so, from tehir earliest years, they feel that there is a perceptible difference between them and other people. But it is only gradually, with the lapse of years, that they come to a clear understanding fo their position.}

\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {. Thus reading forces on the mind ideas that are as foreign and heterogeneous to the tendency and mood it has at the moment, as is the seal to the wax whereon it impresses its stamp. Thus the mind is totally compelled from without to think first of one thing and then of another, for which it has absolutely no inclination or disposition. When, on the other hand, a man thinks for himself, his mind follows its own natural impulse, as this has been more specifically determined for the moment either by external environment or by some recollection. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Therefore the mind is deprived of all its elasticity by much reading as is a spring when a weight is continually applied to it; and the surest way not to have thoughts of our own is for us at once to take up a book when we have a moment to spare. This practice is the reason why erudition makes most men more stupid and simple than they are by nature and also deprives their literary careers of every success.* As Pope says, they remain: For ever reading, never to be read. The Dunciad, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u1096\'3F. 193-4. }

\par\plain {Scholars are those who have read in books, but thinkers, men of genius, world-enlighteners, and reformers of the human race are those who have read directly in the book of the world. [* Those who write are so numerous, those who think so rare.] }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Even if occasionally we had been able very easily and conveniently to find in a book a truth or view which we very laboriously and slowly discovered through our own thinking and combining, it is nevertheless a hundred times more valuable if we have arrived at it through our own original thinking. Only then does it enter into the whole system of our ideas as an integral part and living member; only then is it completely and firmly connected therewith, is understood in all its grounds and consequents, bears the colour, tone, and stamp of our whole mode of thought, has come at the very time when the need for it was keen, is therefore firmly established and cannot again pass away. Accordingly, Goethe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s verse here finds its most perfect application and even explanation: What from your fathers\u8217\'92 heritage is lent, Earn it anew, really to possess it!}

\par\plain {Reading is equivalent to thinking with someone else\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head instead of with one\u8217\'92s own. Now for our own thinking, whence a coherent and connected whole, a system though not strictly rounded off, endeavours to evolve, nothing is more detrimental than too strong an influx of other people\u8217\'92s ideas through constant reading. For each of them has sprung from the mind of another, belongs to another system, bears another tint; and never do they flow of themselves into a totality of thought, knowledge, insight, and conviction. On the contrary, they set up in the head a slight Babylonian confusion of tongues, and a mind so crammed is now robbed of all clear insight and thus is wellnigh disorganized. This state can be observed in many scholars and results in their being inferior to many illiterate men as regards common sense, correct judgement, and practical tact. The latter have always subordinated to, and incorporated in, their own thinking the little knowledge that has come to them from without through experience, conversation, and a little reading }

\par\plain {g. Now it is just this that the scientific thinker also does to a greater degree. Although he needs much knowledge and must, therefore, read a great deal, his mind is nevertheless strong enough to master all this, to assimilate it, to incorporate it into his system of ideas, and thus to subordinate it to the organically consistent totality of his vast and ever-growing insight. Here his own thinking, like the ground-bass of an organ, always dominates everything and is never drowned by the notes and tones of others, as is the case with the minds of mere pundits and polyhistors, where fragments of music in all keys run into one another, so to speak, and the fundamental note can no longer be detected at all. }

\par\plain {According to these observations, it will not surprise us to learn that the man who is capable of thinking for himself and the book-philosopher can easily be recognized even by their style of delivery; the former by the stamp of earnestness, directness, and originality, by all his ideas and expressions that spring from his own perception of things; the latter, on the other hand, by the fact that everything is second-hand, consists of traditional notions, trash and rubbish, and is flat and dull, like the impression of an impression. His style, consisting of conventional, and even banal, phrases and current new-fangled words, resembles a small state whose circulation consists of none but foreign coins because it does not mint any of its own. }

\par\plain {siveness and clearness; and in this respect they can be at once recognized. The characteristic sign of all first-rate minds is the directness of all their judgements and opinions. All that they express and assert is the result of their own original thinking and everywhere proclaims itself as such even by the style of delivery. Accordingly, like princes, they have an imperial immediacy in the realm of the mind; the rest are all mediatized, as is already seen from their style which has no stamp of originality. Therefore every genuine and original thinker is to this extent like a monarch; he is immediate and perceives no one who is his superior. Like the decrees of a monarch, his judgements spring from his own supreme power and come directly from himself. For he no more accepts authorities than does the monarch take orders; on the contrary, he admits nothing but what he himself has confirmed. On the other hand, minds of the common ruck who labour under all kinds of current opinions, authorities, and prejudices, are like the crowd which silently obeys laws and orders. }

\par\plain {The problem of existence is very great and very close to us; this existence that is dubious, questionable, tormented, fleeting, and dream-like. It is so great and so near that, the moment we become aware of it, it overshadows and hides all other problems and purposes. Now in this connection, we see how all men, with few and rare exceptions, are not clearly conscious of the problem; in fact, they do not appear to have grasped it at all, but are much more concerned about everything else. They live for the day and think only of the scarcely longer span of their personal future, for either they expressly decline to consider the problem, or else, with regard thereto, they willingly make a compromise through some system of popular metaphysics with which they are satisfied. If we carefully consider all this, we may form the opinion that only in a much wider sense can man be called a thinking being; and then we shall not be very surprised at any trait of thoughtlessness or simplicity. On the contrary, we shall realize that the intellectual horizon of the normal man transcends, it is true, that of the animal which is unaware of the future and the past and whose existence is, so to speak, a single present. But we shall also realize that the human mental horizon is not so incalculably far removed from the animal\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s as is generally assumed. It is in accordance with the foregoing that, even in conversation, we find the thoughts of most people to be clipped as short as chopped straw, so that out of them a longer thread cannot be spun. }
\par\plain {If this world were populated with really thinking beings, it would be impossible for all kinds of noise to be permitted and given such unlimited scope, even the most terrible and purposeless. But if nature had intended man for thinking, she would not have given him ears, or at any rate would have furnished them with air-tight flaps, as with bats whom for this reason I envy. But like the rest, man is really a poor animal whose powers are calculated merely for the maintenance of his existence. For this reason, he needs ears which are always open and, even unasked, announce the approach of a pursuer both by night and by day. }
