\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram paused a few yards outside the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gate, forcing the scribe to cross the greater distance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When the horse and rider finally neared the giant, Ayram laid down his spear. And though the scribe was high in his a saddle, they met almost eye to eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you Greskal?\u8221\'94 The rider asked, impressed at Ayram\u8217\'92s size.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram glanced behind him and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This tower has no master. As you can see, it is empty, save for me and mine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The stern man said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We know that the Mazidobo resides in this tower.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So it does,\u8221\'94 said Ayram. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then bring it forth. I wish to speak with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can speak with me,\u8221\'94 said Ayram gruffly. \u8220\'93I will pass your message along.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe frowned. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is not the time for games,\u8221\'94 he warned. \u8220\'93We found the body of the Mazidariga of Shuls out in the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me, has the Mazidobo lost its flame? We saw no scorch marks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are welcome to test that interpretation, should you wish.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe sneered and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We know the Mazidobo has acquired some means of reversing the Mazidariga\u8217\'92s charm. We know that it escaped the leash of his Minder. We wish to come to terms with it, so as to avoid any further loss of life.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s horse was growing more perturbed by the moment. Its eyes were wide and its nostrils flared and it kept trying to resettle its rider, as if preparing to bolt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell the Mazidobo, that as we speak, a battalion of Hrkan Skulsi marches into the eastern mouth of the Goree Pass. At their head is the Mazidurn. Behind me, as you can see, is a column of swords, and coming up from the south, from the Solgi, is the Mazidban, who shall be with us shortly. As such, you are all surrounded, and should it come to it, you }{\f5\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 will}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  be overwhelmed. There is no way out excepting the event in which you and yours peaceably disarm yourselves, and the Mazidobo offers itself up into my charge. In exchange, all lives will all be spared, and the Mazidobo shall be allowed to retire from service after submitting to examination. We do not need violence here, nor do we want it. More than anything, we want the Mazidobo alive, for we wish to learn from its malfunction.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t much like those terms,\u8221\'94 Ayram said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe frowned and his horse bucked slightly, sharing its rider\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s frustration.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is not a matter for you to decide,\u8221\'94 the scribe said. \u8220\'93Bring my terms to the Mazidobo, or bring the Mazidobo and I\u8217\'92ll tell it myself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Ayram stroked his beard. He looked up at the sky, arced his shoulders, and he drew in a breath that could fill an ox\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach, enough air to think for a good long while. In the intervening silence, the scribe\u8217\'92s horse began to clip-clop its agitation, bouncing the scribe uncomfortably in his saddle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Settled down you crooked beast!\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An unleashed Mazid would be no good for any of us. But if it will only speak to a Mazid, then we will have to wait, for the Mazidban will not be here for at least another hand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The scribe bit his lip in frustration. He looked up, took in the tower, then spied the long distance behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93But I won\u8217\'92t do this business in the shadow of this accursed place. We\u8217\'92ll meet where the tower\u8217\'92s shadow meets the light of Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 With the sun approaching its noontime zenith, the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow extended out into the desert a mere forty yards or so.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fair enough,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
