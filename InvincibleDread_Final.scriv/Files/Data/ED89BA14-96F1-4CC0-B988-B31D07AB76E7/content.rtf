Or at least, if anyone did speak, Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t aware of it. All his senses were far away. He could not feel his toes squeeze inside his shoes. His palm did not tingle when he braced himself against cold stone. His legs moved without any strain or weight. Even his breathing felt like someone else\u8217\'92s. It took tremendous effort to reassert his Self and swivel his eyes down to study the iridescent threads of purpose which guided him through the dark. It was so much effort that he did it once and never again. He was not in control, so it did not matter much if he saw where he was going.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A sense of suspicion followed him. It was coming from his companions, from the way they gripped their weapons a little too tightly, from how they walked a little too close behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Perhaps he was imagining their alertness and attention.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d often project his own paranoia upon others while plunging the depths of a burgeon binge. This became a little clearer when he began to suspect that the rock itself was shaming him. Jagged streaks of feldspar were trying to convince him he didn\u8217\'92t belong. Little mounds of pebbles seemed to shy away from his approach. Then he came upon a small, shit-stained tunnel that some pregnant beast of a lizard had hewn. It was just his size. Unlike everything else, it was welcoming. He belly crawled into it, and after his body struggled a while, he emerged into the desert night.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The twinkling sky was a magnificent blue. The clean air was invigorating. He stood up, brushed off the grit which clung to his sleeves and knees, and then he closed his eyes and took a deep, neck-stretched breath. Here he caught a glimpse of the soreness that wrecked his body. It would have bulled him over if he weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t dwelling in his own periphery. Then he opened his eyes and found himself standing atop a plateau in the Goree mountains. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d come a long distance without realizing it. To the south he spied Shulgi\u8217\'92s silhouette set against the blue of night. He could blot it out with his thumb. To the west, the sand blanketed world. The Tib blacked the rim of the horizon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Out of the way,\u8221\'94 Moto grumbled as he pulled himself out of the lizard hole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Moto was all the way out and standing, he took a deep breath, just as Mandri had done.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll light a fire,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Long stalks of woody haggas weed grew out of stone-cracks nearby, and Moto gathered these while Moteah pulled herself out through the hole. She was more wary of Mandri, sort of kept close to him and watched him. Mandri wanted to laugh at the tension, but somehow, he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t. He simply stood there, staring at her Spark like a freak. Then he watched Pyetle wiggle out of the hole. Last was Ayram. It was a struggle for him to fit through. By the time he was out, Moto a respectable little fire going, having lucked into a few twisted bone-dry branches that were strewn about.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He permitted them all to sit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah retrieved from her robes two small bricks of cappash\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a dried and minced lizard meat spiced with bitter herbs and caked in yellowed fat. She handed one of these to Mandri. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look like you need it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Whatever force controlling Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body accepted the offering. He nibbled on a corner, thinking there\u8217\'92d be no taste. At first there wasn\u8217\'92t, but with the second chew the meat\u8217\'92s smoky flavor percolated into being. Somehow the act of eating was pulling him back into his own skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t entirely enjoyable.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Every swallow slumped him further into his body\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s exhaustion. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol\u8217\'92s light, I\u8217\'92m tired,\u8221\'94 he mumbled between mouthfuls. \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suppose we could take some time to sleep?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No sleep,\u8221\'94 said Ayram, who wasn\u8217\'92t eating anything. He was sitting cross-legged, appreciating the fire between them. His great spear was stuck into the stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We need to talk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri licked his teeth and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle sat to his left. The siblings, to his right. They all watched with fascination as Ayram raised Pel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach up by the entrails.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol\u8217\'92s own shadow offered you this,\u8221\'94 he said to Mandri. \u8220\'93Do you know why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri shook his head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She also named you the Burshageet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram paused to let the accusation breathe, because now that it was out the air it was its own kind of beast. It had horns. It to be dealt with.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I understand how you feel,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, or rather, seemed to say. The sound of his voice was so distant that he wasn\u8217\'92t exactly sure what his words were.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lips drew tight and he nodded. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was not so composed. He had his hands up to frame the significance of his meaning. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This could be it! That stomach could be the last vestige of Schisol on this earth. \u8220\'93Toss it into the fire, and we\u8217\'92re done.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stared at Moto for a moment, then tossed the Sparked stomach into the fire.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The organ bounced of the top log and rolled onto a crook of flame. It squizzled and spurted. Smoke poured out of the severed ends. The Spark inside seemed energized by the flames, but after a finger or so, it all settled down. It almost looked cozy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I suspect,\u8221\'94 Ayram said, eyes narrowed, \u8220\'93that it is no easy thing to destroy. Even if we could, the Spark inside would, in time, find its way back into another.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How did Greskal\u8217\'92s prince destroy his Spark?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everyone who would know is dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This whole time Pyetle had been leering at Mandri. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d bet Mandri could destroy it,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram picked up his iron spear and poked the stomach back out of the fire. It rolled towards Mandri, collecting a speckled film of dirt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Its Spark looked similar to his own.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His stomach growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And look, there was a rather elegant thread of purpose connecting that beautiful light to his lips. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He pulled back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He remembered that he still had Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s knife so he took it out. Now he was confronted with a decision: Should he cut that thread?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Was such a thing even possible?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen Elrahet and Pel cut threads, so in theory it was possible, but could }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 he}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  do it? This question went beyond the simple matter of his muscles driving his skeleton to cut, it was a matter of intention, because he noticed another thread, this one stuck to his knife. That meant two different futures were outlined here, one in which he ate, and one in which he cut. Which was his decision? What if he wanted to cut both of these futures out of existence, or did that require another knife, and another thread of fate? Could that third-order thread be cut? Was there ever room for }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 him}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  in this situation? Which thread was he laying down? And what about these thoughts? Perhaps even these thoughts were being drawn along a predictable curve. Indeed, he could almost see his feelings being carted around by bright white lines of purpose. He was not himself. It was not Mandrameen who watched that single Black knife splay out into a circular fan of knives. Someone else saw those vibrating blades turn to cut their neighbor\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s threads, an infinite regress of effects putting an end to their own infinite regress of causes. Only, they didn\u8217\'92t cut. Each knife\u8217\'92s edge slipped past their neighbor\u8217\'92s thread to bend impossibly back around so as to cut their own, a recursive swirl of instrumentality meant to sever the very notion fate itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach lurched. His vision froze up. Just as he began to suspect that he\u8217\'92d somehow struck down time, he heard a voice. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93STOP!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His whole world twisted around as his mind flashed back into his body. Sprang through his eyes, and there was Pel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach pushed into his mouth by his own cupped hands. His teeth were sinking into its hot . He could feel the on his tongue as his molars had pierced the lining. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A shadow passed over the fire, and suddenly there was Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s massive sillhouette blocking the light. He had his spear an inch away from Mandri\u8217\'92s forehead. Moto was standing there beside him, sword drawn. Moteah was behind and between them both. Her handless arm was outstretched, squeezing his heart.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Spit it out,\u8221\'94 she commanded. Her forceful words twanged the tendons in his neck and he spat it out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Give it here,\u8221\'94 Ayram said with an outstretched hand. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri could not move, so Ayram reached down and took the stomach. He pondered it for a moment, saw teeth marks. He gave a little snort and shook his head, then turned away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re just gonna sit back down!?\u8221\'94 Moto cried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am,\u8221\'94 Ayram declared, and he sat right back down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But he is the Burshageet!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s calm down,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said, still a little ruffled from the excitment. He tried to stabilize the mood by pressing the air down with open hands.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was wise to these gestural affectations.  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Calm down?\u8221\'94 he said, incredulous. \u8220\'93Look at him! He was about to eat that stomach raw!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but he didn\u8217\'92t. The girl held him back.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you people insane!? We need to kill him!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94 Moteah said. \u8220\'93The Burshageet is dead. Besides, Elrahet saw this end. She chose this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t know that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah rolled her eyes and found her seat again. Pyetle sat down as well, a little more wary of Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s heightened mood. Moto looked at them all with ___, like their silence was talking over him. That he was the only one still standing was somehow a challenge to the core his being.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about the Schisol\u8217\'92s shadow? That evil witch could read the future, too. Why would she kill herself? I\u8217\'92ll tell you why\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she\u8217\'92d do it if her victory was assured}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 . }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d do it if she knew that }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 he }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 was going to finish her job!\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle chuckled. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now who\u8217\'92s speaking on what they can\u8217\'92t possibly know?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How else would you explain this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe the old witch knew she could not defeat Mandri. Her only chance, then, was to try and corrupt him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is already corrupted.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She might have thought her army would overcome him. Maybe she wasn\u8217\'92t a very good seer. Or think of this, \u8221\'94 Pyetle said as he leaned forward, getting more interested in his own argument. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen two bulls locked in the same field fight for an entire summer. One day they grew tired of it. Now, you\u8217\'92ve said these two witches have been fighting each other for\u8230\'85for however long. A thousand years? More? At that point, do they care who wins or loses? I can see them simply deciding to let things fall where they may.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto scoffed at this suggestion. As did Ayram. Both men that their gave them authority to suggest that it was a stupid thing to say. Now that the odds were against Pyetle, he adopted pious airs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have faith that Solraheen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen is dead,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled. \u8220\'93He has nothing to do with this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why does Mandri bear His fire? You all watched him turn back the very hordes of Shis, and you want to murder him for it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His question hung in the air unanswered for a moment, but Moto was able to sneer his way through this complication. He swipe-flicked his blade through the air to remember its weight before setting its edge to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Give me a reason not to kill you,\u8221\'94 he snarled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stared into the soft glow of Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Spark, then said, \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t need to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, you do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t, because you\u8217\'92re not going to kill me. Not tonight. Perhaps tomorrow. I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sneer deepened. It seemed for a moment that he really might strike, but there was a thin thread of purpose drawing his sword away. This did not mean that he did not want to do it. It was clear from his unwavering gaze and firmly planted feet that he did.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah was standing beside him now, pawing at his shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if killing Mandri is what evil desires? What if that witch called him the Burshageet just to get you riled up so that you would kill him?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mouth twisted up. He was unaccustomed to weight of entertaining counterfactuals. But the logic was brutal\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 if he were to kill Mandri, then he might save or doom the world in equal measure. Or, Mandri could be of no consequence at all. There was no way for him to know.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He finally lowered his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stepped back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He sat down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The rest of that night, they all watched the fire burn down to ash. There was a little conversation about what Pyetle was going to do, how he was going to carry news of these events back to Jeket. Pyetle wanted to take Mandri with him. Ayram was firmly against this, but he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t for anything else.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto brooded, stared at his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah kept trying to solicit Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s opinion on what he wanted to do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All the while Mandri smiled, because it was such an incredible thing to mean such different things to different people.}}
