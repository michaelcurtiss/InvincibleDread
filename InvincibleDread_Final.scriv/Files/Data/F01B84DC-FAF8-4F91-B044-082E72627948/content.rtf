\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 While the novices waited in an adjoining room, the brothers assembled in the ceremonial room of the lodge. The Master took his place at the front of the room beneath the baldachin flanked on either side by two Knights wearing white robes and helmets adorned with horns and leaning on their swords. In front of these sat the Treasurer and Secretary wearing white masonic sashes, while the Herald took up his position in the centre of the room. At the back of the room in the grove of the Grail stood the Bard in a white gown, before him the master of Ceremonies in a blue gown, while the other lodge brothers stood in a semicircle around him as far as the tables of the Treasurer and Secretary. Behind the move of the " Grail was a music room where a harmonium and piano were accompanied by a small choir of 'forest elves'.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The ceremony began with soft harmonium music, while the brothers sang the Pilgrims' Chorus from Wagner's Tannhauser. The ritual commenced in candlelight with brothers making the sign of the swastika and the Master reciprocating. Then the blindfolded novices, clad in pilgrimage mantles, were ushered by the Master of Ceremonies into the room. Here the Master told them of the Order's Ario-Germanic and aristocratic Weltanschauung, before the Bard lit the sacred flame in the grove and the novices were divested of their mantles and blindfolds. At this point the Master seized Wotan's spear and held it before him, while the two Knights crossed their swords upon it. A series of calls and responses, accompanied by music from Wagner, completed the oath of the novices. Their consecration followed with cries from the 'forest elves' as the new brothers were led into the grove of the Grail around the Bard's sacred flame.?' With the ritual personifying lodge officers as archetypal figures in Germanic mythology, this ceremonial must have exercised a potent influence on the candidates.}

\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I'm from Baltimore. All 37 yrs of my life. I watched em film the wire. It was huge here. Here's some things. Just to show how GOD AWFUL THE PPL RUNNING OUR CITY R! THEIR SCUM! And how bad it is here. Saw my first murder when I was 13. Grown man shot a teen for a bike. Saw a woman get shot up at a red light for not dancing with a guy at the club. He followed her and shot her. A group of 13 yr olds broke into my neighbors house and raped her 14 yr old granddaughter, killed her and burned the house down. Google that one, eastern parkway Hamilton MD. A woman got shot in the head and killed on my street for not giving dude a cigarette. I had a guy hop in my car and put a gun to me and made me drive him around to dof places while his eyes rolled around in his head high af. At one point made me pull behind an abandoned house and put the gun to my head and I literally thought, will I feel the bullet go through my head or is it immediate nothingness. Had a guy stabbed in the hood of my car at a red light. Saw a dead body on Moravia by the grave yard McNulty meets Omar at. I saw a shooting at McDonald's around there too and driving home I saw the teen with his head hanging off the stretcher and a big ass exit wound in the back of his head while his mother sat there screaming. My friend got shot on my street while walking his 5 yr old daughter and does In front of her. My other friend got killed the same way. I did time where they had Omar (not a lot but being white there isn't easy) and my cell mate got rushed and stabbed up and I had to just keep reading and act like nothing was happening. Those r off the top of the head. Heres some shit on the gov and how they run it. Each street has more abandoned houses then not. Drugs r literally as easy to get as the show shows. They ran the port to shit, destroyed the schools, embezzled SOOOO MANY TIMES!!! The past 3 mayor's have gotten locked up, the bridge and tunnel money embezzled, they refunded the police!!!! They for instance took 2 million to put ac in the schools. Then the gov said 2 yrs later, where's the ac and couldn't find it. Then tried to pass a law that said to spend school money u need multiple layers of ppl to sign off and watch, the mayor got everyone pissed off by saying the white gov was gonna make it to where they couldn't help black kids and horde the money. They protested and rioted. So no go. Next year another million went missing. They said let us put casinos in Baltimore and the profits will help the schools. Never happened. Then the casinos needed money to save em and they said this time we promise a share of the profits will help the schools. Guess what. Never fucking did! They now r getting caught doing dirty shit with funding for the destroyed key bridge. We had a city that had marble steps at every home and now look at it. The police were so dirty in places they were robbing drug dealers and slinging that shit and then when one was gonna testify he gets shot with his own fucking weapon and no leads ever got. The one homicide detective in the show (last name Norris I believe it's been a while) was a real homicide detective and became our upper guy, he got fucked so hard for doing his job that he became a radio show host all about exposing these fucks. The gov knocked up a news anchor and then she disappears. They have voted blue for 70 years now and it's literally destroyed the city. Not saying red would save it but when one group gets to run unchecked this long they get dug in. They rig shit and destroy shit. They're pure evil. And again, THEY DEFUNDED THE POLICE HERE!!! It's sooooo much worse now then this show portrayed now! It's bad. Really bad. I went to the inner harbor for the fourth of July once, if they took a picture of the whole harbor and u looked, me and my two friends would be the 3 white ppl off to the side, they started jumping cops and stealing their guns. We got robbed 4 times that night and once at gun point. But after the first time, what can u give? Every step we took someone asks if u want crack or dope and after a while u stop answering. Wrong. Then they get mad and try and fight or rob u. Dope is so bad here that I lost at least 19 friends to it. 4 close good friends. Gone for ever. Becca, Justin, John, Keith, Jessica, Matt, another Matt, Shane, rex, ally, cuda, Nikki, rell, black, Ashley, Brandon, Alex, tommy and more. All, well most were amazing nice ppl just stuck. Doctors sold us prescriptions of perks oxys and Xanax for 200 bucks. We were 17 and 5 of us go to the pharmacy and each get perk 30s, oxy 80s and Xanax (why tf would we need oxy 80s?! That's cancer type ish) and then they just busy the doctors, close down shop and no extra rehabs or help. So yea, we turned to heroin. I been clean 14 yrs now. But still, can't even let my daughter outside. And hearing gunshots is extremely normal. Extremely. I went on a rant here I know. But I get so angry when I see these politicians, upper police officers and others getting filthy rich and leaving us with NOTHING!!! THEY DESTROYED OUR BEAUTIFUL CITY AND ALLOWED MINORITES TO BASICALLY LIVE IN A 3RD WORLD!!! My beautiful black wife and mixed daughter are all I got. And we r getting out this ish hole. Soon. Wish I didn't have to but we have to. Being a white boy here is hard. Very hard. U know what it's like when in the winter, u enjoy it cause u can cover ur skin and hide. Hood up, hands in pockets, pants, mask and no one knows. Ur not preyed on. I got jumped once for sitting on a bus stop bench. They said it was a colored bench. Another two time just for being what I am. They say things like get that racist \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u55356\'3F\u57176\'3F and stomp u. School I know I was targeted cause of it. Ok I'm done. But yea. It's fucked up here. And ppl deserve PRISON FOR WHAT THEYVE DONE HERE!!!!}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And no, u can't blame crack for this shit. Things were allowed to get to this, because it's all part of the plan. Destroy minorites and who ever there with em by passive means. Can't burn crosses anymore or lynch so u encourage violence through lack of punishment, rap, movies and broken families, get ppl hooked on welfare and take it away if they do better, make the areas they live in broke and destroyed, destroy the schools, make areas so dangerous companies don't survive there taking jobs away and more. It's all part of their plane. Don't ask why. But when everywhere u rule minorities suffer and they're all ran the same exact way that causes it, I say it's not an accident or a side affect. It's on purpose. U can't go, woops, I accidentally keep destroying minorities everywhere I go. Smfh.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The above set up was conducted in the lab frame. We now couple our equipment to a layer of hexahydro-1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazine in order to rapidly impart a constant (within air-resistence) velocity to the equipment. When the layer was activated the velocity profile of the equipment was 250(80) m/s with respect to the lab frame (measured using radar doppler shift). In this reference frame the equipment recorded no events. Further more, once the equipment reached the extent of the lab, it encountered a boundary condition that returned it to the lab frame velocity profile. Curiously, the no-events-effect persisted even when returned to the lab frame. After 1 hour of observations an overall rate of 0(0) events per minute was recorded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This is a significant difference from the lab frame result. The result can not be explained by applying a Lorentz boost. I appreciate the need for repeat experiments to confirm this result. However, due to unforeseen circumstances I do not currently have access to the lab, so can not repeat the result at this time.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You see a code because that's how you view it, that's how you structure it. DNA is no more a code than the chemical reaction occurring in your stomach is. It's chemistry, pure and simple. The only reason these parts work as well as they do is because they're zipping around at 45mph in a less than 1mm space. They just keep bouncing around until, eventually, they find the right spot. This isn't some graceful, well orchestrated thing. DNA sucks, straight up. It fails, constantly. It operates mostly by chance. It continues, somehow. Life is beautiful in that way, but code is the wrong word for it, only used to give us as human beings some kind of structure to support it in our minds.}

However, ropes are a couple of inches or so, the so-called "Snyder length". Instead of needing galaxy sized particle accelerators to see them, we can use ordinary telescopes.It is no secret that Feynman in his later years was leaning towards repudiating QED.

A crisis in understanding is the price paid for autonomy, for making man the interpreter constitutive for meaning and revelation. Ours is a day when, as never before, man has become a question to himself. Man himself has become hermeneutically problematic, and his entire existence is conceived of as one great interpretative endeavor. In a world in which it is held that the only absolute is uncertainty, he searches for norms.}{\f2\fs24\b1\i0  From the aimless roll of time in which he is caught up he tries to wrest meaning.
