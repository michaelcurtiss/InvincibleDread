In the official report of the assassination it was said:}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Leonid Kannegiesser asserts that he killed Uritsky solely of his own free will, in revenge for the arrest of certain army officers, and for the execution of his friend Peretzweig, but in no case in obedience to orders from any political party or association.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 On August 28 another Socialist\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in this instance a Madame Kaplan\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 attempted similarly to assassinate Lenin.
