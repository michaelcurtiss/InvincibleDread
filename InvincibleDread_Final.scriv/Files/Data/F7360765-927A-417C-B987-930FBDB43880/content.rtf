\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 In an earlier answer to a similar question, which\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://www.reddit.com/u/Ecstatic_Pipe22"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0 u/Ecstatic_Pipe22{\f0\fs24\b0 \~}}}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~linked in his comment, I pointed out that military slaves (along with many other non-military people classified as the slaves of the Ottoman sultan) enjoyed a certain prestige in Ottoman society. Slave status was not necessarily degrading in and of itself. If one was the slave of a powerful person, then the enslaved person could enjoy some prestige from that connection, especially if their function within the powerful person's household brought them into close personal contact with their master. The upper crust of the Ottoman military elite all tried to portray themselves as the sultan's slaves, even if they were actually free, because doing so was a way of emphasizing their closeness to the all-powerful ruler. Prestigious as it was to be a powerful governor, it was even more so to be a governor who could claim to have once personally dressed the sultan in his robes, or held his stirrup, or carried his sword.}{ }}
