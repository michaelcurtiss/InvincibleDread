It is characterized by a hissing buzz at the edge of the conscious mind. The word is derived from the word eldruub, which is the name for the wild slosh of ocean foam that gets beached during a world storm. Such storms will blanket an entire coast in salty pale-brown spume, six feet of it, and so even as the storm departs the air is still alive as an uncountable number of bubbles pop. This hissing buzz is not loud, it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s simply there and it is everywhere. Days later, when the sound and sight of foam is gone, there comes again the sight of solid ground, a beach, though the shoreline is not the same as it once was for the storm has ravaged it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Mandrameen didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t notice hissing buzz of the Sheldruub. He didn\u8217\'92t notice the feeling of his own blood pumping through his veins and tickling his insides. He had no awareness that he had been brought back to life. He was afraid, and he was afraid because his first rekindled thought was that Salavan was dead, and so he must be dead, and thus, he had crossed the threshold into the afterlife.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He believed that he was a cold corpse floating in a void.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The signs were unmistakable.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His very bones were ice and his whole face was numb\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 if his face was there at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was the unmistakable putrescence of rotting flesh. Mandri knew the smell well because when he was a child, rats would die in the burrow underneath his floor and he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have to endure the smell. He couldn\u8217\'92t escape the smell by sleeping outside because if he did, gilt flies would get him. He\u8217\'92d tried it once, and when he woke, his whole left cheek was covered in blistering welts the size of fingernails. His right cheek had been nestled in his pillow, so with only his left cheek welted up, he looked like he\u8217\'92d been slapped in the face by disease.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The smell of rot was always upsetting, especially now, because, presumably, that smell was coming from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 And he could not move.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Dead things do not move, therefore, he was dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Yet, he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 could}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  breathe. His breath was warm coming out of his throat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He tried again to move. He wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure if he had legs or arms, for he couldn\u8217\'92t truly feel them\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there was only a general chill where his legs and arms should be.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Just as he was coming to terms with the idea that his mind had been decoupled from his flesh and that all these sensations were phantom memories and that his consciousness was floating somewhere inside his decomposing corpse, his eyes opened. They didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t open far for they\u8217\'92d been glued shut by the crust of death.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A few feet from his face was a sandstone ceiling, a ceiling stained black with soot. This was natural stone, a familiar texture where the rocky surface was smooth, craggy, and porous all at once\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a difficult thing to capture with a brush. It was a surface unmarred by the clawing rake of chisels, meaning this was no tomb, or mineshaft, or one of those rock-hewn hermit homes that pock the Hias. A cave such as this, Mandri surmised, could only mean that he was dead, and his body had been borne down to Shis. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He realized that there was a meager firelight somewhere near. He searched for its source, but he could not move his neck. Instead he swiveled his eyes about. He could see only that the cramped walls of this cave bulged out in places and disappeared into pitch-blackness in others.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Surely, this was Shis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quite match his expectations.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He closed his eyes and conjured up an image of the dark earth riddled with pockets of air like this one, each one occupied by a waking corpse like him, each person forced to endure the mire of their own stench for an odd eternity. He found this pleasant, because he wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be bothered in such a place. There\u8217\'92d be no obligations. And since he was already dead, he wouldn\u8217\'92t have to eat, and that meant he didn\u8217\'92t have to worry about where his next meal would come from.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He tried to bend his arms, but he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He looked down at his body and saw that he was wrapped tight in a brown woolen blanket, and he lay flat on a bed of straw. He did have arms wrapped under that brown blanket. He saw the fingertips of his left hand peeking out from under a blanket fold, and like what happens in a dream, as soon as he saw them, feeling flooded into them. All at once, he had full use of his arm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He wriggled around to loosen the blanket, and then pulled his left arm free. It was in remarkably good condition for a dead man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm. He tossed off the rest of the blanket and sat up, and his joints creaked. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His own gangly anatomy brought a wrinkle to his nose. its skin was smooth and hairless, seemingly burnished to a gloss as if wet, and it was streaked here and there by crusted mud. The ghoul was so skinny that its stringy tendons were almost as strong as its muscles, and its deeply furrowed ribs deepened further with its every breath. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He examined the rest of his body piece by piece, and nothing was black and rotting as he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d expected, though he was much dirtier. A  grievous wound. Its spider-like finger traced a long line of crude, scabbed-up stitches that ran up the middle of its chest and bent over its heart. Two stitches nearer the middle had burst, leaving a red-lipped slit that exposed a gleaming sternum.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  shockingly free of the rankling pain it must be feeling from the wound on its chest. Only a mere soreness. Figured in Shis the pain would be excruciating.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He looked to his left and was surprised to see that the source of light was not a tongue of fire piping up from the bowels of the earth, it was, instead, a small flame dancing on a thick flaxen wick that bathed in a shallow clay bowl of tallow. Far from comforting, it was a fright, for its scant orange light licked at a leathery woman who sat cross-legged in brown outland garb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She was staring at him with cold eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She was a demon no doubt. A demon wearing a woman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She was here to torture him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She wore a serene expression which was couched in generic Hrkan features\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 thin lips and sad eyes, all in symmetrical and near genderless proportion. She\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d clearly seen enough of the sun. Mandri wondered why she wasn\u8217\'92t currently torturing him. Perhaps she was a cell-mate of sorts, a human half-transformed, for it was said that there were pits under the earth where humans were molded into demons. Perhaps she was a vision of what was in store for him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My name\u8217\'92s Seb,\u8221\'94 she said. Her cheeks squelched with spit, and she spat a wad of it into a flickering shadow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stood up, slow and deliberate, half because he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to make any sudden movements that could be misinterpreted, and half because his muscles simply couldn\u8217\'92t move any faster. His intention was to find an exit. His tousled hair brushed against the low ceiling as he felt his way along the sandstone towards the shadows on his right.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. So, Mandri shuffled back the other way, to the left, keeping close to the rock, staying as far away as he could from the leathery woman who watched him with intent. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s searching fingers found a wide crack in the rock behind him. It seemed to be a dark opening that he could shimmy through, but when he stuck his arm into it, his fingers butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his back exposed in present company, he returned to his brown blanket and straw bed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was only one other direction to explore\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 behind the woman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s right shoulder was a hole in the rock that was wide enough to crawl into. Mandri\u8217\'92s eyes strained to see if it dead-ended.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No way out that way,\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93Only two ways out\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 straight up, but it\u8217\'92 not somethin\u8217\'92 you can fit through. Just another cranny for the lizards.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lizards?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lizards.\u8221\'94 Seb affirmed as she pointed up with a calloused hand. There on the ceiling, half-buried in sooty cracks, were a dozen or so black blobs. Mandri took them for some strange fungal growth, but then one of them squeaked and scurried along the ceiling towards the unexplored passageway. Its tiny talons scratched the rock as it went. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb laughed. Hers was an grating laugh, and it had an unmistakable Hrkan lilt. It sounded like a demon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cackle, if indeed demons could cackle. It did nothing to allay Mandri\u8217\'92s suspicion that this was a demon wearing a woman\u8217\'92s skin. So, he asked her straight, \u8220\'93What are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Already told you. My name\u8217\'92s Seb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri pulled his blanket up tight around his shoulders. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you a demon?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb smiled. Her smile was nearly black in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs, but her graveyard of a mouth was just as frightening.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you think I\u8217\'92m a demon?\u8221\'94 she asked as she spat again into the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You deny it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You poked, boy? I look like a demon to you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A little.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb studied her own gangly self in mock surprise. Then she leaned forward and said, eying Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ruined chest, \u8220\'93One of us ain\u8217\'92t human, and it ain\u8217\'92t me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri drew up his knees and pulled his blanket around them, hiding his whole body underneath.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now,\u8221\'94 said Seb. \u8220\'93I given you my name, only fair you give me yours.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to tell you my name,\u8221\'94 Mandri said flatly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But sharing names is a kindly gesture. An believe you me, you gonna need every kindness you can get.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What would you do with my name?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would call you by it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had heard stories about what demons did with names. Some outland folk kept their true names hidden even from family for fear of what demons could do if they overheard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How about this,\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t tell me a name. Tell me what noise should I make to grab your ear. How about Gunk? You look like Gunk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Call me whatever you want. There\u8217\'92s only the two of us here. Names don\u8217\'92t matter.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Only the two of us? You sure about that? You missed the lizards, you might have missed somethin\u8217\'92 else.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes darted to the shadows over Seb\u8217\'92s shoulder, suddenly expecting a fanged and snarling something to jump out. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb smirked. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, not there. There\u8217\'92s man on the other side of that crack behind you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That crack ends in stone,\u8221\'94 Mandri said confidently. \u8220\'93I checked.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It ends in a stone door. If you don\u8217\'92t believe then listen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 you can hear a man snoring.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri listened carefully, but he heard nothing. Then Seb mimicked a snoring sound, her arm directing the pitch in and out, directing Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s attention towards its unsteady rhythm. Then Mandri caught it, the faintest of faint sounds sneaking out of the crack in the wall to his left\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 someone was surely there, snoring. Though it could hardly be called snore, for it sputtered and gurgled, like someone was choking on sick.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92d be Hill,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hill? Is that a name?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s Hill\u8217\'92s name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hill sounds like he\u8217\'92s about to die.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I gave him one o\u8217\'92 my borcandi spines.\u8221\'94 Seb pulled out the spine she was currently chewing to demonstrate. She popped it back in and added, \u8220\'93The juice gets phlegmy in the throat. It gives it that\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hear it? Like a wet rattle.\u8221\'94 She demonstrated this as well be gumming up her own throat with spit and faking a snore.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stared at her impish grin with disgust. He was beginning to suspect that she was human after all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is this not Shis?\u8221\'94 he asked. \u8220\'93Am I not dead?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 feel }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 dead?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Seb replied.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. But who is to say what being dead feels like? If this is death, then death feels much like living, only colder\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 so then yes, I do feel dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re not dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But I remember dying. I remember\u8230\'85I remember that bastard Minder was hauling me through the rain, and I watched someone kill him and\u8230\'85wait a minute\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He studied the Seb with a more careful eye. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen that face hiding under that bush the ravine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That was }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 !\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 he exclaimed with all the excitement of a sudden revelation. \u8220\'93You were hiding under that bush! You killed my Minder!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I did,\u8221\'94 Seb said proudly. \u8220\'93Got his right hand here. Pulled it right out of your chest.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She pulled a severed hand from out behind her and tossed it onto Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet. Mandri scuttled his toes out of the way, but somehow the sight of the bloody hand didn\u8217\'92t bother him. He imagined what it must have looked like, swimming around the viscous goo inside his chest. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So I am really dead then,\u8221\'94 he muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I told you once already, you not dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But they stole my Spark and made me a Mazid. So without a Minder\u8217\'92s will inside me, I\u8217\'92d be dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Like you said, you got no Spark. So what business would a sparkless git like you have in Shis?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But this feels like Shis.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Feels like a cave to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But you killed my Minder. I remember feeling like all my strings had been cut.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You got a new Minder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Dabbed the stitches with a careful finger. Seb still had both her hands, so it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who is my Minder then?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had no answer. Not that it mattered. At this point, there was nothing that Seb could say or do that could convince Mandri that he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t stuck in Shis, and he was about to say as much when he was interrupted}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Boy\u8217\'92s awake!\u8221\'94 Seb shouted. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1   Mandri heard the sound of stone sliding against stone. The heavy block of a door opened, torchlight flooded in, and a short and stout Jandri man bumbled into the cave, hunched over, the flame of his torch licking the ceiling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 When the stout man saw Mandri sitting up, staring at him, he nearly dropped his torch.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He glared at Seb like she were }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri said to the stout man, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You must be Hill.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Hill swung the torch back towards Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face, stinging Mandri\u8217\'92s nose with its heat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t talk,\u8221\'94 Hill said. The torchlight illuminated his untamed face, which was all scarred up, and his wide chin was scraggled up with patchy fuzz. His breath was somehow fouler than the stench of the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri recoiled and squeaked in disgust.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You be quiet!\u8221\'94 Hill shouted. Mandri flinched against the bright specks of spit that flew out from Hill\u8217\'92s throat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 In this brighter light, Seb was much the same, every bit a weather-beaten poke, with dark robes half-ripped and wrapped tight. Her leathery skin was etched with lines which probably lied about her years. Pokes were always much younger than they actually looked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Hill leaned into the light and said to Mandri, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you flap them lips again, I\u8217\'92ll clip \u8216\'91em.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The stout man chuckled in agreement. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s how it is now. You\u8217\'92re with the Ayramun. And best remember\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 with us, if you break the rules, you get broken. And the rule for you is, you nod or shake your head. That\u8217\'92s all you do, nod or shake. Get it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The skinny woman spat a wad of unspeakable phlegm right onto Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s knee. She smiled to herself, then said to Mandri, \u8220\'93What were you doin\u8217\'92 out in that wagon, anyways?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri did not know how to answer the question by only moving his head. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t think he\u8217\'92d be able to answer it with words, as he had no idea what she was talking about.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She laughed again. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s like a rat in a bucket.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You will be too if we don\u8217\'92t hurry up,\u8221\'94 said the stouter fellow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, yeah.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The woman pulled Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s limp weight up onto her shoulder, and she ferried him out into the darkness. The stout man pulled Mandri up by the collar of his tunic and forced him to follow behind the woman. As Mandri left the cave, he caught a glimmer of Seb\u8217\'92s cheek and he swore he saw the Mazid wink.}
