From the perspective of the reawakened dead, it is a state of woozy cognizance characterized by a hissing buzz at the edge of the mind. The word itself is derived from the word eldruub, which is the name ascribed to the wild slosh of ocean foam that washes ashore during a world storm. The stronger the storm, the more foam there is. Sometimes an entire coast will be covered in that salty sand-dusted spume, six feet of it, deep enough so that the air becomes filled with a hissing buzz as an uncountable number of bubbles pop. This sound is not loud, it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s simply there and it is everywhere. Days later, after the sea foam dissipates, there comes again the sight of solid ground, but the shoreline is unfamiliar, for the passing storm has ravaged it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1  Mandrameen didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t notice hissing buzz of the Sheldruub. He didn\u8217\'92t notice the feeling of his own blood pumping through his veins and tickling his insides back into working order. He had no awareness that he had been brought back to life. He was afraid, and he was afraid because his first rekindled was the memory of his Minder being stabbed over and over. If his Minder was dead, he must be dead, bound as he was to his Minder\u8217\'92s will.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He believed that he was a cold corpse floating in a void.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 This was the afterlife.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The signs were unmistakable.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 His very bones were ice and his whole face was numb\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 if his face was there at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was the unmistakable putrescence of rotting flesh. Mandri knew the smell well because when he was a child, rats would die in the burrow underneath his floor and he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have to endure the stench. He couldn\u8217\'92t escape the smell by sleeping outside. He\u8217\'92d tried that once and gilt flies got to him. When he woke, his whole left cheek was covered in blistering welts the size of fingernails. His right cheek had been spared, nestled as it was in his pillow, so he looked like he\u8217\'92d been slapped in the face by disease.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Presumably, the present smell was coming from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Just as he was coming to terms with the idea that his mind had been decoupled from his flesh and that his consciousness was floating somewhere inside his decomposing corpse, his eyes opened. They didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t open far for they\u8217\'92d been glued shut by the crust of death.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A few feet from his face was a sandstone ceiling stained black with soot. This was natural stone, a familiar texture where the rocky surface was both smooth and craggy\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a difficult thing to capture with a brush. It was a surface unmarred by the clawing rake of chisels, meaning this was no tomb, or mineshaft, or one of those rock-hewn hermit homes that pock the Hias. A cave such as this, Mandri surmised, could only mean that he was dead, and his body had been borne by demons down to Shis. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was a meager firelight somewhere near. He searched for its source, but he could not move his neck. He could only swivel his eyes about. From this he gathered that the cramped walls of this tiny cave bulged out in places and disappeared into pitch-blackness in others.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Surely, this was Shis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quite match his expectations. Shis was supposed to be a fiery void in which a column of the dead, millions strong, whirled inside a net of spiked chains. His present environment was mundane in comparison, and if this was typical of the underworld then perhaps the earth was riddled with pockets of air like this one, each one occupied by a waking corpse like him, each person forced to endure the mire of their own stench for an odd eternity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Maybe there was something he was supposed to do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Looking down his nose he could see his whole body wrapped tight in a brown woolen blanket. He noticed the fingertips of his left hand peeking out from under a fold, and like what happens in a dream, as soon as he saw them, feeling flooded into them. All at once, he had full use of his arm and shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He wriggled around to loosen the blanket and pulled his left arm free. It was in remarkably good condition for a dead man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm, thought it was extraordinarily sore. In fact, his whole body was sore. He tossed the blanket off and sat up and his joints creaked in alarm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The sight of his own naked self brought a wrinkle to his nose. He was streaked here and there by crusted mud, and his deeply furrowed ribs deepened even further with every wheezing breath. Nothing was black and rotting as he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d expected, though there was a grievous wound in his chest, right were Salavan had opened him up some days ago. He had no way of knowing how long ago that was. It was certainly long enough ago that the wound shouldn\u8217\'92t look as fresh as it did. There was new stitching riddling that wound, and it was crudely done, scabbed-up. Two stitches nearer the middle of the scar had burst, leaving a red-lipped slit that exposed his gleaming sternum.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He dabbed it with his finger expecting a rankling pain, but there was only a twinge that quickly faded. Satisfied that Shis was nowhere near the plane of torment it was said to be, Mandri relaxed. He looked to his left and was surprised to see that the source of light in this cave was not a tongue of fire piping up from the bowels of the earth, it was, instead, a small flame dancing on a thick flaxen wick that bathed in a shallow bowl of tallow. Its scant orange light licked at a figure sitting cross-legged across from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 A woman!}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri yelped in fright. A sudden urge to flee overwhelmed him. His obdurate limbs, freshly undead, only spasmed and cramped as if they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been caught in a vise. Mandri\u8217\'92s yelp transformed into a hiss of pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 The woman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dark eyes flickered with amusement.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been sitting there. The whole time. Watching him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She was, no doubt, a demon, a demon wearing a woman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s skin. Mandri was sure. She was here to torture him. She had the face for it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 an odd, serene expression couched in skin that had seen much too much of the sun. She had thin lips and sad eyes, with missing eyebrows, those signposts to the Spark. She looked like an under-painting of an old woman wrapped up tight in browns. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My name\u8217\'92s Seb,\u8221\'94 she said. Her cheeks squelched with spit, and she spat a wad of slimy green into a shifting shadow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri backed up against the rock and tried to stand. He moved slow and deliberate, half because he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to make any sudden movements that could be misinterpreted, and half because his muscles simply couldn\u8217\'92t move any faster. His tousled hair brushed against the low ceiling as he felt his way along the sandstone towards the shadows on his right. He hoped to find an exit, but the rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. He shuffled back to the left, naked as a worm, keeping close to the rock, and his searching fingers found a wide crack. It seemed to be a dark opening that he could shimmy through, but when he stuck his arm into it his knuckles butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his self exposed in present company, he returned to his brown blanket.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 There was only one other direction to explore\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there was a hole in the rock next to the mysterious woman named Seb. It seemed wide enough to crawl into. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes strained to see if it dead-ended.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s jus a cranny for lizards,\u8221\'94 Seb said, seeming to read his mind. \u8220\'93If you want out, you could try flyin\u8217\'92 up, but skinny as you are I don\u8217\'92t spose it\u8217\'92s somethin\u8217\'92 you can fit through.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Flying?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked without realizing he\u8217\'92d even asked it. His voice was as hoarse as a ghost\u8217\'92s.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s answer was to point up. There on the ceiling, half-buried in sooty cracks, were a dozen or so black blobs. Mandri took them for strange fungal growths, but then one of them squeaked and scurried along the ceiling towards a vertical chute. Its tiny talons scratched the rock as it went. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb laughed at Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s surprise. Hers was an grating laugh, half-cackle, half Hrkan lilt. It did nothing to allay Mandri\u8217\'92s suspicion that she was a demon wearing a woman\u8217\'92s skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri pulled his blanket up tight around his shoulders.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you here to torture me?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb smiled in full, and her smile was nearly black in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs, but her graveyard of rotten teeth was just as frightening.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think I\u8217\'92m a demon?\u8221\'94 she asked as she leaned aside and spat again into the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You deny it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I look like a demon to you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb studied her own dirty self in mock surprise. Then she leaned forward and eyed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ruined chest. \u8220\'93One of us ain\u8217\'92t human, and it ain\u8217\'92t me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri drew up his knees and pulled his blanket around them, hiding his whole body underneath. This little deflection put a curl in Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cheek. She asked, \u8220\'93You do know what you are, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri stayed quiet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a Mazid,\u8221\'94 Seb declared. \u8220\'93And I given you my name, so it\u8217\'92s only fair you give me yours.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to tell you my name,\u8221\'94 Mandri said flatly. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sharing names is a kindly gesture, an believe you me, every kindness you can get should be taken.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What would you do with my name?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would call you by it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri had heard stories about what demons did with names. Some outland folk kept their true names hidden even from family for fear of what demons could do if they overheard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How about this,\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t tell me no name. Tell me what noise I can make to grab your ear. How about Gunk? You look like a Gunk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Call me whatever you want,\u8221\'94 said Mandri defensively. \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s only the two of us here. Names don\u8217\'92t matter.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Only the two of us? You sure about that? You missed the lizards, you might have missed someone else.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes darted to the shadows over Seb\u8217\'92s shoulder, suddenly expecting a fanged and snarling something to jump out. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb smirked. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s man on the other side of that crack behind you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That crack ends in stone,\u8221\'94 Mandri said confidently. \u8220\'93I checked.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It ends in a stone door. If you don\u8217\'92t believe then listen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 you can hear a man snoring.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri listened carefully, but he heard nothing. To help him along, Seb mimicked a snoring sound, her arm directing the pitch in and out, directing Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s attention towards its unsteady rhythm. Then Mandri caught the faintest of faint sounds sneaking out of the crack in the wall to his left\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 someone was surely there, snoring. Though it could hardly be called snore, for it sputtered and gurgled like someone was choking on sick.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92d be Hill,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hill? Is that a name?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s Hill\u8217\'92s name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is he another one of your victims?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What? No. I jus\u8217\'92 gave him one o\u8217\'92 my borcandi spines.\u8221\'94 Seb pulled out the spine she was currently chewing to demonstrate. She admired the drooping string of spit attached to it, then popped it back in and added, \u8220\'93The juice gets phlegmy in the throat. It gives it that\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hear it? Like a wet rattle.\u8221\'94 She demonstrated this as well be gumming up her own throat with spit and imitating Hill\u8217\'92s wet snore. This amused her considerably. It disgusted Mandri. He was beginning to suspect that she was human after all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is this not Shis?\u8221\'94 he asked. \u8220\'93Am I not dead?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that what you\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 No. You ain\u8217\'92t dead. You }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 feel }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 dead?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. But who is to say what being dead feels like? If this is death, then death feels much like living, only colder\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 so then yes, I do feel dead. And I remember dying. I remember\u8230\'85I remember blasting that bastard Hrk, and then my Minder was hauling me through the rain, and I watched someone kill him and\u8230\'85wait a minute\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 He studied the Seb with a more careful eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That was }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 !\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 he exclaimed in sudden revelation. \u8220\'93You were hiding under that bush! You killed my Minder! I saw you!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You saw correct,\u8221\'94 Seb said proudly. \u8220\'93Got his hand right here. Pulled it straight out your chest.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 She reached into her own shadow and pulled from it a severed hand. It was rotted black at the wrist and coated in crust of dried blood. Its sudden appearance sent a fresh wave of stink wafting to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s nose. To think that thing was once swimming around inside his chest, gripping his heart, it was almost too much. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So I am really dead then,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb sighed and tossed the stiff hand and Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet. \u8220\'93I already told you,\u8221\'94 she said as Mandri kicked the thing away. \u8220\'93You ain\u8217\'92t dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But without a Minder\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Right, you\u8217\'92d be dead. But you\u8217\'92d be }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1\cf1 dead }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 dead \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91cause you a Mazid. You got no Spark. What business would a sparkless git like you have in Shis?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri thought about that for a moment. It was a reasonable point. His Spark had been stolen and without it, what use was an afterlife? He had no Spark to cleanse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But this looks like Shis,\u8221\'94 he said defiantly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb spat again into the shadow. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Feels like a cave to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But how am I alive if my Minder is dead?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You got a new Minder. It\u8217\'92s not me,\u8221\'94 she said as she held up both her hands to show that neither was missing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Before Mandri could ask who his Minder was, there came the sound of stone sliding against stone. The heavy block of a door opened and torchlight flooded into the cramped cave. A short and stout Jandri man bumbled in, hunched over. The flame of his torch tickled the ceiling. When he saw Mandri sitting up, staring at him, he nearly dropped his torch altogether.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shoulda said he woke up!\u8221\'94 he shouted as he set his glare upon Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He woke up,\u8221\'94 Seb replied with a wry grin. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri, feeling lively, said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You must be Hill.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Hill swung the torch around. Its heat stung Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s nose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t talk,\u8221\'94 Hill said as the torchlight illuminated his own untamed face. He was all scarred up, and his wide chin was practically a landscape unto itself, weeded with patchy fuzz.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri recoiled. He could not keep his upper lip from curling in distaste.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya scared?!\u8221\'94 Hill hollered. \u8220\'93Ya should be!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Bright specks of spit flew out from Hill\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s throat, and he leaned in closer, close enough to give Mandri a measure of his rancid breath. \u8220\'93An\u8217\'92 don\u8217\'92t think for a finger ya kin talk out wats comin\u8217\'92 to ya. If you flap them lips, I\u8217\'92ll clip \u8216\'91em. And you too, Seb. Both o\u8217\'92 ya.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Seb grumbled and huffed as she picked herself up. In this brighter torchlight she looked every bit a weather-beaten poke. The lines which etched her face probably lied about her years. Outland folk were always much younger than they seemed. She was spry and moved like a huntress, but Mandri would have guessed she was at least fifty-five. She hustled out into the darkness of the cave beyond.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Boy,\u8221\'94 Hill said contemptuously to Mandri\u8217\'92s cringing self, \u8220\'93Ya with the Ayramun now, so best remember\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 with us, if ya break the rules, ya get broke. The rule is, nod or shake ya head. That\u8217\'92s all ya do, nod or shake. Get it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t bother with \u8216\'91im,\u8221\'94 said Seb from the darkness beyond. \u8220\'93Boy can\u8217\'92t see sense if it slapped him. Like a rat in a bucket.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 Hill pulled Mandri up by the elbow and ushered him out after Seb, with nothing but that thin brown blanket to keep out the chill.}}
