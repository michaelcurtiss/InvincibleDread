            <Text>The Minder looked upon his Mazid with some confusion and asked it, “Is that true?”
“Yes,” said the Mazid meekly. “The man posed no imminent threat.”
“Did I tell you to spare our quarry if it posed no imminent threat?”
“No.”
“Did I give any order that could be construed as a grant of mercy to any of these outland pokes?”
“No.”
“Then tell me, why did you not burn him down?”
The Mazid gave no answer.
“That was not a rhetorical question,” the Minder said.
“I guess…I’m not sure”
“You’re not sure!?” the Minder exclaimed, as if the utterance was not possible.
“Hah!” laughed the captain. “You see? You’ve barely got a hold of that thing.”</Text>

            <Text>Only two answers to the questions “what is”
Nature - tables chairs, atoms etc. No room for gods.

Jesus saw that the Jewish method of acquiring righteousness (which is radical observance of god’s laws), did not lead them to an understanding of the spirit of the law. Because of this he (and/or his followers), devised a new method for acquiring righteousness (faith in Jesus as God, and the working of the holy spirit within the believer.) I have seen that this Christian method of acquiring righteousness does not actually lead them to an understanding of the spirit of the law, as evidenced in things like the crusades, slavery, hatred of homosexuality, transgender, etc. This is not to say that there are *NO* christians who do understand the spirit of the law, it is to say that they are not found in any greater or lesser proportion than people who follow other belief systems - that is, their method is not any more reliable to achieving righteous understanding (not action), than any other method.

Wittgenstein - philosophical illness is a result of —-

The problem with Eisenmann’s claims is that they fundamentally misapprehend realiety - “A jew couldn’t have written this” - Paul is ‘anti-semitic’ - but this misapprehends the length of it.

More likely - jewish christains weren’t keeping some aspect of the law, this offended paul, he changes modes, and pushes it to its logical extreme.


It should be categorically stated, as noted in the Introduction, that a Jewish document can be sectarian, that is, anti-Pharisee or even anti-Sadducee, as the Dead Sea Scrolls most certainly are and the Gospels at their most authentic sometimes are, but it cannot be anti-Semitic. This would be a contradiction in terms. It is possible to oppose persons of a different party or sectarian persuasion, nationalist or anti-nationalist, cosmopolitan or xenophobic, as Josephus does; but one cannot be against one’s self - except abnormally. Paul sometimes exhibits this baffling characteristic, but, as we shall show, Paul is perhaps not really Jewish in the manner he thinks or advertises himself to be.

            <Title>Ayram Scratch</Title>
            <Text>The genre of the conquering hero existed in the time when Solraheen still walked the earth. Most of those ancient hero icons contained no sign of Solraheen, so it was thought that if Solraheen permitted an Old Jandri king to depict a victory without reference to Himself, then it must be permitted forever. If a Hrkan Lord wins a great battle then he is permitted to depict this event without reference to Solraheen. 
But why would Solraheen approve of such effrontery? The leading Solitant view is that Solraheen afforded great men this privilege so as to harness their natural pride. He wanted them willing and eager to go out and expand the borders of His paradise. When a Hrkan Lord brought barbarians to heel, wealth and land was his, and so too was the right to place himself at the front of all creation—if only for one single work of art. It may seem heretical, but if Solraheen Himself approved of it, then by definition it was the orthodox view.
An alternative interpretation of the form of the Old Jandri conquering hero is that it was not meant to be a carrot, but a stick. A statue of a snarling Lord was meant to instill fear in the poor wretches who were conquered, and Solraheen, being a loving god, did not want to be associated with this imagery. As such he allowed the Lords to forgo the traditional sign of respect. When the dispossessed saw the statues of Lords from a foreign land, they did not see the sign of Solraheen, and so they did not blame Him for their misery.



Bound Will

“A Minder cannot command me to do anything, but they can stop me from doing something they don’t want me to do.”
“You lie.”
“I do not.”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to do something, and stopping you from doing something?”
“To command is to direct, to stop is to interfere.”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which.”
There was a clever wrinkle to Ayram’s words, and they gave Obo pause. A flicker of amusement flashed across his too-smooth, too-pale features. 





When this was done, Ayram held the waterskin out before him and poured the rest of its contents into the sand.
The Ayramun erupted in laughter. Mandri didn’t laugh because the sight of that cool, crystal water being wasted on the sand brought his own great thirst into sudden, stark relief.
If Obo was bothered by any of it, he did not show it, and when Ayram finished with his little show, he said, 

 “If the girl can’t control you, then why haven’t you split me in half with Mazidfire?”
“Only my Minder can call forth the fire.”

            <Title>Pain</Title>
            <Text>One religion is True and the rest are False. This categorization satisfies most instincts, but some aren’t content with a simple dichotomy so they further divide the world’s religions through a rigorous analysis of the similarities and differences of belief and behavior.
Solitants come specially prepared for battle in this arena. When they proselytize to the fractured, they open with the observation that every religion in existence begins with a story that explains the origin of suffering. The Supine Cult believes that there are two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter. The Bavainu believe that suffering is a result of one’s own evil acts, or one’s ancestors. The Shell Kings believe that suffering is a symptom of Shellkhashar, which is a kind of spiritual disease which dulls virtuous instinct. There are a hundred more religions, each with a hundred variations, and in every instance, the story of suffering’s arrival is accompanied by a solution for it. The Supine Cult entreats their followers to lay down and pray their energy into the sky to make it stronger, for that is where the righteousness dwells. The Bavainu say that if you live rightly and follow their ancient laws, your life will be a happy one. The Shell Kings recommend drinking the blood of a willing virgin mixed with a mind melting toxin found in a sea snail’s shell. Every religion has its own solution to suffering, they’re all in that category, every one of them is peddling relief—all of them except for the Solitants.
The Solitants offer no solution to life’s troubles. &quot;We’re the only ones who believe that suffering is not something to fear,&quot; a Solitant priest will say. 
&quot;Suffering is what this is all about!&quot;
He or she then smiles, and the smile accentuates the self-inflicted scar on their cheek which marks the rite of initiation into Solitant orders. Some Solitants can't get enough of it, and they smile underneath a mask of scars.
&quot;Life is suffering&quot;, they say. &quot;Try to suffer without suffering.&quot; They laugh because it doesn’t make any sense. Truly, the Divine Spark is like a block of sculptor's stone. It is clean, abstract, inert, featureless—and then comes the sculptor's chisel. As the chisel carves away at the stone to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the person. What troubles our fleshy vessels is what makes us who we are. Solitants are artists of the Self and their chisel is pain. Solraheen guides the hammer.
Typical Hrkan speech has only the one word—pain. If a person says, “I am in pain,” there’s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe, or did a loved one just die? Have their bowels been blocked for days? The word ‘pain’ can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are using the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The words ‘anguish’, ‘ache’, ‘soreness’, ‘irritation’, and ‘misery’ all approach different things, but they’re not nearly enough to cover the spectrum.
The intrepid Solitant, with linguistic flair, goes as far as to claim that the very structure of Hrkan speech stunts the growth of pain appreciation, because the mind cannot develop a sensitivity to certain flavors of agony if the world is divided up into subject, verb, and object, for when the Self is disassociated from the action and the cause, grand vistas of becoming remain hidden from sight.
In Mandrameen’s view, pain was best expressed through the natural language of gesture, as Solraheen intended. In breadth of expression, the face is far, far superior to the Solitant’s rule-governed, rasping utterances. Of what use is a fuzzy word when you can see the pain written on the face clear as day? Observe the eye and brow of a person in pain—is there languor, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience, anxiety? Is the skin knit tight, is it smooth, is it beaded with sweat? Is the eye’s lid puffy or hollow? Are the cheeks wet or dry, dark or pale, sallowing brown, or purple, or yellow? Then there’s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up into the face. The lower back knots up, the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, and finally the lips draw tight and the teeth gnash. A trained eye can look at another in pain and know, without words, the entirety of their inner world. The holy language of the Solitants is redundant, and no argument could convince Mandri otherwise.
Until now.
The pain from the demon bite in his thigh was so intense that the slightest pressure elicited a scream. The skin around the already black wound was taut and throbbing, a drumhead reverberating pain. Moto tried to make him walk, but that was impossible, so Moto carried him. He tossed Mandrameen atop his pack, and with each step that Moto took, Mandri’s raw wound chafed against Moto’s shoulder, sending a fresh wave of excruciating pain into Mandri’s groin and hip.
Moto trotted along the Pitted Portion, and every now and then he expressed his unconcern with an annoyed snort. Since Mandri lacked the word to adequately describe the nature of his pain, he was forced to make one up. After a particularly brutal fit, he stiffened up and screamed, “EeeauuughhhGoddamnyousonofahukgukuk!”
“Shut up,” said Moto. “You did this to yourself.”
“You shit!” screamed Mandri. “You-uueeauughhhhh!”
You-uueeauughhhhh was no exaggeration. If Moto had the ear for it, he would have stopped and immediately administered the most tender care. Instead, he kept on walking, and Mandri fainted again from the torture.
Mandri woke up several hands later to a clear night sky of starry black. Chattering voices swirled around his barely conscious mind. He assumed that one of those voices was Moto’s. Maybe one of them was his. The only thing he knew for certain was that he was still bouncing atop Moto’s shoulders, still marching through the Sand. By now his leg was numb, and he could feel the demon’s poison gnawing at his chest, constricting his heart and lungs. Every breath was a labor. He fainted again.
He woke up the next day when Moto leaned back and dropped Mandri from a height like a camel dropping dung. Mandri landed hard on his wounded thigh and he let loose a gargled curse, and tried to find some twist of hip and spine that could give him relief, finally laying all the way back and shifting most of his weight onto his right ass cheek. Mandri’s reeling mind found the space to understand that he was still alive and that feeling had returned to his extremities. He could breathe. He was not dead. Damn it all.
Through the demon-clawed hole in his robe he could see that his affected thigh had been poulticed and bandaged, though it was poorly done, as the brown woolen wraps were ragged and splitting apart. A few sturdy threads were all that was holding the spongy dried-green weeds together. 
He looked up and saw that the reason Moto dropped him was because they’d arrived at some accursed destination—an enormous black rock sitting in the middle of a flat and barren sandy landscape.
Mandri was astonished by the sight of it. It wasn’t just any big rock, it was a single uncracked rock. Rocks that big in the Sand tend to look like old, slumping things that have been half-melted by the sun, but this rock, this biggest of all boulders, was a healthy, oblong rock. And more astonishing was that it balanced above the Sand on its belly. So unnatural and precarious was its position that it seemed a strong blast of wind should be able to pick the whole thing up and send it tumbling along the desert floor. Mandri felt that if he stood next to it and gave a hearty push, he could get it rolling. 
Sitting as it was in an empty desert landscape, with no other rocky eminence in sight, well, that made it seem like the rock had been deliberately placed there by the hand of Solraheen. Surely, it was a holy site.
Moto was stooped over a big pile of the Ayramun’s haulings. Evidently everyone else had simply tossed their stuff together before heading off to who knows where. Mandri looked for a pit, but there was none that he could see. There were only two other Ayramun present, dour looking men, milling about the pack heap. Moto unstrapped his own pack and tossed on top of the others.
He asked the two millers, in an accusing tone, “What are you two doing?”
“We’ve been looking for you,” said one of them, a Zosan whose only distinguishing feature was a polished brass hoop wrapped tight around his neck.
“Looks to me like you've been tickling dick,” Moto replied. 
“We got told to look for you, and here we are, lookin right at you.”
Moto nodded towards Mandri and said, “Well, now you can look at him. Make sure he doesn’t go and do something stupid.”
“How about we take you to Ayram, as we been ordered to do.”
Moto shrugged and said, “Lead on.”
The three men walked off towards the giant black rock. They walked around it, and then disappeared.
Mandri wasn’t so concerned about where they went because he was busy nursing that meager relief that he’d twisted himself into.
He decided then that he well and truly hated Moto. This was more than the flippant hate he doled out to everyone and no one in particular. He tried to recall the words to an Old Jandri curse that could kill a callous man Moto, but the pain in his leg was a powerful amnestic. He then set about preparing the ground around him so that he could more comfortably wallow in his self-pity. Eventually, he decided to shimmy over to the pile of packs so that he could lean against it and watch that enigmatic rock, and as soon as he did, something on the other side of the pile groaned, right from where those dullards had been standing earlier.
Mandri crawled up onto the pile of packs towards the sound. Thankfully, this pile was a remarkably comfortable assortment of squishy bags, and once on top of the heap he spied the thing that made the noise—a lump of dusty black rags laying in the sand a few feet away. 
Mandri dragged himself closer to get a better look. He was careful not to disrupt the tenuous peace he’d negotiated between himself and the wound in his thigh. As soon as the pain flared up he stopped moving altogether. He nestled his elbow into a bag of grain, and let his hip sink gently into an inside-out goat bladder stuffed with jerky. Now that he was comfortably reclined, he was free to annoy that pile of rags just below him. They were Mazidobo’s rags, and the lump they covered was the right size for a handless, legless, Mazid.
Mandri felt around for something to poke Obo with. His searching fingers settled on an empty waterskin. He threw it at Obo, and the limp waterskin flapped harmlessly off the shrouded lump and dropped with a slap into the sand.
“I know you’re there,” Mandri said.
He waited, but no response came.
Mandri dug around in the pile for something else to throw. He was so tickled by all the little outland trinkets, stone beads, thumbstick idols of gods he didn’t know, that he almost didn’t register the dull, snapping crack of bone as Obo’s black rags twitched then went silent.
“You okay?” he asked the rags, but again, there was no answer.
Out of the pile, Mandri pulled a tight ball of twine. He tossed it underhand, and when it landed on that pile of rags they sighed. A moment later another crack of bone sounded out and the rags twitched again, but this time Obo’s jerking loosed a strap of robe to reveal his pale shoulder. Mandri watched, half in terror, half in curiosity as Obo’s pale and hairless head emerged from that mass of tattered robes.
“Hello, Mandri.”
Obo suddenly sat up, and his robes fell away to reveal a scrawny, bruised, and broken body. Mandri had seen some awful sights, but watching this pale Mazid use his blood-nub of an arm to find and fix a dislocated rib was something else entirely. And judging by the sorry state of Obo’s ragged robes, and the bloody abrasions splotching his rawbone shoulders, he hadn’t been carried through the desert like Mandri, he’d been dragged along its floor. 
Despite all the abuse, Obo’s mood was ordinary. He sat up and stretched what was left of his arms and legs as if he were a cat waking up from a nap. He twisted around to draw out the kinks of his spine, and as he did, Mandri noticed a thin scar running all the way up the middle of his back. It was a seam, as if Obo’s skin were somehow sewn onto his flesh, and this seam split at the base of his skull and circled around his ears. Then Obo’s stretch suddenly popped every single vertebrae in rapid succession, causing Mandri’s own spine to stiffen in sympathetic fright, a sudden jerk that unleashed a fresh wave of torture radiating out of his thigh.
He yelped. Obo smiled like a beerbat.
“What are you smiling at?” Mandri asked.
“I’m happy to have some company that doesn’t want to ruin me.”
Obo took up his robes in his mouth and scooted himself closer to the pile of the Ayramun’s packs, and as he leaned himself up against them, he caught Mandri staring at his drawn-and-quartered body. He spat out his robe and covered himself up as if it were a blanket.
Obo said quietly, “You should save that anxious look for yourself. I smell death on you. You are rushing up on corpsehood quite quickly.” He adjusted the folds of his robe.
Mandri looked down at his poorly poulticed leg and said, “I think I made it through the worst of it. Last night I could hardly breathe, but now I can breathe just fine.”
“What happened?”
“You won’t believe me.”
“I might.”
“I was bit by a demon.”
“A demon?”
“I said you wouldn’t believe me.”
“You’ve been seeing a lot of demons lately.”
“Now I’ve seen one for real. I thought they were all gone to be honest.”
“When you first saw me, you thought I was a demon. I think it’s worth appreciating that there is always a distinction between what you see, and your interpretation of what you see.”
Mandri winced hard as the pain in his leg reared and seared.
“You should let me look at the wound,” said Obo.
“Why?”
Obo shrugged. “I may be able to do something for the pain. I won’t know for sure unless I see it first.”
Mandri paused to consider. Despite Obo’s calm and generally amicable demeanor, there was no getting past the fact that Obo looked like a creature who wriggled around in caves. Obo’s ugly paleness was upsetting enough, but the absence of eyebrows, those signposts of the Spark, made it impossible to ascertain the intentions hidden behind his shine-silver eyes. 
But the pain in Mandri’s leg was stupid, and Mandri couldn’t think of many things worse than something stupid that refuses to go away, so he huffed and puffed and rolled himself down to where Obo sat. Once he made himself as comfortable as he could be, he rolled up the hem of his robe, and that’s when fear took hold of him.
Above his knee, all the many veins in his thigh ran black as ink, and nearer to the loose poultice, those black veins were bulging above his pallid skin like nightworms.
“Sol’s light,” Mandri muttered.
He gingerly unwrapped the long strip of wool that held the poultice in place. The various weedy leaves and lichens that composed the meat of the poultice were moist and spongy, and he was able to flick most of it into his open palm easily enough, but the rest he had to pluck, for the pulped leaf stems closer to the flesh were caked in a gooey dark-brown emulsion of infected blood and poultice paste.
“Try to clean it up,” said Obo.
“What do you think I’m doing.”
Mandri kept picking until all that was left was the terrifying sight of a day-old demon bite. The edges of this fang-scalloped wound were festering and black, and this jagged ring of necrotic flesh enclosed a puddle of that brown emulsion, which had, in parts, been scraped away to reveal the red-raw muscle of his thigh.
Opening the wound to the air reinvigorated it. Though the pain was extreme, it still looked worse than it felt. What really got Mandri worried was how his inky black veins spidered up his thigh and in towards his crotch.
“Let’s see the full extent of it”, Obo said as he leaned over the affected area.
“No. I don’t want to know what my uglies look like.”
“How does your chest feel?
Mandri looked at Obo very carefully. “Hurry up and do what you’re gonna do.”
Obo studied the wound with an impassive gaze, eyes darting from detail to detail, as if he were a dealer appraising an old vase and the particular texture and color of a scab could help him determine authenticity.
“Hurry up,” said Mandri.
Eventually Obo pulled back and said flatly, “I can’t do anything for you.”
“What?”
“That is the strangest bite wound I’ve ever seen. I’m half inclined to believe your story.”
“You said you could help with the pain.”
“Did I?”
“Don’t tell me you lied.”
“A Mazid never lies.”
“Oxshit, you lie all the time.” Mandri slapped the weedy poultice back onto his wound, and he did his best to re-roll that ragged strip of wool around it. When he was done, he leaned back against the mound of packs.
“Do you know what this place is?” Mandri finally asked, nodding towards the giant black rock.
“I overheard an Ayramun call it Minting Rock.”
“Wonder why it’s called that.”
“The name suggests it’s a place for these bandits to mint counterfeit coins away from prying eyes. But I’ve seen such places before and this one is different.”
“How so?”
“For one, most illegal mints are hidden near a spring. There is no spring here, so far as I can tell. And this rock, it’s too imposing to be a mere bandit’s den. It possesses a numinous beauty.”
“It does, doesn’t it? As if it were thrown down from the heavens. If it were blacker than it is, I’d call it a boulder of Fabled Black.”
“It’s not that. It’s granite.”
“I would say it’s a holy site, but these Ayramun are too crude for it. Especially Moto. The man is an ass. The man is a donkey wearing human skin.”
“My admittedly limited impression of the man was that he was one of the smarter ones.”
Mandri sighed and tried to calm himself by pulling out a small bag of spicy jerked beef from the mound of things. He popped one of these slips of beef into his mouth and tucked it into his cheek to let its flavors fix him. He said, “Moto’s not smart. He can speak well enough, but that doesn’t mean anything. He’s as dumb as the rest of them.”
“They’re not so bad.”
“I couldn’t disagree more. They’re cruel. That’s an easy way to know if someone is stupid—are they cruel? Look at what they’ve done to you.”
“I don’t know,” said Obo, wiggling his stumps under his rags. “I think that Ayram was right to do what he did.”
Mandri was waiting for a sarcastic wink but it never came.
“He chopped off your legs,” he said bitterly.
“And I’m thankful he showed such restraint,” said Obo. Still no wink.
Mandri chewed the jerky because he would scream from the pain in his leg if he didn’t. “You’ll never be able to walk again,” he said.
“Should I be angry about that?”
“Yes! You should! I’m angry for you. I tell you what, I’ll hate the Ayramun for the both of us. They deserve it for what they’ve done to me—and you.”
“I thought a demon did that to you.”
Mandri wagged his finger at Obo’s nose and said, “If that ass Moto didn’t tie me up and throw me into a lizard pit, I never would have been bit. Believe me, these people are half-demons themselves.”
“They’re only cruel because the Sand is cruel. If you’d been caught up by Kalemites, you’d have been eaten, and the one to consume your stomach would today be wearing your sacrum strapped onto his forehead.”
“I would have preferred that,” Mandri said with a wry grin.
“Maybe,” said Obo, dryly. “But the pain will pass, one way or another.”
Mandri shrugged, and the pair of them continued to sit in silence. Mandri chewed his way to the bottom of the small bag of jerky, when Obo, out of nowhere, said, “Mandri, do you hate me?”
The Mazid’s face was completely sincere. He asked again, “Do you hate Mazidai?”
Mandri kept chewing his last bit of beef, savoring the unfamiliar blend of spices. Some strange pepper in it. Definitely a heap of salt. He was getting thirsty now. He’d like some water. He shrugged and said, “I’ve only got enough hate in me for all of humanity.”
“Is that so?”
“There’s not any left over for a Mazid that’s been cut down to size. You’ve got no arms or legs so, it’s not like you can do anything to me—or anyone for that matter.”
“I’ve still got my Mazidfire.”
“Yeah, but you can’t control it, can you? I mean if you really want—” Mandri paused to lick his fingers. “If you really want, I could hate you a little bit.”
“I was hoping we could be friends instead.”
Mandri laughed, “You’re serious?”
“I am.”
“Well, a little hatred won’t get in the way of a good friendship. I don’t know if you know this, but friendship doesn’t actually require us to like each other.”
“I was under the impression that it did.”
“You’d be wrong.”
“How does that work? I thought the purpose of friendship was to make life less miserable.”
“That’s one way of putting it. Put another way, it’s an exchange of comfort predicated on self-interest. We don’t actually need to like each other to do that. Believe me, friendship—true friendship like you’re thinking of—it’s an illusion. It doesn’t exist. When one half starts to suffer, the other half stops lending comfort as soon as it becomes inconvenient. Like if it’s too much trouble for you to help me out, you’ll be gone. Don’t look so glum, it goes both ways.”
“It seems simpler to say that the one friend who gives up on the other wasn’t a friend to begin with than to deny the whole concept of friendship altogether.”
“You say that, but… I’ll put it this way, I’ve never actually seen a person willing to sacrifice something meaningful, against their own interest, in a time of need. Unless it’s for family. Family blood makes people insane.”
“I would disagree, but only because I can’t challenge your own experiences with my own as I have none to share.”
“Obo, you’ve never had a true friend because they don’t exist. But let’s not get caught up in semantics here—if you’re too attached to the word ‘friendship’, we can call it something else. Let’s call it hateship. You and I, we have a budding hateship.”
“If you hate me as a person, then I accept, because most people don’t even consider me to be a person.”
Mandri groaned at Obo’s clumsy appeal for pity, and he said, “Oh, come on.”
“What?”
“You’re laying it on way too thick, Obo.”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“You might be able to fool these outland pokes, but I’m a different breed.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Obo repeated.
“Let’s see—you don’t feel pain, you don’t feel anger, and I very much doubt you feel compassion. You’ve already tried to run away from these pokes once, but you were caught and got your legs chopped off. You’re not talking to me right now because you want a friend. What you’re doing is you’re scheming, and your schemes would stand better chances if you had arms and legs, but since you don’t have any, I’m the next best thing. You can’t exactly go running off into the Sand, but I can!”
“You can run on that leg?”
“Well, no. It’s the principle of it.”
“You must be the most skeptical creature that ever breathed a thought.”
“Am I wrong?”
“I do feel compassion.”
“I’ve seen a Mazid kill a hundred-score in a heartbeat.”
“When?”
“The massacre of Gudrk.”
“Gudrk was two hundred years ago.”
“I saw it in a painting.”
“Of course,” said Obo with a scoff.
“But am I wrong? You say you never lie, so answer me that—am I wrong?”
“Wrong about what?”
“That the only reason you’re talking to me is because you want to use me for whatever escape you’re scheming up.”
Obo paused to consider his words carefully.
“It’s a simple yes or no,” said Mandri.
Obo tilted his head back and forth as if to weigh some heavy decision.
“How should I say this...”
“By saying yes, or no.”
“I’ll say this—I am talking to you because I wish to explore the potential of our relationship.”
“Uh-huh.”
“I have no plans.”
“Now that is a lie.”
“I have no plans yet,” said Obo with a mischievous grin. “First I have to discover what Ayram wants with me.”
“Isn’t it obvious?”
“Not particularly, no.”
“These are outland pokes, Obo. What does every outland poke want? To a man and woman, they want Hrk destroyed. And you’re a Mazid. You possess the most destructive power known to man. They captured you because they want to use you against your masters. That’s why Ayram was so upset when his girl couldn’t control you.”
“If that is Ayram’s plan then it will fail and he will die. I’m certain there is more to it.”
“If that’s true, they won’t admit it to me. They won’t even tell me why I’m out here.”
“That is strange, isn't it? I’ve been trying to figure out your role in all of this. These Ayramun aren’t in a position to accommodate a freeloader, so I don’t understand why they would haul you around, or why they brought you back from the dead in the first place.”
“Probably some old desert superstition,” Mandri said, thinking back to the old demon witch who’d started this all in the first place.
“That’s what I thought too,” said Obo. “But superstition will only carry you so far with these people. I’d like to give you some advice, as a friend—try and make yourself useful. I know that will be difficult, considering your injury, but you have to try.”
“And what about you?”
“Don’t worry about me.”
Suddenly, Obo’s attention was jerked towards Minting Rock. Mandri looked and saw nothing but the rock itself—Though he knew that must be stirring because Obo could hear things, perhaps see things, that nobody else could. Mandri tried to discern if it was good or bad news by studying Obo’s gaunt face as he strained his preternatural senses. But Obo’s blank face gave nothing away unless he wanted it to. 
“The stage is set,” Obo finally said. “We will have to hold the discussion here.”Without a word of clarification, Obo stuffed the hem of his tattered robe into his mouth and stump-shuffled himself back to the spot where he lay before. He plopped himself down flat and then covered himself back up with his black tatters so that it looked like he’d never moved at all.
He gave Mandi one last whisper, muffled through folds of his robe, “Pretend that we never spoke.”
“Yeah, I gathered that.”
Then there came a loud whistle from the direction of Minting Rock, a fingers in the mouth whistle, bright as a bright-beak’s call.
A heartbeat later, and people began to tumble out from around Minting Rock’s belly. First one, then three, then seven of them, and then the giant Ayram. Each in turn took off jogging towards Mandri and the pile of dumped goods.
The first to reach him was the short, brusque man named Hill. Hill pushed Mandri over, casually ignoring Mandri’s agonized hoot. He picked up the pack that Mandri had been laying against. He then gave Mandri the most disapproving look, and he trotted back towards Minting Rock. The rest did much the same. Ayram was the only one to stay. He stood right over Mandri and his great big head and round bushy beard blotted out the sun.
Such was the man’s size that Mandri felt humbled, and humbling Mandri was no easy feat. No matter how big or intelligent someone seemed, it could never erase the fact that they were only human—an impulsive, excitable, self-interested human. Buried in the man’s shadow, Mandri looked up and saw all the familiar features of a man but did not match the pattern as a person. Ayram was greater. Somehow more solid. A reference point for being, like an old tree, or a father in the eyes of a son.
Ayram shouted, “Moto! Get over here!”
Moto was one of the Ayramun who’d been scrambling around, hauling all those packs towards Minting Rock. He was hugging a bulging sack of sand-dried beets when he heard Ayram shout his name. He immediately dropped the sack and jogged on over to see what the fuss was about.
Mandri was happy to see that Moto’s sense of control was gone. And there was a faint swipe-stain of blood from Mandri’s thigh on the shoulder of Moto’s formerly speckless garb.
“Explain,” Ayram said as he pointed to Mandri’s leg.
“It’s as I said. The boy got bit by a demon.”
“In the thigh?”
“He was trying to run away from me and he jumped into a lizard pit.”
“No I didn’t!” Mandri shouted. “The oaf threw me in!”
Ayram grunted at Mandri’s outburst, and Mandri found himself struck by a silly thought—this was the first time that Ayram had ever heard his voice. Ayram seemed to find it funny.
Ayram said to Moto, “Explain why this boy was running away from you.”
Moto shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as if he hadn’t the faintest idea. Ayram glared at him, clearly expecting an answer, so Moto prepared some bullshit about Mandri trying to escape. Mandri was familiar with the technique—when faced with real consequences, the whole body has got to get involved to sell the lie. All that powerful gesticulating, it wasn’t really about selling the lie, it was about Moto letting Ayram know that he was going to cause a fuss if he was called out on the lie, and if Ayram thought that fuss would be more trouble then the whole thing was worth, Moto might just get away with it. 
Moto finished by extending his arms all the way out to the sky and declared, “The boy’s an idiot! He doesn’t think. He’s got a dirty Spark. You should have seen it, the demon was chewing on his leg and he didn’t even try to fight the thing off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.”
Mandri knew he couldn’t speak out of turn so he was forced to resort to an incredulous gasp. With each word that Moto spoke, Mandrameen’s face scrunched up tighter and tighter—he made every effort short of squealing to let Ayram know that Moto was lying.
Ayram said to Moto, “You didn’t do what I told you to do.”
“How could I?” Moto griped. “Ask him whatever you want! The boy has no will to live.”
“We don’t have time for this. Take the Mazid.”
Moto walked slowly and deliberately to where Obo lay, pulled him up, tucked him under the arm, and then he took off towards Minting Rock, glaring at Mandri as he left.
 Ayram turned to Mandri. His arms were crossed and his fingers were tapping out his frustration against his elbows.
He said, “It was an ill omen, finding you dead in the hills. It took my witch a whole hand to convince me that your Spark was worth rekindling. When a man is brought back from the dead, sometimes, he comes back changed. Some come back corrupted. They’re agents of Shis. Is that what you are?”
The mention of Shis triggered in Mandri the memory of Salavan’s hidden basement, that black painting, and that black head. He tried to block these thoughts out of his mind because he felt that Ayram’s wild eyes were reading his thoughts.
“Can you walk?” asked Ayram.
“I can try,” Mandri answered.
Mandri rolled onto his stomach and pushed himself up onto his good knee, and from there, he stood up. His bad leg was as stiff as a board, though he was determined to walk on his own for he knew it would not go well for him if he couldn’t carry his own weight.
He took a step and shuddered.
He said, “I don’t think I can walk, but I might be able to hobble.”
Ayram nodded. “Make your way into the rock,” he said. He reached down and grabbed Mandri’s left arm and his gigantic fingers encircled the arm a whole half over. 
“It is good that you try to walk. A Shisgazok would make himself a burden.”
With Mandri steadied, Ayram let go, moved to retrieve the last items from the Ayramun’s pile, and then set off stomping, back towards Minting Rock.
Mandri hopped after him but he couldn’t keep up. His left leg still couldn’t bear even the slightest amount of weight. It felt like his thigh bone had splintered, and every shuffling hop sent sharp white shards stabbing into the meat of his thigh. But it was not a great distance, so he soldiered on.
As he went he thought of the Solitants and their sacred tortures. He wondered if they had a word for the particular arc of sensations that a demon bite inflicts. He wondered what this pain would do to him, what kind of man it would make him if he toughed it out.
He looked out over the empty Sand and recalled a heretical painting titled, ‘Oneness with the divine’. It depicted a flayed Solitant lying on a rack, his skin completely unwrapped from his body, his bare anatomy exposed to the haze of incense floating around the dark room. This mortification was a ritual performed by only the most schismatic of adherents, men and women who did not want to craft the Self, but tried instead to destroy it. The ritual was an attempt to confront the Self with the truth that there was no edge between it and the rest of reality. The logic here was as crude as the operation—as there is a natural inclination to see the skin as being the boundary of the Self, removing the skin would leave the Self with nothing to contain it.
Mandri always thought that the ecstasy depicted in Solitant's face was put there by the artist. It was not possible that a person could remain conscious through such an ordeal. And Mandri refused to accept that a ritual flensing could lead a person to righteousness. What kind of world would he be living in if that were true? Such a place could only be called Shis.
He stepped into the shadow of Minting Rock and pressed his hand against the rock’s cold belly. He pushed as hard as he could. He didn’t expect to be able to push it over, but he had to satisfy his curiosity. It really did seem that if he stood there long enough, the thing would roll over and squish him like a bug. 
The way inside was not cut into the rock itself but into the earth underneath it. This hole, this fissure, looked far too much like that drag-belly den, or rather, that demon’s den. Still, there was no way but forwards, so he hitched on downwards into the earth. This passage soon led him into a dead end of undressed stone stacked haphazardly like an old goatherd's fence. Above him, high up, was a circle of daylight. It seemed as if he were at the bottom of a dried-up well that had been carved all the way through the core of Minting Rock itself.
From above, a voice shouted, “Grab the rope!”
Mandri fumbled about in the darkness and his hand stumbled upon a rope. He took several deep breaths to battle the pain, then he held on tight as he was hauled up into the stomach of Minting Rock.</Text>

            <Title>Meskalim</Title>
            <Text>Most Outland tribes believe that when the land was pulled from the waters it came out as a solid whole, one earth surrounded by one ocean. When the sun rose it shone on everything at once—birds, bushes, beasts, and humans, as well as the twin brother gods, Solraheen and Schisol.
Schisol did not like this arrangement. Humanity was trampling all over His brother’s sacred gardens. He wanted humanity kept apart, so He smashed His fists into the ground and split the land in two. In one cataclysmic afternoon Jandri became an island continent. 
How great the trembling must have been when the Hias mountains were torn apart. How incredible it had to be to see an ocean of fish, shark, and noodly leviathan tumble into green valleys. It is said that for a day all the ocean beasts frolicked in the submerged forests and fields, and all that movement is the reason why the waters of the Shalbrum sea flows so fast today.
But Schisol was an idiot. Having pushed Jandri out into the ocean, He unwittingly pushed it closer to the sun. The unremitting heat bore down on the lush environs, withering them into dust. Only the coasts and rivers kept their watered earth. Schisol’s bid to save His brother’s garden from the ravages of humanity accidentally destroyed it. To add insult to injury, humans eventually built boats and sailed across the sea, settling Jandri and spreading out to farm every inch of arable land.
Meskalim was one of the first cities to rise up on the new continent. On the earliest maps it was nothing but a nameless black dot sitting halfway down Jandri’s western rim. Nobody cared for a small flesh market that merchant barges skipped on the way down around the horn and east to Jeket.
This all changed when a young slave girl slipped and fell into a hole. 
What that girl was doing in the foothills of the Hias mountains, so far from the city, only Solraheen knows. Some say that she was lured down into that hole by a demon, because the entrance to that void was nothing but a black sliver in the grass—impossible to find unless one knew where it was. But what’s important is that when the girl was rescued from the earth she was clutching a nugget of gold.
The shepherd who found her went back to that crack the next day with an oil lamp. Not twelve feet down and his eye caught the glint of a gold stringer slanting sideways through the granite. He followed it through a tight-fitting pocket, and there in that fracture he found a vein of gold that was wider than his arms could stretch. 
Mines were driven into the hills. This was ages before the age of Hrkan science, so no real thought was given to managing the uncountable tons of rock that were pressing down on the blooming network of tunnels. When the people of Meskalim dug into the earth they put up wood beams and packed the walls tight with a stiffening mud, but that was it. They didn’t understand that the granite there was fiercely jointed and that a beam supporting one rock might be doing nothing for another just a few inches away. It all looked like one big rock in the dim light of torches. The odd cave-in should have served as a warning. One might be tempted to say these ancient peoples didn’t understand the danger because they were blinded by greed, but the simpler truth was that they were invincibly ignorant. 
Meskalim became a golden city on the maps of a golden age. Its thousand white domes were enameled with sacred geometry. Its boulevards were filled with all the peoples of the world. Its army was twice the size of any other. Its port was the very center of the earth. 
All of this because of gold. Solraheen’s stone, called as such because gold is as bright and as immutable as the divine. Leave it in the dirt for a million years and it will stay as brilliant as the day it was interred. Roll it around in the hands and it provokes a yearning akin to spiritual rapture—a yearning for more, for as much as one can get.
The folk of Meskalim devoted their lives to it. They followed the gold wherever it went, and it went everywhere, even under the city itself. At the peak of the frenzy a person could get drunk and lost between Meskalim’s three hills, then dig straight down, and likely as not they’d pop out into a tunnel. 
One day a miner slammed his pick into the wrong hairline crack. A jet of water shot out, and the waters of the Shalbrum sea flooded in. When the thinned bedrock fell, the golden city above fell with it. More than five hundred thousand people were swallowed up in the slush of earth, though the number grew larger with each retelling.
Humans are redoubtable creatures when gold is at hand, so it didn’t take long for the city to be rebuilt from scratch further south. Meskalim the second swelled anew, though it would never be as grand as the first, for whenever a nugget of gold was pulled from the ground it was stored in a dockside warehouse before being shipped across the sea or down and around to Jeket. Folks feared the earth might open up at any time to eat their treasures, so common sense demanded that the wealth would be better used elsewhere.
And so, for a thousand years, Meskalim’s temple was poor and its people poorer. Its streets weren’t laid out with any sense, much less paved, and these mucky avenues didn’t adhere to the natural contours of the land because when someone wanted to build a house they simply plopped it down wherever inspiration struck. And these houses were ugly things, shouldn’t be called houses—they were dwellings, crumpled slugs of mud, lumber, and straw with windowless walls all askew. There wasn’t a true roof beam in all the lower city. A horde of these things were smashed up against each other like one big deposit of mud that the Istil wind had just happened to blow together.
Mandri couldn’t stand the sight of it unless he was deep in a burgeon binge.
Unfortunately, he had to pace his beer because he couldn’t afford to be so run through that he couldn’t walk. He had to feather the beer’s effect, take sips from his beer-skin every hundred staggered steps or so to keep himself bouncing off that point of no return. It was a dangerous game, taking off the edge in chunks, but it was one he was determined to play to avoid thinking about that witchy bitch’s bloody, haunting face.
The constant patter of a wispy rain was helping to keep him grounded. And, dare he think it, Meskalim looked somehow pretty in the gray light of a sun shining through rain clouds. But surely, this beauty was the work of the burgeons. Mandri had seen his reflection in a puddle, and his pupils were blown so wide that the smallest slight of light could get in there, bounce around, and blind him to all ugliness. Every surface sparkled. The falling rain dazzled. Even the cool muck welling up between his toes as he splashed along Meskalim’s streets was flecked with radiant light.
The more Mandri drank, the more the burgeonsight played with light and wetness. It seemed as if the sparkling bits of light themselves were tangible, like he could get them glommed up between his fingertips and lick them. Perhaps this oily celestial film that coated every surface was always there—it took burgeonsight to see it.
He lingered in the middle of an empty crossroads, surrounded by some of the blobbiest mud-caked slums in all of Meskalim. Each roof was topped off with little nipple chimneys and there wasn’t a wooden door in sight—only rags hanging down to cover their lamplit, onion-smelling, fly-biting interiors. Mandrameen stood, motionless, back hunched, hair drenched, brown robe slipping off his shoulder, for he was struck dumb by the sight of his own hand.
He held it up and studied it. His own skin was sparkling. In the hollow of his palm was a pool of that starry substance. He tried to touch the little sparkles, tried to rub them off, but that was no good because his fingers were sparkling too. This wasn’t merely wetness, he was sure of it.
He licked his index finger and a heavenly sensation flooded into his mouth. It was a tingling flavor that tasted like honey mixed with the vigor of youth. It tasted like the smell of a field of wildflowers. It tasted like apple-juice mixed with god.
He squealed with delight. 
He bent down and scraped up a dollop of mud with his finger, then licked it. Again, his mouth was flooded with the flavor. 
He rushed over to the nearest mud-caked wall, where an awning protected some large clay pots from the rain. He knelt down and licked the handles, the rims, the bodies. Again he tasted that divine flavor. There was a little brown pup shivering behind one of these pots, and Mandri picked the little beast up by its scruff and licked it, and it, too, tasted of heaven.
He dropped the pup and opened his mouth to the sky and tried to lick the air to check if the air itself was suffused with this substance. His tongue was caught mid-curl when a disgusted voice shot out of the rain, saying, “Get lost you freak!”
Mandri spun around, feet sliding in the mud. He raised his hands to defend himself, but there was no one there, nothing but glistening mounds of mud, soggy rags, and the sound of rain plunking off the broken clay pots that piled up in every nook and cranny.
Mandri couldn’t see the Meskalimi eyes peeping out at him, but he could damn well feel them. These destitutes were hiding in their hovels of slop and they were judging him.
Them judging him.
They could not see what he saw. Their dim-sighted eyes could only see a too-skinny young man standing in the muck, hackles raised, licking the air like a maniac.
“You do not see what I see!” Mandri shouted.
“Get lost!”
 Mandri spun around again, trying to place the voice, then hissed when he realized there might be more than one of them speaking out.
“I see Solraheen’s light!” he shouted.
A spindly hand brushed aside the raggedy curtain hanging in the nearest doorway. Standing there was a dark man holding a hammer. 
“GET LOST!”
Mandri yelped and took off running.
He ran and ran, following the road wherever it was going. He stopped when he realized that he was liable to slip and crack his skull. He also realized he’d dropped his beer-skin somewhere along the way. He thought about going back and trying to find it, but that wasn’t possible, because he didn’t know where he was and what paths he’d taken to get here. 
There is one way to orient oneself inside Meskalim—memorize all the faces of Meskalim’s central hill. The hill towered over the rumps and clumps of mud that was the city proper. The hill itself was studded with proper white buildings, each clinging to the hill like barnacles on a washed up corpse. These were the various offices of the Hrkan government, as well as the mansions of the people who staffed them. It just so happened that when Mandri looked up at Meskalim’s hill, he was looking at the house of Salavan Soreen. Salavan was the city’s self-serving governor. His house was famous and hated, for it claimed a privileged vista at the top of the hill’s southern cliff face. Its wide balcony leered over the rest of the city below, and over Mandri, reminding him what he was supposed to be doing. 
He set off at a stuttering trot.
Along the way he stole a knife, because who leaves a stout little knife laying outside in a bowl of kakanut shells? Someone who wants it stolen, that’s who. Mandri simply complied. He also needed it more, so by divine right it was his. 
He knotted the knife up in the folds of his robe that hung loose around his waist, and he found that if he bent forward a bit, then the bulge of the knife’s handle would get lost amongst the folds. So he walked, stooping a little, all the way up Meskalim’s hill. It was hard trudging. His legs were completely out of wire when he came upon Salavan’s house. The damned thing was surrounded by a monstrous white wall. If he was going to kill Meskalim’s governor, he needed it to move.
Mandri hated walls. He’d always believed that walls had gone too far beyond their original scope. The first walls were knee-high stacks of stones set out in pastures to mark boundaries between goat herds—a pure and wholesome purpose. This wall, Salavan’s wall, was among the most perverse. It was huge, four-men tall, and its purpose was to stand there and look daunting so that poor people didn’t get any ideas. Most walls that big in a place as wet as Meskalim are streaked with black and yellow grime dripping to the street, but Salavan’s wall was pristine. Its plaster was as smooth and as white as the day it was slathered on. No doubt Salavan spent more money cleaning that wall than he spent on bread for widows and orphans, or for anything for anyone. That wall was more important than human life, more important than Mandri’s life. That wall’s raw materials could buy at least fifty Mandrameens. Its maintenance? At least five Mandris a year.
At least this wall was doing a job in keeping him out. Some walls on the lower rungs of Meskalim’s hill couldn’t keep out a flying shit. They’re purely decorative. Imagine that—a decorative wall—it’s not even trying to fend off the poor sand starving, all it's doing is letting them know they aren’t wanted.
Mandri stood in front of Salavan’s wall like an idiot. The burgeonsight was warping all the little dimples and scratches and faint finger-drags that were imprinted in the plaster. Mandri couldn’t shake the feeling that the wall was daring him, like a schoolyard bully, to just try to breach it and see what happens.
There was a squared-out arch in the middle of this wall, and underneath this arch was an ironwood gate guarded by two thugs on either side. These brawny men were huddled close to the gate so as to squeeze themselves inside the narrow shelter of the arch. It wasn’t doing them much good. They were as sodden as Mandri. Like everything else, the burgeonsight was making them sparkle. That didn’t stop them from looking like demons.
In the best of light, a Meskalimi thug’s face is an unsettling thing. A lifetime of trading violence for money fixes a man’s expression into a state of permanent concern, and once the brow and cheek gets slashed with scars, the whole thing takes on a look of putrefied misery. Blur that face a little with rain, twist it a little with burgeonsight, and now it’s a demon’s face that could bend the bravest spine. And that’s what Mandri saw when he looked at those two thugs guarding Salavan’s gate, he saw full-blooded demons.
And they had swords—short, street-wise swords clipped high up on the belt.
Mandri believed that his burgeonsight, waning though it was, revealed the truth and showed these ‘men’ for what they were—actual demons. They couldn’t be full-fledged demons, because such demons should be tasked with more important things than watching a gate. They would be greasing the feet of backsliding priests, or tricking young beauties into thinking that taking it up the bum doesn’t count.
It then occurred to Mandri that he didn’t know why he was actually going through with all this. Ostensibly, he was here to placate the fury of a demon witch, but until this moment, standing in front of this stupid white wall, he hadn’t actually considered the possibility of not showing up. Pel had told him to go and see Salavan, and now here he was, seeing about Salavan. 
Perhaps he wasn’t fully in control of his own faculties.
Perhaps Pel had puppeteered him.
Or perhaps it was the burgeons.
One of the demons peeked out from under the arch and shouted, “Hey—scram, boy!”
“Git yous butt gawn,” the other said. His vowels were as stubborn as a mule.
Do demons have regional accents?
It sounded like this demon grew up in a sun-slum near Iskabat.
The first demon had no doubt crawled out of a Jeketian gutter, for his lilt and swagger could only have come from someone steeped in the capital of the Hrkan world.
Mandri caught his wits and said, “I’m here to see Salavan Soreen.”
The two demons looked at each other. A whispered word was shared.
The first of them asked, “Why?”
The other asked, “Whatchu gawtta knife fur?”
Mandri looked down and saw that he was gripping his knife so tight that his knuckles were white. 
“Oh...uh…sorry.”
The demon from Iskabat pulled his short sword from its scabbard and he brandished it at Mandri. 
He said, “Cuhm an get dem feengahs cut.”
Mandri stepped back and waved his hands in clear submission. He said, “I’m here because Pel sent me.”
“Pel sent you?” the Jeketian demon asked.
Mandri nodded.
“What’s your name?”
“Mandrameen.”
The Iskabati demon grunted and the Jeketian slouched back against the gate. Evidently, they had been expecting him.
The Iskabati waved his sword and said, “Poop thuh lil’ hippy.”
“What?”
“Drop the knife,” said the Jeketian.
“Why?”
“Are you dumb? You’re not getting inside with a knife.”
It seemed unwise to give up the knife. If Mandri handed it over and passed through the gate he’d be ambling into the clutches of a Salavan without the means to defend himself.
Probably, he would die. 
But what good was a Mandri wielded knife against a demon king?
He’d die with or without it.
He could run away.
But where would he go? He would probably die in a gutter within a week.
If there were alternative options, Mandri couldn’t see them because burgeonsight has a rooting effect, it roots a person into the present, makes it hard to see into the future. There were an infinite number of possible paths his life’s direction could take, and presumably some of these didn’t lead to a quick death. Burgeonsight narrowed it down to just one—go through the gate.
Some people say that this is why burgeons are bad for a person’s Spark. They say that burgeons make people ignorant of the future and so they don’t plan for it, and the next thing that happens is a ruined life. Mandri would argue that everyone walks through life’s infinite possibilities with their eyes set on a narrow array of options, so if sober people are ignoring an effective infinity, what’s the harm in taking a burgeon to ignore a couple more? At least he wasn’t trying to build walls, those literal embodiments of the restriction of possibility. What’s worse than burgeons is building a wall and funneling only the ‘good’ things through the gate. These people are higher on fear than Mandri had ever been on burgeons.
He dropped the knife.
The Hrkan demon opened the gate’s cutout door and motioned Mandri in.
The door clanged behind him, and a shiver ran through his spine.
It’s amazing how fast he could come to regret a decision.</Text>

She was not alone. Stumbling along behind her was a Jandri girl wrapped in a mottled, brown blanket. She leaned against Elrahet’s stooped back, and the pair moved with deliberate care as the girl was clearly drugged, or drunk. Mandri guessed drunk because she walked with that familiar rhythmless, scuffing, shuffle of blurred instinct. She would have fallen at least twice if Elrahet was not there to steady the load. The third time, Elrahet shrugged and let the girl fall.
“Toughen up!” the old woman snipped as the girl caught herself on hand and knee.
When this girl looked up her eyes locked on the Mazid, and her chin jerked up. The sun’s light revealed to all a sickly pale face, which is no small thing for a Jandri girl reddened by kell oil and the sun. Her high and narrow cheeks were troubled by a huge mess of tousled brown hair and a clear lack of sleep, though her dark eyes were set in cold resolve as she fought back a grimace as she stood back up. Huddled up as she was under the blanket, the source of her pain was not clear.
Ayram grabbed the girl’s shoulder and pulled her up straight. He shook her gently, and he called her name to bring her to attention. 

His dismissiveness enraged the girl. She tossed off her blanket, and along with it went any sign of the lethargy and pain which plagued her features.




But it was Obo who finally broke the indecision. 


“So then,  who is it you want me to kill?” Obo asked.
“A  god-swallower. The demon of demons. A beast called the Amalgamete.”

            <Title>Fundamentalism</Title>
            <Text>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamentalist%E2%80%93modernist_controversy

By 1905, Bryan had concluded that Darwinism and the modernism of Higher Criticism were allies in promoting liberalism within the church, thereby in his view undermining the foundations of Christianity. In lectures from 1905, Bryan spoke out against the spread of Darwinism, which he characterized as involving &quot;the operation of the law of hate – the merciless law by which the strong crowd out and kill off the weak&quot;, and warned that it could undermine the foundations of morality. 

At a time of widespread revulsion at alleged German atrocities, Bryan linked evolution to Germany,[9] and claimed that Darwinism provided a justification for the strong to dominate the weak and was therefore the source of German militarism.[10] He drew on reports by the entomologist Vernon Kellogg of German officers discussing the Darwinian rationale for their declaration of war,[11] and the sociologist Benjamin Kidd's book The Science of Power which contended that Nietzsche's philosophy represented an interpretation of Darwinism,[10] to conclude that Nietzsche's and Darwin's ideas were the impetus for German nationalism and militarism. Bryan argued that Germany's militarism and &quot;barbarism&quot; came from their belief that the &quot;struggle for survival&quot; described in Darwin's On the Origin of Species applied to nations as well as to individuals,[10] and that &quot;The same science that manufactured poisonous gases to suffocate soldiers is preaching that man has a brute ancestry and eliminating the miraculous and the supernatural from the Bible.&quot;[11] 

Bryan was, in essence, fighting what would later be called social Darwinism,[12] social and economic ideas owing as much to Herbert Spencer and Thomas Malthus as to Darwin, and viewed by modern biologists as a misuse of his theory.[13] Germany, or so Bryan's argument ran, had replaced Christ's teachings with Nietzsche's philosophy based on ideas of survival of the fittest, and the implication was that America would suffer the same fate if unchecked.[9] This fear was reinforced by the report of the psychologist James H. Leuba's 1916 study indicating that a considerable number of college students lost their faith during the four years they spent in college. 

Bryan launched his campaign against Darwinism in 1921 when he was invited to give the James Sprunt Lectures at Virginia's Union Theological Seminary. At the end of one, The Menace of Darwinism, he said that &quot;Darwinism is not a science at all; it is a string of guesses strung together&quot; and that there is more science in the Bible's &quot;And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature ...&quot;[14] than in all of Darwin.[15] These lectures were published and became a national bestseller.
Now that Bryan had linked Darwinism and Higher Criticism as the twin evils facing the Presbyterian Church, Harry Emerson Fosdick responded by defending Darwinism, as well as Higher Criticism, from Bryan's attack. In the early 1920s, Bryan and Fosdick squared off against each other in a series of articles and replies in the pages of the New York Times.

Although the prosecution of Scopes was successful, the trial is widely seen as a crucial moment in discrediting the fundamentalist movement in America, particularly after Darrow called Bryan to the stand and he appeared little able to defend his view of the Bible.
Among the media, Bryan's loudest and ultimately most influential critic was H. L. Mencken, who reported on the trial in his columns and denounced fundamentalism as irrational, backwards and intolerant.
As noted earlier, opposition to Darwinism was always much more important to Bryan than it was to other conservative Presbyterian Church leaders. Thus, following Bryan's death in 1925, the debate about evolution, while it remained an issue within church politics, never again assumed the prominence to the debate that it had while Bryan was alive. (Probably the reason why the issue of evolution has obtained such an iconic status within the popular consciousness about the fundamentalist–modernist controversy is that it represented the one point where internal church politics intersected with government, specifically public school, policy.)


The dispute between the fundamentalists and modernists would be played out in nearly every Christian denomination. By the 1920s, it was clear that every mainstream Protestant denomination was going to be willing to accommodate modernism, with the exception of the Presbyterians, Southern Baptists, and the Missouri synod Lutherans, where the situation was still unclear. The departure of Machen and other conservatives brought the Presbyterians into the camp willing to accommodate modernism, leaving the Southern Baptists and the Missouri Synod as the only large, national denominations where orthodox Protestants were still active within the denomination. The conflict continued to roil both churches for most of the 20th century and the triumph of orthodox Protestantism in those denominations would not be secure until the Seminex schism in the Lutheran church and the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence of 1979–1990. 

Critics of the takeover faction assert that the &quot;civil war&quot; among Southern Baptists has been about power lust and right-wing secular politics. Russell H. Dilday, president of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary from 1978 to 1994, has analogized what he calls &quot;the carnage of the past quarter century of denominational strife in our Baptist family&quot; to &quot;friendly fire&quot; where casualties come as a result of the actions of fellow Baptists, not at the hands of the enemy. He writes that &quot;Some of it has been accidental, &quot; but that &quot;some has been intentional.&quot; He characterizes the struggle as being &quot;far more serious than a controversy, &quot; but rather a &quot;self-destructive, contentious, one-sided feud that at times took on combative characteristics.&quot;[40]
Former president of the SBC Jimmy R. Allen writes that the resurgence/takeover leaders searched for a battle cry to which Baptists would respond. They found it in the fear that we were not &quot;believing the Bible.&quot; They focused on the few who interpreted the Bible more liberally and exaggerated that fact. Allen's assessment is that &quot;It was like hunting rabbits with howitzers. They destroyed more than they accomplished.&quot;[39]

In 2019, after the scandals of sexual abuse accusations involving Paul Pressler and sexual abuse cover-ups involving Paige Patterson, the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary removed the stained glass windows depicting the actors of the conservative resurgence, located in the MacGorman Chapel and opened in 2011. [42]

            <Text>A man who expects too much sets out into the Sand alone. Unbeknown to him, a woman who expects too little sets out from the opposite direction. The two travelers happen to cross paths in the shifting middle of the Sand’s Empty Portion. They are hundreds of leagues from any farm or road, hundreds of years from anyone ever setting foot in that spot of the world again. It’s an unlikely convergence in space and time, in the most inhospitable desert, yet the man who expects too much will doubt the significance of this meeting. He actually expects to find a bit of strangeness out in the great sand sea—after all, the desert is large but the world is small and full of chance encounters. 
He looks at the woman who he has stumbled upon and all he can see is the fulfillment of expectation. That is all it is to the man who expects too much. No need to invoke the name of Solraheen.
The other traveler, the woman who expects too little, she is stunned by the significance of the moment. She did not expect to see another person in a place where no one else should be. After all, this part of the Sand is large and full of nothing. For this to happen, for two Sparks to meet in such a wasteland without intending to, well, it could not be a simple coincidence. She and he must have been brought together for some purpose.
Overwhelmed by this glimpse of the divine plan, she turns her eyes to the heavens and invokes the name of Solraheen.
The story ends there. It is nine long lines in the original Old Jandri script, nine lines scratched into an old clay tablet the size of a washing board. Some say the ending is missing, that there is another tablet hidden in a secret vault of some ancient city buried by time, waiting for providence to be revealed. Solitants preach that there must be another tablet, one which proves that the story is about Solraheen Himself. They say Solraheen is the man who expects too little. The woman is his bride. It is the story of their meeting.
But what do they know?
They’re freaks. Maybe that man was just a man and the woman was just a woman and that’s all there is to it. That’s what Seb Ugluu believed. Sometimes he’d dare to venture even further and say that the man and woman never existed at all and that the story is a fable.
He’d tell anyone who’d listen to his liquored up sermons that this story, the raw events, were not important. What was important was the lesson, and there was a lesson in those nine lines, a lesson that’s made easier to see by asking a few simple questions:
 What would have happened if the woman had journeyed into the desert and made it through safely without encountering a soul? 
Absolutely nothing. 
And if nothing had happened, would she have glimpsed the divine plan? 
Absolutely not.
She would have trudged along the ridges of the ergs, her shoulder set against the wind, and she wouldn’t have given a single thought to Solraheen except to pray for her safety.
She never would have been overwhelmed by His mysteries.
She never would have shed a tear at the wonder of chance.
She never would have turned her eyes to the heavens and laced His name with magnificence.
And yet, Solraheen would have been there all the same.
“That’d be the lesson,” Seb would say. Solraheen’s hand is there and it is always there. It is there in the meeting, and it is there in the absence of it. It is there in the pain, and it is there in the pleasure. To be struck dumb by the sight of His plan in one case and not the other is the same as to not see the plan at all. 
The key was to avoid expectations. Expectations turn the vividness of the present moment into an ignorable blur. 
Seb liked to put it a little more bluntly, “Expectations will get ya up the ass.”
He said it, and that’s how it was.
Of course, none of this stopped him from having expectations himself. No one is perfect. Not even Solraheen.
Seb was something of a master of low expectations, because thirty years of living in a desert land that most languages call Emptiness made it easy to keep expectations as low as possible.
Like clouds. Seb did not expect to see clouds. This close to the coast one might have expected to see a bit of moisture pluming the sky but Seb knew better. He knew how the Hias mountains shadowed the Junei hills from rain, how the Istil wind was too weak to carry water up and over those peaks. It was strange because the Hias were hardly mountains at all. The Burgos mountains, those were mountains, fully grown mountains with bald heads and stern granite faces frowning at pilgrims passing by. The Hias were nothing but big mounds of dirt pimpled with boulders. Chins tufted with thornscrub. It seemed like even the weakest watering wind should be able to make it up and over them.
The winds used to be able to do it, in some ancient age. The evidence was there in the foothills. He’d walked the ridges of the Hias and he’d looked east towards the Junei Plain where he could see the lighter orange clay of long-dried washes snaking through the red foothills for as far as there were foothills.
Of course, when he was down in those foothills he never noticed the washes. Down there he’d only see sun baked clay and that clay is so hard that he couldn’t imagine it had ever seen rain. One night, Seb spit on the ground and when he woke, five whole hands later, that glob of spit was still there. The ground was so hard his spit couldn’t seep into it. Some of that might have to do with the fact that Seb’s spit was thick and sticky from all the borcandi spines he chewed, but still, it proved the point. It was like the ground had been dry for so long that it didn’t want to get wet. Like that story of the lonesome spearman who’d been at war for so long that when he returned home to the kindness of his wife he killed her. Just couldn’t deal with a good loving. The Hias hills were like that. A lot of the Sand was like that. Hateful. Nothing lived in it.
Absolutely nothing.
There were lizards, but lizards were everywhere so they didn’t count. Piss on a rock, any rock, and some little lizard will scuttle out from nowhere to sip the urine. 
Birds don’t count either because they’re only passing through. 
Beetles could be found by ripping the waxy bark off bamber trees. Sometimes Seb would have to bore all the way into the tree’s stringy, yellow core to find them. But green crust beetles don’t count as ‘something’. The problem with them is their shells guard a smell that makes the stomach curl, and that smell can’t be boiled or steamed, so they aren’t good eating, and as far as Seb was concerned, if it’s not good eating it might as well not exist. The only things worth paying any mind are things that kill and the things that keep him alive.
Everything else is nothing. 
There’s men out in the Sand, but men are boring. There’s women, but that’s all Seb would say about them—they’re out there. There were other things too, but mostly there was nothing. 
That’s what Seb saw as he stood atop one of the Junei foothills and looked out over the red and empty Junei plain—he saw nothing. Mostly he saw nothing because his eyes weren’t good at seeing way far out. It was mostly a blur. But even if he could see he knew there wouldn’t be a horizon because it’d be lost in the shimmer of a mirage, the kind that looks like water only it's not. A mirage was the perfect metaphor for how Seb viewed the Sand, because it looked like something, but really it was nothing.
Lots and lots of nothing.
“Ey, Seb! There's somethin ‘ere!”
Seb’s ears pricked at the words. The shout had come from a nearby ravine.
Quick and spry as a lizard zipped up on freeweed, Seb scrambled over to the lip of that ravine and peered down into its deep belly. 
One of his fellows was standing there in the middle of it. All the Ayramun were swaddled from head to toe in brown or black wool dusted red by clay, but Seb knew it was Gugi down there because of the way he stood. Only Seb and Gugi stood with that twitchy restlessness that marks out a Jandri man who’s not stopped chewing the spines of borcandi leaves since the day they were weaned off the tit. And Gugi was also a little taller than most. A little lankier. 
Gugi stuck his skinny arm up in the air and waved it towards Seb.
Seb sneered at the eagerness.
“Put your goddamned hand down,” Seb shouted. “I can see ya just fine.”
“Then get your ass down here!” Gugi shouted back.
Seb harrumphed, then started his climb down into the ravine.
As far as ravines go it seemed as full of nothing as any other ravine. It was steeper than most, and it was dry and dusty so Seb struggled to find purchase on the slope. He was forced into a clumsy half-scramble-half-slide to get down the bottom, which was about thirty yards down. Once there he took a moment to shake out the dirt that had fallen into his left boot.
The unexpected thing about this ravine was how even and straight it was, almost like a road. It went straight as an arrow for a full fifty yards before getting lost around a bend. This run was speckled with the dried out husks of karkle bushes. They looked like big black hairballs. Gugi was standing in front of one of them, looking a little spooked.
Seb took his time ambling on over. He fingered a fresh borcandi spine out of his sleeve pocket as he went. He knew there wouldn’t be anything worth noticing because Gugi had a penchant for pointing out any old thing that caught his interest. Maybe there’d be a pricked-up drag-belly hissing inside that bush, but fat little lizards doing four-legged push-ups and flashing their ruddy throats weren’t worth shouting about. 
They weren’t something.
They were to be expected.
Part of the ignorable blur.
Gugi urged him on with an impatient flap of his hand. 
Seb laughed and said, “I ain’t gonna run in this heat.”
Gugi shook his head and mumbled something Seb couldn’t hear. 
“Pipe down, white light, I’m comin’.”
Seb eyed the karkle bush. There was definitely something hidden underneath its twiggy branches. A lumpy shape of something shadowed. A creature of some sort. Big, dark, unmoving, and apparently unconcerned with how Gugi was brushing the karkle’s branches aside to get a better look. 
“What is it?” Seb asked as he crouched next to Gugi.
“See for yourself,” Gugi squaked as he parted the bush’s brambles.
Seb peered down into the bush’s shadow. His jaw went slack in surprise, and his barely-chewed borcandi spine slipped from his lip.
There was a goddamned dead body underneath that bush.
“Shit.”
“Ain’t it?” Gugi said, eyes open wide in frightened wonder. “Ya know, this is the first bush I looked under.”
“No. The first one?”
“Yep. It’s the first bush I looked under. I was like, this bush is in the perfect position, halfway-up, halfway-down, bet it will be the best spot to—”
“You sayin’ this is the first bush you looked under?”
“Yep.”
Gugi’s eyes weren’t lying. It was the first bush he’d looked under. There were at least forty other bushes in that dusty ravine, and the first one Gugi looks under has got a dead body in it. A quick glance around told Seb it was probably the only one that had a dead body in it.
This was really something.
A strange coincidence.
A divine sign.
Seb’s skin prickled.
He picked up his dropped chew and popped it back into his mouth, and resumed his chewing with zeal. It was a little sandy, but Seb wasn’t going to waste a spine. Spines helped him think. They helped him find reasonable conclusions.
This could be a prank.
He eyed Gugi with suspicion.
Gugi was a prankster, had a prankster’s face—thin, a long crooked nose, restless eyes, bad skin, mostly it was in the way he chewed his spines, open-mouthed, provocative, sigh-smiling. It was nasty, the way he chewed, because the man’s teeth were rubbed down to black and yellow nubs. Seb’s teeth were like that too, but he had the good sense to keep his mouth shut. Even when he talked, his lips worked hard to conceal the graveyard in his mouth.
Gugi said, “Ain’t no blood. And it don’t smell.”
Seb looked down, and yep, there weren’t no blood. And yep, it didn’t smell.
Gugi started playing a game of point-and-see, like he was want to do.
“Got an arm,” he said. “A white tunic of somewhat. Skin don’t look too dried out none. Skinny, though. Look like he got black paint on his finger.”
Seb squatted down to get away from Gugi’s inane observations. He peered under the low brim of the karkle’s branches.
“Gotta be a man,” he said.
“We sure he’s dead?”
“He’s not nappin’.”
Gugi squatted down next to Seb. “Help me get him out,” he said.
Seb asked, “Did you put this body here?”
“What? No.”
“Gugi. I’m only gonna ask one more time. Did you put this dead body here?”
Seb couldn’t read Gugi’s face. The man was so well practiced in deceit. Only sometimes did Gugi’s eyes gave things away, and this wasn’t one of those times.
Gugi said, “You think I’d kidnap some random bit, haul his ass all the way out here, then kill him and stuff him up under this bush, just to stir you up?”
His eyes weren’t telling.
Sometimes, if Seb paused and stared hard at Gugi, the guilt would get to him, and he’d give it up. 
“I didn’t do shit! Damn. I found it here like I said.”
“Then who put it here?” Seb said. “The body is fresh as a baby’s bum. You think he just crawled up under here all by himself?”
“Could be. He’s prolly some pilgrim that was headed for the pass. Crawled up under here to seek shade and forgot to wake up.”
“If that’s what happened, it’s even worse.”
“Why’s that?”
“Because it means a god put him here. Or a demon. It’s providence, one way or the other. Could be curse.”
“It ain’t no curse. It’s just a dead body.”
“There’s no such thing as ‘just a dead body’. This goes with what I been sayin’ this whole time—we shouldn’t be settin’ up a damn ambush in these damn hills.”
“Seb, if it’s a curse, then let’s move this curse somewhere else. I aim to use this bush. It’s the perfect spot.”
Seb couldn’t believe his ears. “You gonna hide in this bush?”
“I am,” said Gugi, without a hint of trepidation.
“You gonna hide in the one bush that’s got a dead body in it?”
“There won’t be no dead body when we move it. That’s why I need your help. Damn.” 
&quot;Have you lost your water? This the clearest shout of a cursed bush I ever heard. And more in point of fact, Ayram ought to hear about this. ‘Cause if this is the place where—&quot;
&quot;Don't worry Ayram ‘bout this shit. Just help me move the damn thing.”
“Gugi, how do you not see what’s goin’ on here?”
“Grab his foot.”
“Gugi, listen to me—This is Solraheen tellin’ you that if you hide in this bush, then you gonna die.”
“Grab his foot.”
“No.”
“I grab one, you grab the other.”
Gugi reached down and took a firm grip of the dead left ankle. He stared at Seb and shook it around to show Seb just how tightly he was holding on without getting struck down by some maleficent bolt. The foot wasn’t too stiff on the ankle. The body hadn’t been dead too long.
“Now grab the other foot.&quot;
Seb shook his head. 
Gugi said, “You know this body here—this body is the perfect chance for you to get to bother Elrahet.”
“How’s that?”
“You don’t think an old witch don’t want to look over a dead body? I bet you bring a dead body with you, and now you got something to pester her with instead of your boring old self. Put a dead body next to her, and she ain’t gonna be able to shoo you away.”
“Maybe,” Seb said hesitantly.
“Help me carry the boy to Elrahet, and I’ll give you twenty spines.”
The furrow in Seb’s brow softened. “Twenty?”
Gugi nodded. “Twenty.”
Twenty was a lot of spines. A couple weeks worth. There was no telling when they’d be back in the putty hills and he could pick another fill.
“How about it?” Gugi asked.
“Alright.”
Seb bent down to grab the other foot of the corpse, but Gugi brushed him away, saying, “I’ll make it forty spines if you carry it yourself.”
“You ain’t got forty spines.”
“I’ll give you twenty spines, and my God’s Eye burgeons.”
“Give me twenty spines, and you tell me where you get your God’s Eye burgeons.”
“No chance. It’s twenty and the burgeons, and you carry this bit all the way to Ayram. Besides, it's a limp body. It's easier if just one of us carries him.”
“And how’d you come to figure that?”
“It’s a limp body. Throwin’ it over the shoulders is easier than one man gets legs, one man gets arms.”
“If it’s easier for one person, then what you call me over for?”
“Because I don’t wanna carry it.”
Seb’s brow tightened up again, and he asked, “Why not?”
Gugi smiled. “Because it’s cursed,” he said.
This was why no one liked Gugi—he was never upfront about the way things were. He’d betray anyone he could, if anyone ever thought to trust him.
Seb nearly slapped him. “You thought you could get me to take up this cursed body for a measly twenty spines and some God’s Eye burgeons?”
“Am I wrong?”
Gugi’s face twisted into that annoying, presumptuous grin. Seb wanted nothing more than to break some of Ayram’s rules on that grin, but he thought better of it. Best thing to do was to take the grand scheme of things into account.
There was a cursed body under a bush, where no cursed body should be. 
Maybe he was looking at this all wrong.
Maybe that body wasn’t cursed.
Solraheen’s hand is there in the pain, and it’s there in the pleasure. 
Another way of putting that is to say that a curse could be a blessing, and a blessing could be a curse. There’s no way of knowing which is which until it all plays out. It’s expectations that get in the way of the truth. If he looked at all this with no expectations, and abstracted out the deadness of the body from the strangeness of the circumstances, then no doubt he would take Gugi’s deal. God’s Eye burgeons for a little bit of toil? 
The best thing to do was to take the deal.
He said to Gugi, “You ain’t wrong, but dammit, you know I’m gonna kill you someday.” 
“Sure thing, Seb.”
“Before we do anythin’, you’re gonna gimme them burgeons.”
“I’ll give you the spines now, and the burgeons later.”
“Burgeons now, spines later.”
Gugi sighed, then pulled out a leather pouch from his robe and tossed it to Seb. Seb caught it, checked it, pocketed it, and then he crouched down, reached under the karkle’s twigs, grabbed both the boy’s dead ankles, and pulled.
The body slid right out. It was half as heavy as Seb thought it’d be.
“He’s young,” said Gugi.
“Looks soft,” said Seb.
The boy was as skinny as a kid half his age, and he was clothed in nothing but a ragged white tunic smeared with dust and clay. Judging by the skin, the whites of the eyes, the limp limbs, it really did seem like he’d only died that morning.
Seb grabbed the boy’s right arm and pulled it up and over his shoulder, and the rest of the body came with it. Seb settled the weight, just like he’d do for a poached lizard, and before he left, he hocked up a huge wad of spit, and spat it at Gugi’s feet.
“Sorry ‘bout that.” he said.
He didn’t stick around for Gugi’s mocking laugh. He headed back west, towards the Junei pass, towards the cliff where Ayram and his nearest were planning out the ambush that would hopefully end all their ambushes for good.

            <Text>If Mandri had a kind bone in his body he would have shared a shoulder in comfort, and he would have told her that, no, it’s not your fault. But it was her fault. It was everyone’s fault but if she’d been able to control Obo from the start, then surely, it wouldn’t have come to this.

And now Mandri was alone with the witch and Ayram’s dead body. He had no allegiances here. He stood up and joined the others.
“Stop!” Elrahet shouted.

The spreading pool of bile reached her toes. She sighed and said, “I know this might end wrong, but I’m tired. I’ve been fighting for too long—longer than any of you. I can’t fight any longer. It’s either this…or I won’t…it must be this.” 

Obo wrapped twisted his left arm up in the rag and used it like a club to wipe his face. “I remember proposing something to that effect,” he said, “But I thought I was refused.”
“I have accepted.”
“Both parties have to accept—isn’t that how a deal works?” He flashed a deadly serious face in between wipes.

 “Why would I do that? I don’t want to kill any of you. We might not have made a deal, but there is a deal here to be made.” 

“Tell me,” said Elrahet, “If you had a good reason to free Solraheen, would you do it?”
Obo thought for a moment and said, “I can only think of one good reason—I would free Solraheen in exchange for the knowledge of the Spark.”

Mandri looked for clarity in the faces of the Ayramun, but they were each as confused as he.
“Hurry!” Elrahet called. “The Hrks still hunt us!”
Mandri was the first to move, for he very much wanted to know what Elrahet was on about. It was clear she possessed a secret knowledge, and maybe more. If she truly knew how the world was made, then perhaps she could explain a whole lot more than that. She might explain all of life’s absurdities—why he felt like he’d been saved for something, why he wanted to know anything at all, why he wanted what he wanted, and why he despised everything else. All of this, surely, could be explained by this crotchety old witch named Elrahet. He ran after her, but first he stopped to retrieve his pack.
Obo asked Mandri for a helping hand, for old times sake. Mandri didn’t dare refuse, and so he let the Mazid squeeze himself back onto the litter.
Moto, Moteah, and Purl shared a hushed conversation, and eventually they took up their packs and joined up with Mandri and Elrahet, bearing with them a trio of torches.

            <Title>White Tails</Title>
            <Text>The next morning they came across a herd of white-tails one-thousand strong. More commonly known as poop-tails, or piss-tails. Mandri asked Obo why they shat on their tails, because Obo had an answer for everything. Obo said that when it gets too hot—and it always gets too hot—white-tail lizards cup their webbed hind feet and then evacuate their cloacal contents onto them, allowing them to rub their tails in it, and they do this so that when they raise their tails into the air and open them up like sails, the liquid from their piss-shit gets sucked up by the sun, and in so doing, it draws the heat from the body.
Seb overheard this explanation and said, “Like garglin’ piss to wet the throat.”
Mandri didn’t even cringe at the thought. When the heat dries out the throat it gets scratchy. This time spent in the wilderness had acquainted him well with his body’s functions, because the body is all there was. By now, nothing about it was disgusting.
Mandri worried that if he found Seb’s behavior to be tolerable, he himself must look outlandish. Yes, he was turning into a regular poke in sight and mind. Solraheen knows he slathered on enough kell oil to look the part.</Text>

            <Title>Succor of Salt</Title>
            <Text>They slept, each noon, for five hands. They propped up woolen blankets on bushes for shade, and Mandri was allowed to share one of these with Moteah. He could hear her breathing, feel her warmth, and despite that, there was no pounding lust in his ears.
Unusual for Mandri.
He told Obo about it, because by now they were sharing most thoughts with each other, and Obo claimed that the Hrkan hardtack Mandri was eating was mixed with succor of salt. Succor of salt is an anaphrodisiac, it curbs the libido. He said that the Hrkan Lords don’t want their troops rubbing uglies when they’ve got more important things to do.
Mandri resolved to eat no more of the hardtack, but changed his mind when Obo forced him to consider the alternative—he’d be out here in the Sand, his lust pounding away, his uglies alert, with no real way to find release.</Text>

            <Text>Halfway through that first day’s journey, Mandri’s skin started to burn and Moteah offered him some kell oil. He dropped everything and slathered himself up with the sticky red stuff—he covered his hands, his face, the back of the neck. Obo reminded him to get the backs of his ears as well. Moteah told him to keep it away from the shallow of the eye, as kell oil stings the eyes.
Now Mandri was as red as the rest of them. He figured in a year, if he lived that long, he’d be indistinguishable from any other outland poke.</Text>

            <Title>Ayram</Title>
            <Text>Mandri sat long enough in the Ayramun’s limestone pit to get bored. He was still recovering from the rigor of death, and he stretched out his legs as the sun crossed over to noon, such that its light shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. Most of the Ayramun retreated into the tunnel. Mandri preferred the warmth and had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd of brown ragged men and women came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, chattering excitedly like children. Then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention, and there, out of the shadows, came Ayram.
Mandri had never seen a man so big in all his life.
He’d seen giants in paintings, but those were paintings. The genre of the conquering hero was something of a joke amongst artists, a tired genre, an unreality meant to lift up ordinary men in the eyes of their subjects. But Ayram was no ordinary man. The first thought that came to Mandri’s mind was, ‘Arnaggu’.
Arnaggu is the first Hrkan Lord, a true conquering hero, and in some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towers above the sandswept Forni plain. It is a terrifying piece. The relief itself sits four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicts stretches all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image is a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen, limbs splayed out like flattened lizards, with torsos bared and hips skirted like slaves, their faces are fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu’s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is ten times as large as any other. He stands at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage, and his upper torso and head are the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seems to be tearing himself out of the rock, eyes wild, teeth bared, as if he’d just heard whispers of rebellion and was rising to the challenge.
Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen. Despite that prickling sense of awe that stippled his skin, he was wholly unimpressed with it. He saw past all of its tricks, the over-reliance on scale—make something big enough and a person standing next to it is bound to feel small, and here, Arnaggu had taken a shortcut to scale by carving his image into a mountain, and so the viewer is forced to contend with not only the relief but the entirety of the rock. 
 Not even the great relief of Arnaggu could convince Mandri of the truth behind the conceit of the conquering hero. No man was born to conquer. He’d seen Hrkan Lords in the flesh, and they were ordinary men.
Ayram looked like Arnaggu himself stepping out from that rock relief, for he was a true giant, and his stern countenance seemed carved from stone. His hair was wrapped up in a black headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a round, black, bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style of beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet, who was himself named after a mountain. Ayram wasn’t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens—the man was a true giant. And the way he moved, with his too-long legs wrapped in faded black wool and swinging in a loping gait, he seemed half-built from a spider.
Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, he carried under his arm the body of a conquered wretch, none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo, whose bald head was twisted the right way around, eyes blinking in the sun. Set against Ayram’s bronzed skin, black robes, and giant frame, Obo was as pale and as unseemly as a naked rat. Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him, all staring at the Mazid like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for their master to divvy up the meal.
The awkward nakedness of Obo’s unnatural body drew hearty jeers. Tob was quick to point out that this Mazid didn’t have an asshole.
“No wonder he acts like his shit don’t stink,” he said, smirking.
“It does when it comes out the mouth,” said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.
“Bet it does!” Tob roared. He slapped his knee and then killed the joke by hitting it square in the face—“Shit comes out its mouth because its full of shit!”
His belly-rumbling laugh was followed a storm of obscenities that rained down upon poor Obo. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, beard frowning, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.
But Obo bore their insults with a casual shrug and the indifferent bearing of a bullied child who’d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo smiled as if to gloat. This triggered another roar of fury and renewed calls for the Mazid’s head on a spike. Ayram settled them all down with a shrill, sharp, two-fingered whistle. 
Then Ayram spoke. His voice was low and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous chest.
“Elrahet!” he shouted.
Mandri took the word to be some obscure Old Jandri expression. Then out of the cave came a short old woman hobbling along with a cane. She was clouded in a mass of ruffled up black tatters, and she kept her shawled head downcast in deference. With her spine as bowed as it was, her head was no taller than Ayram’s hip.
She was not alone. Stumbling along behind her was a Jandri girl wrapped in a mottled, brown blanket. She leaned against Elrahet’s stooped back, and the pair moved with deliberate care as the girl was clearly drugged, or drunk. Mandri guessed drunk because she walked with that familiar rhythmless, scuffing, shuffle of blurred instinct. She would have fallen at least twice if Elrahet was not there to steady the load. The third time, Elrahet shrugged and let the girl fall.
“Toughen up!” the old woman snipped as the girl caught herself on hand and knee.
When this girl looked up her eyes locked on the Mazid, and her chin jerked up. The sun’s light revealed to all a sickly pale face, which is no small thing for a Jandri girl reddened by kell oil and the sun. Her high and narrow cheeks were troubled by a huge mess of tousled brown hair and a clear lack of sleep, though her dark eyes were set in cold resolve as she fought back a grimace as she stood back up. Huddled up as she was under the blanket, the source of her pain was not clear.
Ayram grabbed the girl’s shoulder and pulled her up straight. He shook her gently, and he called her name to bring her to attention. 
“Purl,” he said. “Purl, look at me.”
Purl looked up at the giant with bleared amazement. 
“It’s time,” said Ayram. “I want you to command the Mazid. Command it to kneel to me.”
Ayram let go of Purl and she, unbalanced, swayed into his hip. Ayram caught her, held her steady, then pointed his long arm at Obo and said, “Go on.”
Purl poked a trembling hand out of her blanket and rubbed her swollen eyes. Then she took a deep breath, steadied herself, and when she was good and ready, she commanded the Mazid to Kneel. Her voice was soft and troubled.
“Kneel.”
Obo did not move. Instead, he said, untroubled, “Could you say that again? I didn’t quite catch your meaning.”
Purl clenched her teeth and puffed her chest. With a snarl reminiscent of the old Junkite Queens, she bellowed, “Kneel!”
Mandri thought he saw the sand shiver under Purl’s bare feet, and he squirmed as a cool air blew down from nowhere and brushed his flouncy curls and kissed his warm skin. If the girl had just spent her magic, it was a poor effort, for Obo did not kneel.
“Come now,” said Obo. “If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
His dismissiveness enraged the girl. She tossed off her blanket, and along with it went any sign of the lethargy and pain which plagued her features. She held out her left arm, and there her hand was missing—only recently severed off. The resulting nub was poulticed and bandaged tight, though without much care, as strands of wet and green leafy weeds dangled out of it. She aimed this weedy thing at the Mazid as if it were a weapon. Mandri understood, then what was happening—Purl was Obo’s new Minder, and her dainty, severed hand was stuck inside Obo’s chest, squeezing the malformed slug of muscle that passed for a heart.
“KNEEL!” she screamed, and her shout shook Mandri’s heart in its calloused cage. The word rattled the pit’s chalky walls, then rebounded into the cave behind her, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back out. That this powerful shout had come from such a frail and ailing girl was the least incredible thing, for the air between Purl and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if the girl’s very shout had somehow thwacked the sandy ground like an invisible whip.
Obo’s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether. For a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Purl’s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. 
“Almost!” said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had sapped Purl of her strength. She wobbled and collapsed to her knees.
“Oh,” he said amused, “is that what you wanted me to do?”
Mandri stifled a snicker at this brazen taunt. The old woman, Elrahet, hissed at Obo, then sneered at the defeated Purl. Ayram sighed, then he strolled over to Obo so that he towered over the creature. He asked the Mazid,“Why are you not kneeling?”
Obo stood defiant, naked and without shame. He met Ayram’s withering eye with a blank stare and said plainly, “I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
Ayram rubbed his tired brow and spared look behind the girl, who was doubled over in pain. He said to Obo, “She is your Minder, yes?”
“She is.”
“Then why can’t she command you?”
“Because her will is weak. In truth, a Minder cannot command me to do anything.”
“I’ve seen a Minder move a Mazid’s limbs.”
“No, a Minder can’t command me, but they can stop me from doing something they don’t want me to do.”
Ayram thought for a moment and said, “What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which.”
“To command is to direct, to stop is to interfere. Think of a Minder’s connection to a Mazid as a leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash as much as possible, and when that leash is short enough, there is some measure control. But your girl does not have the right kind of will for it. My leash, it seems, is quite long.”
Ayram chewed on Obo’s words. He seemed as if he did not like the taste.
“Why haven’t you split us all with Mazidfire?”
Obo said, “My leash is short enough, at least, to stop me from doing anything like that.”
Ayram muttered a frustrated curse under his breath, then said, “Someone toss me a dagger.”
A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram’s feet. Ayram picked it up. The blade seemed like a toothpick in his great hand. He stepped towards the Mazid, reached down, and put the blade’s edge up tight against the side of Obo’s neck.
“Kneel,” he said.
“Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from the girl.”
Ayram rotated the dagger so that its point was digging into Obo’s skin. He said through gritted teeth, “If I can’t get you to do what I want, then I have no use for you.”
“Then I suggest you direct your attention towards the girl.”
Ayram pushed the tip of the dagger into Obo’s flesh, more in curiosity than cruelty. He pushed the blade a few inches into the neck. Obo didn’t cringe from pain, though his whole bald body was tense, reminiscent of some sword-swallower mid-trick. When Ayram withdrew the blade, barely a trickle of blood spilled out from the wound.
The giant tossed the knife away in disgust. He stepped back and scratched his tufted chin, then massaged his frustrated brow.
Old Elrahet interrupted his fretting by saying, “If Purl can’t do it, we find someone who will.”
Ayram glared at the old woman, effectively shutting her up. Then he continued his deep rumination. It was such a show of hard thinking that Mandri began to suspect that the man wasn’t actually thinking at all, and that this was a show for his followers, to give them the impression that he still had moves to play.
Obo said aloud, “I have a potential solution.” 
“Do you?” said Ayram, feigning interest.
“You have something I want, and I have something you want.”
“A bargain, is it? A little give and take with a puppet like you?”
“Yes, a bargain.”
A few chuckles rose from amongst Ayramun. Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his.
“I don’t treat with Hrks,” Ayram said flatly.
“I am not a Hrk. I am beholden to you, and I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don’t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. If you give me a mouthful of water then I will kneel to you. I will grovel, if you like.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the unnamed Ayramun and demanded their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram caught it, opened it up and took a drink. He swished it around his mouth, bulging his beard, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he said, “I didn’t know the Mazidai needed water.”
“We don’t,” said Obo. “This is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of good faith.”
“You first, then,” Ayram said. “Give us a gesture of goodwill—to demonstrate the principle.”
Obo immediately got down on one knee. He even bent his head in supplication, and it seemed his back was bent by honest, pure obeisance.
“You’re a curious creature,” said Ayram, almost impressed. Obo raised his head in expectation, but Ayram added, “It goes against my nature to give a Hrk water, Hrkan puppet or no. I hope you understand.”
“I do.”
“However…” said Ayram, letting the word hang in the air for dramatic effect. “I will give you whatever you want if you do just one thing for me. There is a man…a creature…an abomination, I want you to kill it.”
“I would kill anyone you like, but if I can’t trust you to give me water, how can I trust you to give me my ‘heart’s greatest desire’?”
Ayram stood stunned, because it was a good point. He begrudgingly bent down and handed the waterskin over to the Obo. This action was met with much grumbling on behalf of the Ayramun, but Ayram silenced them all with a glare. Obo, for his part, did not drink from the waterskin, he simply set it down next to his knee.
“So who is it you want me to kill?” Obo asked.
“A  god-swallower. The demon of demons. A beast called the Amalgamete.”
“I’ve never heard heard of it. But sure, I’ll do it, if you give me what I want.”
“What is your price?” Ayram asked.
“Freedom.”
“I’ll let you run into whatever hole you like once you kill it.”
“I mean true freedom. I have only a pseudospark pulsing inside my stomach—it is a Minder’s will which thumps my heart. If you give me my own bright Spark, I will do whatever you wish.”
“Give you a Spark?”
“I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into that boy’s body.” Obo pointed to Mandri, and Mandri shrunk inside his loose robe as all eyes suddenly turned to him. Obo continued, “If you could infuse his corpse with a Spark which was not his own, then do the same for me.”
Ayram eyed his old witch and asked, “Can this be done?”
Elrahet was standing as still as scarecrow. The ragged layers of her black robes were draped over her leathery bones like wilted leaves on a stiff and withered desert tree. “I cleansed the boy’s Spark,” she said gruffly. “I did not breathe him a new one.”
Ayram shrugged and mused, “If it can’t be done.”
Elrahet growled, and her hand twisted tight on her sand-smoothed cane. “I did not say it could not be done,” she said. “A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require a sacrifice, too great a sacrifice. Better to wring the will out of the girl, or find another Minder.”
“I agree,” said Ayram. “We cannot trust the creature. Now, Moto and Tob, come hold it flat.”
Bushy Tob and a tall black Zozan stood up and rushed over to the kneeling Mazid. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand, throwing punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. 
“Settle down Tob,” Ayram said as he wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar. This bar was one piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head, and at one end was a splayed chisel, and at the other was a round ball the size of his own great fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled it as if it were a spear.
“If I can’t make you kneel on my own terms, then you won’t need your legs. And we can’t risk you running away again. I hope you understand.”
Obo said, “Unfortunately, I do.”
Ayram raised his spear. Mandri shut his eyes. Mandri could hide from the sight but he could not from the sound of Ayram’s chisel-head spear stabbing into Obo’s upper leg, snapping the bone. And he couldn’t help but sneak a peek as the Zosan, Moto, knelt down next to Obo’s left hip, and hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons, and they began their gruesome work again on Obo’s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.
Through it all, Obo did not squeak or speak a sound.
When it was done, and Obo was legless, Ayram said, “Someone bag the Mazid up! We’ve got a long walk ahead of us.”
All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled into their cave to grab more. Forty came over to Mandri and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked across the pit, he glanced towards Obo, whose freshly broken body was a frightful sight. And just as Mandri’s heart was strafed by the shame of even bearing witness, that damned bald Mazid looked him right in the eye, smiled, and gave him another wink.</Text>
            <Notes>NEED to rework conversation because we already kinda know that they want to kill the Amalgamete, though Obo doubts it.

Concussive

I didn’t give him a spark, I resusitated it.</Notes>

            <Text>“Quick!” Salavan shouted as he pushed himself up off the dead brat. “A pellet! Quick!”
A false wall opened up to reveal a hidden closet and a skinny slave woman, Lorba, who hustled out, bearing in her hands a small ceramic platter laden with black pellets the size and shape of finger bones. These knobby pellets squirmed like worms, and Salavan licked his lips as he pinched one and stuffed it into the dead brat’s mouth.
“Water!”
Lorba ducked back into the closet and pulled from it a bag of water. Salavan sat the boy up, and Lorba held the waterbag above the boy’s mouth while Salavan cradled the lolling head in his left arm. He clamped the flopping jaw around the waterbag’s mouthpiece while he constricted the flow into the throat with his free right hand. As the water dripped, Salavan wiggled the boy’s head forward and back, undulating the throat, trying to guide the black pellet down to the stomach where the Spark was quickly fading.
“Move away,” Salavan commanded after he flicked the dripping mouthpiece aside. Lorba shuffled back, clutching the waterbag against her stomach as she watched her master pat the boy’s back like he were burping a baby. Eventually the boy’s stomach heaved and a cupful of water came spouting out of his throat.
“White light!” Salavan shouted in triumph. He let the dead body go limp and he stood up to observe his handiwork. “If I didn’t snag this Spark, I would have hated myself forever.”
When he remembered Lorba was still in the room, he said to her, “Pick it up.”
Lorba tossed the waterbag into the closet. She then hugged the boy up against the wall, and then crouched to let him fall onto her shoulders. She’d become quite efficient at carrying half-dead bodies up and out of this basement. 
“We have no time to waste,” Salavan barked. “They’re leaving tonight!”
Salavan ran up the stairs, two at a time, and Lorba hustled up after him. She followed him through the many white rooms and corridors of his great house, and she followed him out into the gray rain, across the white stone yard, and into his wagon-house, which was more of a sheltered porch that adjoined his western wall. Underneath this shelter was the horse, Jaggy, a calm, amenable beast who was happy to listen to the rain tap-tapping against the clay shingles of his shelter’s roof.
“I’ll get the horse hitched,” said Salavan as he slipped the knot in Jaggy’s reins that tied the beast to the shelter’s post.
Lorba sauntered around them towards the wagon, which was already full with bodies of half-dead, spark-snagged bodies.
“There’s no room,” Lorba squawked.
“Damn it, woman, stuff it in!”
Lorba grumbled a curse and dropped the

            <Text>“These are outland pokes, Obo. What does every outland poke want? To a man and woman, they want Hrk destroyed. And you’re a Mazid. You possess the most destructive power known to man. They captured you because they want to use you against your masters. That’s why Ayram was so upset when his girl couldn’t control you.”

“That is strange, isn't it? I’ve been trying to figure out your role in all of this. These Ayramun aren’t in a position to accommodate a freeloader, so I don’t understand why they would haul you around, or why they brought you back from the dead in the first place.”
“Probably some old desert superstition,” Mandri said, thinking back to the old demon witch who’d started this all in the first place.</Text>

            <Text>The first object of note was a half-buried corpse of a large lizard, maybe half Mandri’s size. It was freshly dead from the storm, though it didn’t look like it, as most of its flesh had been stripped down to the bone.. What was left was being torn up by a small horde of flying beetles that looked like green jewels. Seb briefly stopped to collect as many of these beetles as he could. He offered one to Mandri, but Mandri declined. Seb said, “They’re good chewin’, but I don’t got the teeth for ‘em anymore.” He proceeded to suck out the beetle’s innards through its rump like it were an oyster.
A few feet away from this dead lizard was a living one of the same species. Moteah called it a garool, and she said they slept unstirred under the sand for years until the rains came, and they’d wake up, mate, lay eggs, feast, then return to their quiescence. A charmed life, if not for the fact that this one’s partner was dead.</Text>

            <Text>Vigram then regaled Mandri with the story of his own life, and he’d tell it in a way so as to suggest that accumulating wealth was a difficult thing that required the most severe focus and rigid discipline.
First, inherit four ounces of silver. 
Next, loan it out and collect interest.
Finally, enjoy.
Vigram included a bunch of unnecessary steps in between, and he made it all sound more noble than it was, but who cares. The only thing truly presumptuous about his telling was his conclusion, “No debasement necessary.” The man made people into slaves when they couldn’t pay.

Vigram needed this explained.
Mandri said, “The sun moves, so these shadows will move…all these leafy shadows are going to be a whole other thing to worry about. It’s easier to learn one thing at a time. It’ll be easier if we keep to simple, clean light, that way there’s no shadow shapes drifting across the face while you’re trying to figure out which eye goes where.”

. But oh, her eyes. Impossible not to flirt with those sparkling brown eyes.

            <Title>Goree Pass</Title>
            <Text>The creation and the curse of the Goree Pass is a simple story. An ancient tribe, called the Solgruin, asked Solraheen to split the Goree mountains so that their overland journey east would be made easier. Solraheen denied them, for He did not want to destroy any part of His creation just to accommodate trade. But the Solgruin asked again, and again, and on the fourth asking, Solraheen lost His patience. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there He stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
The curse he spoke was heard by every ear in all the world.
“Look upon this scar which mars My creation and hate your selfish ways. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, but so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
Mandri loved this story. It was one of his favorites. Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin, and Mandri used it as justification to rip up a painting to spite a client. 
He’d only ever done it once, but what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a month and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the barbarian King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would walk through her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a barbaric outland King on a richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, “That looks just like your Pookum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Pookum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with a righteous fury, as that unfamiliar euphoria motivated him to tear the painting completely in half, which he did, and he did it right in front of that cursed woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have killed that woman, just as Solraheen killed those who journeyed the Goree Pass. Well, Solraheen didn’t kill them exactly, He cursed them.
Curses, it turns out, can be avoided through sheer reason. Solraheen said, “Cursed are you who pass through it,” and it was argued that He meant the ‘you’ to be a restrictive ‘you’ which refers only to the Solgruin. Everyone else could pass through fine, and pass through they did. After all, here was Mandri and the Ayramun, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the Pass. And people lived in the Pass, most notably the Greskalun, led by Greskal, an old Jandri tribe whose charge was to keep the pass free from anyone who had a single drop of Solgruin blood.
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, and further out was the black rock sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib from spreading out of control. 
The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen’s spite became, for the ground under Mandri’s feet grew uneven, and rocks popped up like roots to trip him. The Goree’s walls grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground. An eon of blasting sand rounded the edges of these cracks, pillowed the seams, giving the rock the appearance of being bloated with infection. Mandri’s mood dimmed at the sight of them—it was quite apparent that the place was cursed. 
Soon the Goree Pass was sighted in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree’s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Obo informed Mandri that this splinter was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the breadth of the Pass’s mouth, protecting against ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now, and had done so for centuries.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through a debris field from a mountain cleft exploding.
The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been impossible to believe if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Solraheen standing up on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the dusty wind. A god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe to set the mountains quaking, bursting, and out would come a torrent of stones the size of houses. In the blink of an eye, a long sliver of the mountain would be reduced to rubble.
The Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram walked with a bowed head, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his giant pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, as if his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—brooding and quiet.
Mandri was marching behind Seb, who was chewing her borcandi spines so hard that her jaw was going stiff. She had to sort of rub the spines between her stubby teeth instead of chew. And the woman wasn’t paying attention to where she was spitting her juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, she hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel above her.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted herself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Don’t disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me disrespect you?”
“You threaten a woman with her kneecaps, that’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“It was an accident.”
“And I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He was so irritated with the two of them that he doubled back. “Nobody talks from here on out. Nobody except me.”
Mandri asked, “Why? Is something wrong?”
“I said nobody talks.”
Ayram’s deep voice rumbled Mandri to his core. Obo was not so affected. He added, from behind Mandri’s ear, “The Hrks will be on us today.”
Ayram’s eyes went wide. “You can sense the Hrks?”
“I can,” said Obo, “But the Hrks aren’t who you should be worried about. It’s the Greskalun. Something’s happened to them.”
Seb groaned. “Can we gag the damn thing up?”
Ayram’s grave visage lingered on Obo a moment, unsure of how much he could trust the Mazid. Then he set off again towards the Pass, this time more cautiously, more careful to crouch and hide his bulk behind boulders.
By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. This once living mountain was dead and rotted through. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock, for they were as friable as the hardtack Mandri was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased—when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against the mountain’s foot, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the mountain were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread.
Then there was the black tower that poked out of the Pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower. And no bright Spark ever builds in black, though Mandri admitted that the tower’s blackness lent it monumental significance. So it was fitting, in a way, as the central task of a monument is to look like it doesn’t belong. The tall spike sticking out of the Pass did this quite comfortably. It marked a curse which did not belong.
Mandri feared he’d die on the approach, for the brittle rock above threatened to come galloping down upon him every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks as Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by the apparently invisible Hrkan pursuit. He pioneered a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo using a Mazidariga, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered for making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof that Obo was wrong about the Hrks, and that he was wrong about ‘something happening’ to the Greskalun. 
Then the Goree pass opened up before them.
The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle of the narrow pass. Stubby black stone walls filled the short gaps on either side of it. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s gate at its base, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that Obo was right—something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off towards the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb broke the rule of silence with a whisper. “Maybe they all retreated, went back to their temple.” Seb was so stressed out that she was chewing two spines at once and her words were garbled by a slosh of spit.
“Retreated from what?” Moteah asked.
“Don’t ask me,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Mandri.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “That could be! Happened before. That’s what pokes do when the pox gets on them, they run away then stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.” 
“I don’t think we should go in,” Mandri said, though he knew his opinion didn’t matter. He received several glares for his trouble. “It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since forever.”
“It is not cursed,” said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows. But as soon as he said the words, a black vulture appeared to melt out of the tower’s pointed roof. It hissed as it took flight.
“It’s only a bird,” Ayram muttered as they all watched the bird spread its long wings and ride a thermal high up into the air, where it wheeled in circles.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and soared up to join their brother’s holding pattern. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient curse.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Ayram, “Then the Hrks would have all choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The giant tried to maintain his stoic frown, but Mandri could see that the mood was affecting even him, which was perfectly understandable, for the strongest men have the most to lose from a curse, and a curse was not something they could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion that everything was going according to plan.
Ayram marched over to Mandri, and Mandri flinched, fearing that Ayram had somehow heard his thoughts.
“Take off your pack,” Ayram grumbled.
Mandri obediently swung Obo’s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it, set it down, and he squatted next to it so he could get a clear look at Obo’s face, or maybe it was so Obo could get a clear look at his—the man looked ready to kill.
“Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?” he asked. There was no room in his tone for games.
“No,” said Obo, as if the question were a bore. “You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. I know you outland pokes abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when—”
“The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.”
Obo set his sight on the tower itself. This was the first time he’d seen it, as he’d been stuck on Mandri’s back up until now. His face betrayed nothing.
He said, “If you are asking me if there’s an army of Hrkan Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. However, I do think your instincts are correct—what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter.”
Seb spat at Obo, and the loogie just missed his shoulder and splatted harmlessly against a rock. “Them Greskalun could be here. Pox, Hrks, drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” said Moteah, doubtfully.
Obo rolled his eyes at both women, and instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter. His elbows stretched his swaddling robe as he twisted around. Mandri couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight of it—Obo looked like a toddler trying to roll over, trying to get comfortable for a nap. With effort, Obo poked his right hand up out of the neck of his tightly wrapped robe, and he used it to widen the opening so that he could stick his whole pale arm through. Once done, he reached out behind him and grabbed a bone that was half buried in the dirt.
“Interesting bone, isn’t it?” he said. “I’m surprised it escaped your notice.”
Obo set the bone out before him, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.
“This is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.”
Seb stomped over and nudged it with her toe. “You find one bone and you think them dead? One bone in the ground? A bone in the ground ain’t unusual. Where else you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Let the Mazid speak,” said Ayram.
Obo nudged the bone so that it flipped over.
“This is an unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
He stroked the length of the bone’s fracture with a thin, white finger. It was a jagged fracture which stretched almost along the whole length of the bone, leaving the upturned half looking like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unfazed.
“Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that would be expected, because that’s how bones naturally break. A break like this—it’s not likely to happen accidentally.”
Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “So you say this person was killed? That’s not unusual.”
Mandri blurted out, “I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the Pass.”
“We’re not in the Pass.”
Obo said, “Whoever it was, however they died, that is not significant. What is significant, is that a blow to the leg would not crack the bone lengthwise like that. It could happen, but the chances of it occurring are exceedingly slim.”
“Get on with it,” Ayram grumbled.
“I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri ruin. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating each other. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone up so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside. Lizards can’t do this. Neither can dogs. They don’t have the hands for it.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with images of some grungy, sand-crusted cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his filed teeth.
Ayram held the bone out away from him as if it were diseased.
Elrahet waddled over and yanked the bone from his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the open socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone into Obo’s stumpy lap, and as it fell, Moteah shouted, “Look!”
She was pointing towards the tower’s gate, out of which Moto was sprinting. He sprinted at full speed, frenetic, as if being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust down there in the mouth of the Pass.
When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!” He looked over his shoulder and grimaced.
“Pick up the Mazid,” Ayram said to Mandri, and with that it was decided—Ayram would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower and its gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled, and bulging ever so slightly outward. Most of its bricks were chipped, some were twisted, some seemed to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The gate underneath was just as ominous, it was ten-men wide and its arch was fanged by metal teeth which would have scratched Ayram’s head if he did not duck. The gate tunnel was as long as the hall of a Hrkan Lord, cavernous enough to turn the thump of Ayram’s walking spear into an echoing beat. Aside from this steady meter, they passed through the dark in silence, casting wary glances at the empty door frames that pocketed either side.
Moto, who’d taken the lead, stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and the shadow of shadows passed over his face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it, and all around, stuck into the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were large wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
It was a desecration.
Such was the defilement that panic leapt into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. But he was rooted to the spot, for the horror robbed him of every faculty, and it set his stomach roiling in a terrible, growling fit.
The nearest wretch was only ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant pilgrim. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, lolled in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of Sol.
They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His broken scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor pilgrims littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.
Obo, with the use of his newly freed arm, hauled himself up onto Mandri’s shoulder to see for himself.
Mandri muttered, “What is this?” and for once, Obo had no answer.
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Seb, a woman who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil scene halfway through the tunnel, for she had not made it out into the courtyard. She was standing inside in the tunnel’s shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep as if her belly ached.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye towards his mournful band. He said, “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, even Hrkan pilgrims, but I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into her skin, and she said in turn, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? Sides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em ‘cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’.”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as she gestured at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them. “Moteah’s right.”
The stern assertion stunned them all back into silence, and Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the tunnel after the witch.
Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up as straight as her back allowed.
“Must have been the panic,” she said as she walked towards the courtyard. It seemed all her joints were aching, like every weary moment of the long journey was suddenly set upon her.
“Mere hate, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets a stomach growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light and surveyed the courtyard with a spiteful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? You have sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I don’t know what you—”
“PANIC!” Elrahet shrieked. “Panic sets its stomach growling. Panic wakes it up.”
“Wakes what up?” Mandri asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled.
“The Amalgamete.”
The graveled word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a rock aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“Was the Amalgamete that did this,” the witch declared. “A man who became the Amalgamete.”
Ayram, still composed, said, “We’ll do what we can for them, then we leave.”
“Nothing we can do can help these grim pilgrims.”
Seb spat her agreement onto the courtyard brick and said flatly, “Dead is dead.”
“They are not dead,” said Elrahet, sneering.
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim. He’d seen enough of death to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive.
On second glance the pilgrim’s wounds were quite peculiar. The strip of missing skin on the outside of his thigh was circumscribed by white-pink rings of fresh skin.
Fresh skin…
Still growing…
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered. Mandri sprang back just as the man’s ruined head jerked up, tossing a spill of blood at Mandri’s feet. The pilgrim’s tongue twisted out of his yawning mouth as he tried in vain to grasp a wet breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs. He wheezed and gulped, and his chest heaved against the rope of thorns, but in the end his eyes rolled back and his whole body went limp and quiet.
“His very Spark is bound to the pole,” Elrahet explained. She seemed unable to look upon the pilgrim. “He will die, and die, and die again.” Her bottom lip quivered, and she seemed about to explode in rage, then she then stamped her cane into the ground and proclaimed, “This is not safe! We must leave at once!”
She hobbled back into the tunnel.
Moto was the first to follow. Then Ayram and Moteah. Mandri joined them in the shadow of the tower and was glad to be gone from that courtyard.
Seb remained.
“Hold on,” she said, indignant. “We’re goin’ back!? What about the Greskalun?” She jabbed an open hand towards the dark rent in the mountains behind, as if the Greskalun were right there and the others only had to squint a little to see them.
“There are no Greskalun,” Moteah said again.
But Seb stood her ground. “You can’t know that ‘til we go and have a look! We at least got to look!”
“That Pass is cursed!” Moto exclaimed, but Seb merely crossed her arms and argued, “Can’t be worse than Hrks.” 
Then, from the desert, there came a sharp and roaring bleat—the Hrkan horn of war.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommm

The call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and all eyes raced westward, for there in the distance was a speck of man set against the glare of the desert. All that could be made of him were the familiar blue robes of a Hrkan scribe. At his side was a shorter figure wrapped in black, a Mazidariga, and behind them, from around the sprawling tumble of the Goree’s shattered stones, was a double-column of white robed soldiers marching in even squares.
“RUN!” Ayram roared, and if that wasn’t enough to prod Mandri into motion, the Mazidariga’s warbling whistle split the air, sending Obo into convulsions inside his litter. 
Mandri turned and ran through the accursed courtyard, weaving a route around the pilgrim poles and up the courtyard slope. There the whistle pitched into a mind splitting squeal. Mandri dropped to his knees. He cowered against the sound, and he prayed a broken prayer between gasps as Obo’s psuedospark was stolen.
When the whistling stopped, Mandri shrugged himself out of the litter’s straps and turned around to discover that Obo had gone limp.
Moteah ran right by him.
So did Moto.
Mandri shouted, “They got Obo!” 
Seb as she passed by and she shouted back, “Get runnin’ or you’re next!”
Mandri picked the litter back up and ran. Ayram came galloping by with Elrahet clinging to his pack like a spider. 
“Hurry!” she screeched. She climbed over Ayram’s pack to ride his shoulders as he overtook the file and led the flight into the dark heart of the Goree Pass.</Text>
            <Notes>OBO NEVER SAYS HE BELIEVES

Need to knock Obo unconscious here.


The more you listen to someone, the more they use the word ‘they’ the more likely their full of shit.

It was a metallic, tinny tone that quivered like a strandtail’s warble, only it was ten times louder and harsher than any shriek any bird could ever make. That damned sound cut through the rock so clearly that its source might as well have been in the room. For Mandri, it was an ear-splitting pain, but to Obo it was doing something stranger.</Notes>

            <Title>Binks</Title>
            <Text>Moteah offered Mandri a snack of binks. A bink was a yellow nut the size of a tooth, with black spots on either end. They were quite bitter. Mandri preferred the bland Hrkan hardtack.
Moteah said that binks were better for him than hardtack because they had healing properties. She said that there were mice living in the Sand that, if he could believe it, subsisted entirely on binks—no water. The binks get them through the severest droughts. She once had a pet mouse and was careful to never let it drink, as a sort of experiment. It lived on a diet of binks until the mousey old age of two.
Mandri doubted the story, but he did not say so out loud. He knew disagreement chases people away, and while that never would have stopped him in the past, he wanted Moteah to keep talking.
There was no amorous interest here. The desert was simply too big for him to get through it without hearing someone else talk. Obo was fun, but too much of one person was unhealthy.</Text>

            <Text>The target of the first leg of their journey was a clump of hills set in the distant east. Those hills, Moteah remarked, those bluish lumps hiding in the morning haze, were called the Dune Hills. Mandri asked why they weren’t simply called dunes, and Moteah said because they weren’t dunes. She added that at a pilgrim’s pace it’d be a whole day’s journey from their current position. The Ayramun did not march at a pilgrim’s pace.
Seb charged ahead in front of them all with the grim determination of a man who wanted it all over with as soon as possible. He never talked, and he never looked up from the spot of ground a few feet in front of him. He simply marched. When everyone else took a pause to water, he did not stop. Soon he was a few miles ahead, a brown poke sticking out of a sea of heat and sand. He never once looked back, and nobody called out after him to wait.
Far behind him was Ayram, and giant as Ayram was his pack seemed too big for even him. Mandri could only see him from the calves down. And there was Ayram’s right arm, which metered out the miles with his iron spear casually thupping the ground.
Close behind Ayram, lagging like an eager pup, was Moto. Moto had come out of Minting Rock as if he were never there, for he’d taken pause to beat the dust off his bright orange robe. He’d even treated Mandri’s blood stain on the shoulder with a watery brown ointment that he kept in a blue corked bottle. His pack was much smaller. Mandri could see his head.
A few yards off Moto’s heels was Mandri. He took two steps for every one of Ayram’s, and every one of these steps was a struggle. It wasn’t so much the wound in his thigh as it was the soreness. His legs hadn’t recovered from being dead and from having spent the whole night walking. He tried to distract himself by stealing words from Ayram and Moto’s conversation. Moto had his own ideas about how to capture another Mazidariga, and when Moto had an idea, he’d engage his hands and shoulders to help express it. Ayram would grunt acknowledgment, and if Moto ever said something too ridiculous the words seemed to run an itch up Ayram’s spine and the man would have to readjust his pack, sending the web of rope holding it all together creakling under the strain.
Moteah, Purl, and Elrahet formed the rear. The younger women were making sure that Elrahet didn’t fall behind, though to Mandri’s eyes Elrahet didn’t look like she needed their help. She had set off from Minting Rock at a steady pace and had never wavered. 
“She has desert legs”, is what Moto said when Mandri asked about it. Mandri didn’t know what ‘desert legs’ meant until that afternoon, after they’d crossed a good chunk of the distance and the red sand gave way to a softer, deeper pink sand. His foot would sink with every step, and that set his calves to burning. He wanted to stop walking, sit down, and massage the muscles, but how could he when Elrahet would pass him by? Every time he glanced behind, Elrahet was there, a waddling blotch of black rags propped up by her cane, threatening to make him look a weakling.
But he was a weakling. He knew it, everyone else knew it, so he didn’t know why he was soldiering through it. And it’d be at least eight more days of this—eight more days of Obo’s weight screwing a knot into his lower back. And because Mandri’s shoulders were nothing but a gormless strip of muscle lounging atop his shoulder blades and collarbone, the litter’s thin straps bit right down through them to bruise the actual bones. Mandri kept trying to shift the straps around, to try and distribute the pain, but after a while, every spot along his shoulders were tender.
The only grace given to him was the sight of the rising sun. The pink sand all around him brightened the blush of dawn such that he felt that he was swimming in it. It was a scene worth painting. He knew it wasn’t possible to capture it, but he couldn’t stop himself from thinking about it.
“God, this hurts,” he moaned. By now he’d used up every joint in his fingers to take the weight of the straps, and every fingernail was throbbing.
“You’ll find your legs in a couple of days,” Moto said over the annoying rattle of his pack. “We’re almost to the hills.”
The Sand Hills loomed large a few hundred yards away. Mandri was worried Ayram wouldn’t stop when they got there, for the heat hadn’t yet become unreasonable, and he supposed Ayram would want to squeeze effort out of every finger. Seb had already crested one hill and disappeared behind it—if they were meant to stop, surely he’d wait at the peak.
It turned out that the Dune Hills were aptly named—half clay and rock, and half sand. They weren’t sandy enough to be considered full-fledged dunes, but there was too much sand whipping about to not consider them such. They were steep, the tallest ones were a good four times Ayram’s height, and their slopes were pocked by smooth black boulders that looked like they were bleeding rust. There wasn’t a single sign of life anywhere, plant or animal.
Thankfully, there were plenty of gaps and valleys which Ayram seemed to know. To Mandri it was a confusing web in which every slip face looked exactly like every other, and all of it looked ready to collapse down on him if the earth were to give the slightest shiver. Ayram, confident as ever, led them through this maze until they came upon a shallow, sandy pan, in the center of which was the smallest temple in the world.
It was the quaintest thing, a single circular room with sand-blasted walls of rough-hewn sandstone bricks. It had a domed roof of baked clay, and set atop its center was a vertical pole of petrified wood, tipped by a coronal splay of twigs—an Old Jandri piece which signifies a sacred place.
There wouldn’t be enough room inside for all of them to shelter from the creeping sun. If they tried it would be standing room only, and Ayram’s scalp would scrape against the ceiling. Still, it was their destination, and as they approached, a swarthy man popped out of the building’s shadow, bearing a self-satisfied grin. It was Seb.
“Took you long enough,” he said.
Ayram dumped his large pack next to the little temple’s entrance, and everyone else did the same, though Mandri was a little gentler with his own. With his shoulders and back relieved of their burden, he peered into the temple’s dark interior and hoped he’d find a chair.
“We should keep going,” Moto said.
No one agreed. Elrahet waddled straight into the temple, and Purl followed.
“We’re on a good pace,” Ayram said.
“But we’re only a day out from Minting Rock.”
“And I’m four days out from solid sleep,” Ayram said. He then picked up his monstrous bag, wrangled it through the temple’s threshold, and ducked in behind it.
With Elrahet, Purl, Ayram, and Ayram’s bag stuffed inside, there’d hardly be enough room for one more, so Mandri, being considerate, offered the position to himself. He rushed towards the entrance, stuck his head inside, and was surprised to find it empty save for a hole in the middle of a black-brick floor. It was a perfectly circular hole. Below it, a firelight flickered out of sight. Ayram and the others were setting up a camp inside.
Seb pushed on Mandri’s back and said, “Hurry it up.”
“What is this place?” 
“It’s a hole in the ground. Now move it.”
The ground below the hole didn’t look too far away, maybe as far as Mandri was tall, so he jumped down into it.
His ankles were the first things to realize that the ground was much further away than he imagined. He hit the dirt hard and his tired legs crumpled against the impact. He fell forward, and the rest of him thumped against the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Seb’s voice came from raining down from up above, “You know there’s a ladder, right?”
Mandri rolled over and saw a firm wooden ladder standing there, taunting him. He was too tired to feel any kind of embarrassment, though that didn’t stop Seb from cackling as he descended down to Mandri’s level. Seb’s boots hit the floor, then he stood over Mandri and said, “I know exactly what you need.”
“I need rest,” Mandri grumbled.
“Yes, yes—that too.”
The room was a near-natural cave in the shape of an egg, with only a little bit of work elbowed into the floor to flatten and smooth it out. The wall behind the ladder opened up into a tunnel which ran farther out than Purl’s stick-and-tinder campfire flame could reach. Mandri didn’t care to ask where that tunnel led, all that mattered was that he was tired and there was enough room here to lay down. Ayram had already spread himself out, laying against his pack, arms folded, eyes closed, trying to will himself asleep.
Mandri maneuvered himself nearer the dark tunnel, for there the air was cooler. He sat down, gingerly, and claimed a spot of floor for himself. By the time Moto and Moteah wandered down the ladder, he was dreaming of burgeons and beer.
The first thing to wake Mandri up was Obo. Someone had brought Obo down the ladder and placed him next to Mandri. When Obo saw Mandri looking, he whispered, “Only two-hundred thousand steps to go.”
“What?” 
“There’s two-hundred thousand more steps until Bullr, roughly speaking.”
“Oh,” Mandri said as he closed his eyes again. Then he wondered aloud, “How many have we done already?”
“About twenty-thousand.”
“How do you know?” Mandri asked, already half asleep.
“There wasn’t much else to do but count.”
The second thing to awaken him was a feverish sweat. It was dark, for the meager fire had burned itself down to a tumble of coals, and almost none of the daylight outside made it into the hole in the ceiling. All was dark and cold, and yet, Mandri was burning up, drenched in sweat.
He sat up and fanned his robe against his tingling skin, and didn’t lay down again until he made peace with the fact that he wasn’t going to feel better. His legs ached, his back was sore, his shoulders were shredded, and he didn’t know how bad his feet had had it until he unwrapped his shoes to find that his heels were working up blisters. From then on, what sleep he managed to get came in fits and spurts, a few minutes here and there, and then he’d wake up sweating again. This back and forth sent his mind into a state of delirium, such that when Seb whispered out his name he was unsure if it were a dream.
“Mandri? You awake?”
 Mandri opened his eyes and all he saw was a shadow hovering over him. He knew it was Seb from the smell.
“Everything hurts,” Mandri groaned.
Seb leaned nearer still until he was whispering above Mandri’s ear.
“I know what you need. What you need is burgeons.”
Mandri’s ears perked up.
“You have burgeons?”
“Shhhhh,” Seb hushed. “Not so loud.”
The next thing Mandri knew he was following Seb’s faint footfalls into the darkness of the tunnel.
Mandri supposed they’d bumble around a bend or two so they wouldn’t have to whisper as they bit into the burgeons, but Seb kept going, and going, and every now and then they had to stumble down a flight of steps—never up, always down.
“Where are we going?” Mandri asked. His voice sounded strangely close to himself in the darkness, as if he were speaking directly into his own ear.
“I’ve already set up a fire, right up ahead.”
Mandri followed Seb around one more turn, then down a hall, and they stepped into a fire-lit room.
This room was a dome of natural stone with thin spikes of rock dripping down from the ceiling. On the opposite wall, there was what looked like an entrance to a cave. In the middle of the floor was a fire, and next to it, there was a chair.
A cushioned chair.
Mandri couldn’t believe his eyes. A thin, square, blackwood framed chair with a seat of suspended red cloth and a back to match with a red pillow sitting atop the seat.
Seb was walking towards it. Soon he had his hand on the skinny armrest. Such a man did not deserve to sit in such a chair.
Mandri said, “Could I sit in that chair?”
Seb sat down in it proudly and said, “My burgeons, my chair.”
There was nothing else to sit on. The room was empty and chalky white except for soot staining the ceiling. Mandri sat cross-legged on the floor next to Seb and he huddled closer to the fire. It was much colder down here than up above.
“Already sore?” Seb asked.
“I’m past sore. I’m broken.”
“Remind me to give you some spines tomorrow. I’ve got plenty.”
“They help with soreness?”
Seb leaned back in his chair and fished a green thorn out his robe’s pocket.
“You chew ‘em, an it keeps you alert. But it’s more than that. The juices work the bitch right out of you.”
Seb popped the borcandi spine into his mouth and got to chewing. The first few chomps were accompanied by a horrible crunchy squelch, like he was biting down on a beetle.
“You don’t have the jaw for ‘em,” Seb said. “Look at that jaw. You got a woman’s jaw.”
“Well, my diet consists mostly of burgeons.”
“I bet if I made a flute outta your bones it’d sound like a hollerin’ bitch.”
Mandri sat still. He’d bear any insult if there was a burgeon at the end of it.
Seb reached back into his robe. He fished around for a moment more and pulled out a leather pouch. He dangled this pouch around in the firelight, and Mandri tried not to look too impressed. 
“So, you a burgeon man?” Seb asked.
“Burgeons are the only thing that make life worthwhile.”
“Then you’re in luck. Look at what I got here.”
Seb reached into the pouch with two dirty fingers to pinched the stem of a burgeon. What he pulled out was the most beautiful burgeon that Mandri had ever seen.
“What is that?”
“We call it God’s Eye.”
Mandri marveled at it.
The most beautiful of all possible burgeons.
What a burgeon is, in short, is an intermediate stage between a flower and a fruit. Only burgeon bushes go through it. The final fruit looks something like a melted cluster of berries, with seeds dotting every pit. The burgeon itself is a plump capsule of hardened leaves, not too dissimilar to the more familiar flower bud.
The best way to grow burgeons is to shield them from the rain and drip-feed them on a careful schedule via irrigation ditch. This stresses the plant, and for some reason, the stress causes it to put out more flowers. Mandri always believed that this was a spiritually significant fact, a clear and direct example of how suffering leads one to bear richer fruit. It was one of creation’s themes to be studied right next to the notion that Solraheen creates things which create themselves. Of course, the plant can’t deal with too much suffering. Withhold all the water and the burgeons never come out at all. The suffering has to be planned out far in advance, measured and applied by an experienced torturer. A daily regimen of sufferings, precisely applied, and as Solraheen makes holy men so too can man create plump and juicy burgeons. These Gods Eye burgeons were so plump and so juicy that they must be akin to saints.
“Where’d you find those?” Mandri asked.
Seb let the burgeon roll around in his palm to let the light play on its iridescent exterior. “Beautiful, ain’t it?”
Mandri reached out to touch it but Seb quickly clutched it away. “You think I’d give it for free?”
“I don’t have anything to give you,” Mandri said. “I’m not going to suckle your toes or anything.”
“You got a dirty mind.”
“I was joking.”
Seb leaned forward in his chair to wag his finger right at Mandri’s nose.
“I know what they get up to in the cities,” he said. “It’s one sin after the next. One ill Spark corrupts all the others. That’s why people got to keep separate.”
Seb relaxed back into the chair and continued to admire the burgeon.
“What are we doing down here?” Mandri asked. “Why couldn’t we just eat the burgeons back up there?”
“Ayram don’t much appreciate burgeons. Liable to slit our throats if he gets a whiff.”
“Really?” Mandri said, eyes going wide.
“He wouldn’t actually slit our throats,” he said. “He’d be disappointed, is all.”
“I don’t want to be on Ayram’s bad side.”
“Ayram’s only got the one side. Ayram is Ayram. Nothing else.”
Mandri nodded like he understood, and to this, Seb gave a satisfied smile, like he’d just communicate some sage wisdom.
“Now,” he said, “How do you like your burgeons?”
“Any way I can get them.”
Seb scoffed, and licked his lips like he was about to say something mean, but he stopped himself.
“You’re like that Mazid,” he said. “Never can answer a question straight. Bet you would try to outwit a fart.”
“Seb, I honestly don't care—whatever you want to do to that burgeon, I will consume it. Crushed, boiled, stewed, crumbled in eggs, dripped over bacon, pressed into beer…”
“If you had to choose.”
“Well, one time I made a burgeon tea and boofed it.”
“Boofed it?”
“Poured it into my ass.”
Seb’s face screwed up as he confronted the mental image. Mandri hadn’t ever actually done this, but he loved the way the thought of it tortured Seb.
Mandri said, “That’s what I thought too until I tried it. You only need, like, a quarter of the usual amount to get the same effect if you boof it.”
“City folk,” Seb muttered, disapprovingly.
“Solraheen didn’t put a second mouth inside my butt for no reason. You ever think of it like that? I mean, if I were designing human beings, I wouldn’t mix the piping up like that, but it is what it is. It’s like you say, if He didn’t want it to happen, it wouldn’t have happened.”
Seb’s frown grew ever-deeper. He couldn’t say anything because the logic was structurally sound—it was what it was because of how it was.
Mandri said, “Think about it like this, we’re still nine days out from Bullr, and how long are those burgeons going to last us?”
“Us?” Seb asked accusingly.
“Well, okay, fine, how long will they last you?”
“This is God’s Eye, boy. It don’t take much to split open a stomach. Half a sliver off the stem would do it—even if you been accustomed.”
Seb pulled his long dagger from his waistband.
“Hold out your hand,” he said.
“Why?”
“Hold it out.”
Sane people don’t give their hands to a grungy man in a cave while that man is holding a blade. Mandri, lured by the promise of a God’s Eye burgeon, had no choice. He held out his hand.
Seb dropped that saintly burgeon into Mandri’s hand. It rolled around in his palm, and then settled onto his fingers. Seb then reached down and held the burgeon steady. His blade cut through as if it weren’t even there. Then Seb pulled away, pulled the burgeon away, and all that was left in Mandri’s hand was a few dewy drops of a cloudy pale-green sap.
“That’s it?” Mandri asked.
Seb held his blade out. Stuck to its edge was a thin sliver of burgeon. Mandri peeled it off, and then popped it in his mouth and swallowed it.
“The sap, too,” said Seb.
Mandri didn’t need encouragement to lick his fingers dry.
Then Seb whipped out a little glass vial, plopped the bleeding burgeon into it, and tucked it away.
“You aren’t having any?” Mandri asked.
“Sometimes, folks get a bad reaction to God’s Eye. It’s best if I play Minder for a while.”
“I’ll be fine.”
“Don’t be sure.”
“I bet I’ve consumed more burgeons than any man alive.”
“Just sit back and watch the fire. We’ll know soon enough how you take to it.”
Mandri stared at the fire and waited for the burgeonsight to kick in. He was quite giddy, because God’s Eye burgeons should give him a god’s sight.
“How long is this going to take?” he asked.
“Depends on the person.”
“You know I wonder if the Mazidai are affected by burgeons.”
“They ain’t got Sparks.”
“I kinda want to give some to Obo and see what happens.”
“I won’t waste a good God’s Eye on no evil creature like a Mazid.”
“Evil?”
“Yes. Evil.”
“Doesn’t seem so evil to me.”
“Hah!”
“What?”
Seb gazed into the fire and said, “I seen a Mazid roast a child on a spit.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“I saw it with my own damn eyes. It ran an iron shaft the width of my arm right through the little boy’s throat and… and then two smaller ones to pin the arms and legs.”
Seb's cheeks went flush as talked. If his story weren’t true, he’d at least convinced himself that it was.
“Why would a Mazid do that?” Mandri asked.
“Who can say why evil does what it does?”
Mandri paused for a moment and pretended to think. He wanted to think of a good explanation for what Seb had seen, but the burgeon juice was starting to work its magic. The flames of the fire were starting to slow right down.
So he simply said, “Whatever.”
“Now hold on,” said Seb. “You do understand the Mazidai are evil, don’t you?”
“Yeah, sure, they’re evil.”
“Nah, nah, nah. You think that freak upstairs is good, don’t you!?”
Mandri’s lids were getting heavy. He said, speech blurred, “You say you’ve seen some things, I’ve seen other things, I mean I can only really go on what I’ve seen.”
“That Mazid would burn the world if he got the chance.”
Mandri shrugged his shoulders.
“Don’t shrug your shoulders at me.”
“Oh, come on,” Mandri said. “You know what they say…”
“What do they say?”
“There’s always…” his thoughts fluttered as the fire’s flames turned from orange to green. “There’s always two sides to every story.”
“Two sides? You shittin’ me? TWO sides!? What’s the other side to ten thousand folk gettin’ killed for runnin’ away? Cut ‘em right the fuck in half!”
“Ohhh, shit,” Mandri murmured as the world turned around him. He lay back on the ground to try and anchor himself. This had no effect.
“There’s a stright-down evil staring you in the face, and you can’t see it ‘cause of shome jrupin ol rashsifsh agrash suj…”
Mandri could no longer make sense of Seb’s words. The rock walls were folding around him, stretching past him, and when he looked up at the soot-stained ceiling he began to fall upwards into it, imperceptibly at first, but soon enough the rock zipped past in herks and jerks, then the black stained features of the ceiling began to congeal into a ceilingless abyss. 
This was nothing like burgeon-sight. This was nothing like reality at all. In a blink he’d been transformed into what seemed like pure movement—yes, he was nothing but movement, bursting, jolting up and down, no elegant smoothing in and out, no sense of natural timing that one normally associates with Sol’s creation. It was like he was being picked up by a god who liked to play with his food.
Mandri was still all there at this point. He knew, upon further consideration, that he was not ‘movement’, that this was all the work of the God’s Eye burgeon, and almost as soon as he set his mind to the task of bringing himself down he succeeded—he was back in the cavern room, laying on the floor, staring up at that soot-stained ceiling.
But that soot was dark, black as night. Black as Fabled Black. Suddenly he was lost again, lost to the burgeon. He stared, stupefied by the sight of a fibrous purple ooze seeping out of that ceiling black, swirling like ink. As it descended it’s color changed into a deep and suffocating red. It reached down and latched onto Mandri’s stomach, adhering to his skin, for he was now, suddenly, naked.
“Seb!?” Mandri called out, but there was no reply. He looked but there was only an empty chair. He tried to scream but the fibrous red had slithered up his chest and darted into his mouth. Next thing he knew, he was cocooned, and the red color filled his sight like a fog until all edges merged into each other and Mandri could not discern where he ended and the world outside began. He tried to hold focus, he tried to count and breathe, but his inability to do it only magnified the sensation of his mind’s disassembly. 
Beyond this point, Mandri could not construct a coherent sequence of events. There were shapes. Patterns. Eyes. Stasis and metastasis merged into an impossible third state of being. Reality collapsed. And so Mandri lay there like a newborn, wide-eyed, a sense-organ with no memory, aware only of his own presence.</Text>

For people not into cooking, a roux is a 1:1 by mass mixture of flour and fat that’s cooked (to reduce the flour-y flavor) and used as a thickener. You do have to be careful about how you integrate it with liquids, just dumping everything together will cause it to not incorporate and you’ll end up with lumpy or gritty texture. It's a VERY VERY VERY common cooking tool, in both French and other cuisines. Three of the five &quot;mother sauces&quot; (sauces from which all other sauces in french cuisine are traditionally derived) use roux as a key ingredient. Dismissing everybody that uses roux is like... I dunno, being a visual artist and claiming that everybody who uses paint is an idiot.
The original post’s OP’s Mac and cheese sauce has “broken” meaning that the oils and solids have separated (because it was too hot and the casein in the cheese broke down), giving it a clumpy texture. AFAIK you can’t truly fix this once the sauce is broken, but you could disguise it.
The other poster is advocating for a more complicated niche chemical emulsifier, sodium citrate. This actually isn’t an insane idea, sodium citrate is what’s used to keep American-style processed cheeses smooth and is stable over a wide range of temperatures. Butttt it’s not a terribly helpful suggestion here as most people don’t keep it in their pantry and the poster is kinda being an ass about it.

Disparity can also just mean that food is abundant, because it takes a lot of food to fuel the adolescent male growth spurt. If food is a limiting factor at that age, adult men and women will be similar heights as adults.
The article doesn’t discuss the abundance explanation but counters it anyway by emphasizing that the height dimorphism among northerners happened together with nutritional stress during development.
But.
It doesn’t discuss whether male and female skeletons displayed equal rates of nutritional stress.
It doesn’t discuss the ages at which nutritional stress was experienced (toddlerhood vs adolescence).
It doesn’t discuss the possibility of seasonal nutritional stress due to food shortages in the spring, but recovery with abundant food the rest of the year.
So, interesting but I’d need to know more.

Thiel is the end-state of most casual libertarians, who use the label because they like to shop around for ideological justification for their preconceived biases. They tend to settle on some flavor of the Rothbardian ancap spectrum because it's developed enough they don't have to do any real thinking, and they like its distribution of political power according to the current static wealth hierarchy. Of course, these people rarely have to confront where their biases interfere with actual libertarian principles.
Thiel has achieved what can only be described as the final form, what-I-feel-validates-my-biases-ism, by discarding any associative label and embracing full ideological inconsistency in order to never admit that he's been meaningfully wrong.

In general, the premise that there are any sciences which are truly &quot;pure&quot; and which may be inherently trusted is kind of the bad beginning of a lot of the anti-econ claptrap online. I work in another scientific field, and if you go deep into the academic lit, you will find human errors, hubris, earnest oversights, and all the stupid squishy human factors that are inevitable when humans are doing your science for you. This will be true for all fields, but I think some folks like to imagine that &quot;science&quot; is some sort of purified, always-correct thing which defies those limits, and for some reason, econ in particular sticks in those folks' craws.

hidebound reactionary 

I think the &quot;minor post-Ricardian&quot; line on Marx rings most true to my ear. Marx had a (or, probably, several across his life, given the difficulties reconciling his work) concept of a what we might now call a general equilibrium model that was rooted in a value theory. He made some attempt to explain tendencies in prices, and to attempt to explain the (at the time assumed to be inherently real) tendency of the rate of profit to fall. Obviously, we've stopped attempting to solve the diamonds-and-water paradox by saying &quot;one has more X involved in it, thus it is more valuable&quot;, so this was a largely defunct line of intellectual inquiry.
Overall, his work doesn't really influence modern econ, but people who were influenced by Marx were behind some interesting models and advancements, and modern concepts of monopsonistic labour markets definitely have some of their origins in those people. Does old Karl deserve credit for that? Well, I suppose as much as some of the old Austrian Marginalists. Which is to say &quot;in my opinion, only to a small extent&quot;, but some might disagree.

Dalio asks his minions for honest feedback, including on his own performance. He does not often get it, of course. Paul McDowell, tasked with designing the “Principles Operating System,” Copeland writes, “assigned an underling to go into the software and program a new rule. Dalio himself would be the new baseline for believability in virtually all important categories. As the original, topmost believable person at Bridgewater, Dalio’s rating was now numerically bulletproof to negative feedback. Regardless of how everyone else in the firm rated him, the system would work to keep him on top.” 

There is one point in the book in which Dalio is publicly questioned by an employee at a Bridgewater town hall, and reverts to the wealthy guy’s ultimate retort: “If you’re so smart, why aren’t you rich?”

My reading recommendations on the origin of life for people without college chemistry, are;
Hazen, RM 2005 &quot;Gen-e-sis&quot; Washington DC: Joseph Henry Press
Deamer, David W. 2011 “First Life: Discovering the Connections between Stars, Cells, and How Life Began” University of California Press.
They are a bit dated, but are readable for people without much background study.
If you have had a good background, First year college; Introduction to Chemistry, Second year; Organic Chemistry and at least one biochem or genetics course see;
Deamer, David W. 2019 &quot;Assembling Life: How can life begin on Earth and other habitable planets?&quot; Oxford University Press.
Hazen, RM 2019 &quot;Symphony in C: Carbon and the Evolution of (Almost) Everything&quot; Norton and Co.
Note: Bob Hazen thinks his 2019 book can be read by non-scientists. I doubt it.

Nick Lane spent some pages on the differences between Archaea and Bacteria cell boundary chemistry, and mitochondria chemistry. That could hint at a single RNA/DNA life that diverged very early, and then hybridized. Very interesting idea!

Heidegger rejected the &quot;biologically grounded racism&quot; of the Nazis, replacing it with linguistic-historical heritage.[122]by living according to the principle of race [the Jews] had themselves promoted the very reasoning by which they were now being attacked and so they had no right to complain when it was being used against them by the Germans promoting their own racial purity.”

On 3 October, Dafydd was drawn through the streets of Shrewsbury to his place of execution, attached to a horse's tail. There he was hanged until losing consciousness, then revived, disembowelled, eviscerated, and made to watch as his entrails burned before him for &quot;sacrilege in committing his crimes in the week of Christ's passion&quot; (Easter) 
This was an area where, as at wadi kubbaniya, foragers relied heavily on seasonally flooded embayents, places where catfish and tilapia  gathered and dense mats of purple nut grass grew.

Jarawa were ambushed so often that, though they usually went around naked, they took to wearing bark armor to ward off arrows.
Ambushes of this kind are too small-scale to be considered war, but they can be nasty, and once begun they can turn into blood feuds that can last for years. While blood feuds tend to arise with clans, there are exceptions to this rule of thumb. In areas of rich resources like those of the tropical Andaman Islands, described later, even clanless foragers could “afford to make enemies of their neighbors,” as Kelly puts it. In the case of Jebel Sahaba, however, we believe that we are dealing with societies with clans. One reason is that the site was a cemetery.


Aborigines did not believe there was such a thing as inevitable natural death. Death resulted either from homicide or witchcraft.

While many tribes had enemies for neighbors, there was one person who could travel widely without fear of death: the sacred messenger. The messenger might, for example, be carrying the red-painted forearm bone of a deceased relative,. Owing to his sacred mission, the meessenger could not be harmed.

Because the Aka-Bea and Jarawa spoke different dialects, it was difficult for them to hold peacemaking ceremonies. In areas where there was no such language barrier, the Islanders did negotiate truces. 

Examples of overkill were frequent. A middle-aged man, Burial 21, had been hit with 19 flints; projectiles were found in the top of his pelvis, his forearm, his lower leg, his rib cage, and the base of his neck. One young woman, Burial 44, had been hit with 21 flints; three of these were probably the barbs of a spear that penetrated her face and reached the base of her skull. Nor were children spared. Two youngsters interred together, Burials 13 and 14, had flints in their neck vertebrae, each probably representing a coup de grâce.


If they cared for the woman, why rape the woman.

Killing women and raping them restores honor
There was a really good documentary about Banaz Mahmod honor killing case 10 years back
is pretty good in understanding about this honor stuff
It stems from that women our property so we will never let our property go away it belongs to us
Banaz Mahmod was 16 when she was married to some 40 year old man in United Kingdom
He raped her, she started to meet the other guy, then she left that 40 year pdfile, and then she was raped by her own &quot;cousins&quot; one by one and then killed
so this process let the Iraqi family restore their honor in the society and family back home in iraq
Western Countries need to save themselves from this crap and extremism
Such concept of &quot;Honor&quot; is still widely exists in (South)Asia, Arab, Africa
just few days back a father killed her daughter and her boyfriend to save the honor
such backward ass ideology needs to be thrown out of this country and also out of this world

She hobbled over to where Mandri stood. She held the torch up over his head, then waved it from side to side, as if the light playing over his features revealed something truer about him than simple fear. When her eyes flitted towards his stomach he realized what she was really looking at. What she really studied were the threads of purpose binding him to everything else, binding him to Obo. He knew that she could see them, even if he could not, and she studied them with an artist’s eye. While the artist’s eye is the same as the lover's eye, it’s also the same as the covetous eye, the jealous eye, the hateful eye, it is noticing to remember, often called beholding, and Mandri did not like to be held by anyone, much less a sneering old crone with a wild eye peering up at him from under the shadow of her cowl.

In his enthusiasm and need, has made some very strange statements.

Third, it's not that atheists reject otherwise convincing evidence on a technicality. We reject evidence that is rational to reject and that everyone rejects when it's not about their particular set of beliefs.
If beauty, meaning, experience, and all the things you listed were valid evidence, we'd have to accept all religions as true, even when they say contradictory things (and no, perennialism doesn't solve this, as perennialism believes that religions share some truths, not that they are all true.) This &quot;evidence&quot; would prove even atheism, as an atheist can reasonably claim that there is beauty and meaning in rational skepticism.
Now, to your question. Humanity is valuable because it's valuable to us. Yes, it's subjective, but subjective doesn't mean random. Subjective values are what we live for. Love is clearly subjective - you and I don't love the same people - but we would die for our spouses and children.

            <Text>Under his feet were some holes burrowed by some strange species of yellow-headed lizard. At night those lizards escaped from their haunts and searched for food. He could see them silhouetted against the starry sky. Their mounds were covered with picked cleaned bones of all manner of mouse, lizard, ground-nesting birds, and berrybush.
He wondered if these lizard mounds had once been cities. There were lizard mounds lining to the horizon it seemed, and beyond that to the ends of the earth.
A distant lizard sent forth a screaming hiss into the night. Other lizards from other lizard cities immediately took up his challenge, and for a good few hands the peace of the starry sky was upset by the hissing, hacking, and crying of those foul, foul beasts. </Text>

            <Text>It was the middle of night when they reached the end of the Tib. Mandri was so happy that he collapsed in prayer. Everyone was ecstatic—everyone but Ayram. His fretful eye studied the north.
“Looking for Hrks,” he said.
They might have made it out of the Tib, but they hadn’t yet survived the danger. Still, their mood was good and doubly so because in the near east was full up with the brown peaks of the Goree mountains. Those mountains had arrived all at once, a long, dark lumpy line looming on the horizon.
The Ayramun picked themselves up and quickened their pace, practically jogging along for the Goree had no hills. Instead it was flat, red-iron dirt all the way up to the mountain chain’s base. The red mountains themselves were buttresses against the desert wind, and as such their rock faces bore the scars of its fury—deep, scoring cuts that swept up and over them.
Ayram led them south in line with these mountains, towards the Goree Pass.
Mandri asked Purl how Ayram knew where they were relative to the Pass.
“He remembers it,” said Purl, as if that were a perfectly adequate explanation. Mandri knew that Ayram couldn’t have dead-reckoned it all the way from that little desert temple near Minting Rock. The featureless Tib would have made that impossible, and the arc of the sun was more of a guideline than a precise measure.
He considered asking the man himself, but decided not to, and good thing too, because the next person who spoke drew Ayram’s ire.
It was Seb.
He had to poop.
Ayram shushed him, but Seb insisted.
“You’re the one that made me eat those flies!” Seb said.
“Alright!” Ayram exclaimed, and he stopped the train. “We’ll make a short camp here. Be quick and quiet.”
“It ain’t gonna be quiet, I can tell ya that. Matter of fact, ain’t gonna be quick, either.”
Seb sauntered off towards the mountains, and disappeared amongst the shadows of rocks.
Mandri dumped Obo onto the ground, then went to Moto and asked for some twigs to make a fire to calm the night chill.
“No fires,” said Ayram. “We’ve got to be quiet, and we’ve got to pass unseen.”
“It’s not only Hrks we’re worried about,” Moto added. “If you don’t know, the Goree’s cursed. If that doesn’t get you, there’s two kinds of tribes in the Goree—those who want to kill you, and those who want to steal all your stuff. Either way, you end up dead.”
“Won’t they have seen us coming from miles away?”
“There’s not much reason for them to be watching the Tib, because it’s not a journey often made. We might have slipped through and if we have, we don’t want to spoil it with a fire.”
“Well, how close are we to the Pass?”
“We’ll be upon it morning,” said Ayram.
“The light of day?”
“Yes.”
“But you just said that everyone wants to kill us.”
“The Goree pass is protected ground, so long as you pass in the day.”
“And who enforces that law?” Obo asked.
“Custom.”
Obo laughed, and this drew a dirty look from Moto. Moto said,  “Custom may mean nothing to you, but desert customs demand respect amongst outland tribes. They have preserved us for thousands of years. Every tribesman knows that if they violate the truce of the Goree Pass, then they are dead.”
Obo said, with ebullient eyes, “I didn’t laugh because I doubted you. I laughed because I believed you.”
“Well, I don’t believe him,” said Mandri.
“But you should,” said Obo.
“No desert custom is going to stop people from looking out for themselves.”
“Have you ever heard of the Old Believers?” Obo asked.
“The who?”
“Elrahet mentioned them a few days ago. The Old Believers  lived in an alluvial plain just south of Cask. They had strange ways of worshiping Solraheen, so to incorporate them into the Hrkan world we had to reform their religion. The plan was to do it piecemeal, over generations, so as not to cause a stir. Don’t start with the religion itself, start with some of their customs to soften them up. The first thing we did is we told them to not write Solraheen with two L’s.”
“So?”
“Guess what they did.”
“They didn’t want to do it.”
“They built warehouses out of resin-rich timber, locked themselves inside, and then burnt them all down. An entire tribe of ten-thousand people killed themselves in one night. They killed themselves and their children over a single L. If you ever make it to Jeket’s library, you should look for a book on the histories of the Old Believers.”
“I’m not going to do that.”
“Outland tribes are tickled by custom.”
Elrahet had been sitting silently by herself, brooding as she’d been want to do since they’d entered the Tib. The next words she spoke were her first in several days. “You’re the Mazid that killed the Old Believers?”
“Are you not listening?” said Obo. “They killed themselves.”
Elrahet turned her back. Ayram said that was enough noise for the night, and they took up shelter behind a jumble of boulders which blocked the western wind. Ayram shared some stern words with Seb when he got back from his fecal excursion. All save the giant lay down to rest.</Text>

            <Title>King Sixa's Column</Title>
            <Text>One afternoon they stumbled upon a smooth black column sticking up out of the sand—plain granite, not Fabled Black
You should read it,” said Seb. “It’s gotta sign on the bottom. Funniest shit I ever heard.”
Mandri wandered around the column’s base, while the Ayramun lounged for a while in the column’s long shadow. Since Mandri couldn’t read Old Jandri, he had to turn around and let Obo translate the words graven into a stone plaque.
“The first bit is too scuffed to read,” said Obo, “But the rest says, ‘Things are said of her Kings that are shameful to relate, in particular regarding Sixa the Very Great, the first King whose seat was in Duur. The falseness of those infamous lies can begin to be suspected by noticing that, with refined cunning, they all make reference to alleged incidents that in themselves are unverifiable. Let it hereby be declared and known—Sixa the Very Great never had relations with a cow.”
“They made this whole column to announce this?”
“‘Moreover, King Sixa’s son, King Shura the Extremely Great, who didn’t permit even as Prince that in the temples his errors and sins could be concealed—never hid his true sins and defects. Whoever wishes to know them has only to read his ten-thousandth Kingly Decree or hear his heavenly vision from the good harvest of 1021. In none of these is it revealed that he is the result of mixed breeding.”
“You’re making that up.”
Elrahet was sitting on the column's plinth nearby, and she answered for Obo. “This column wasn’t put up by Shura, it was put up just to make fun of Shura.”
“But why put it in the middle of nowhere?”
“This isn’t the middle of nowhere,” said Elrahet. “This desert was once the womb of cities.” She gestured broadly out at the Sand with her cane. The landscape was raw and subtly colored by a host of stubby, gray-green pencil weeds and crawling bushes. In the distant south was a line of dune-brinks, topped with smoky spindrifts, and in the distant north, flying high, was a flock of wheeling, screaming blackbirds fighting over the scraps of some unseen corpse. There were no cities in it, nor even the ruins of one. 
“Each mound of dirt you see was once a city.”
Every quadrant of the horizon was studded by at least four or five humongous mounds which Mandri had taken to be the natural work of the earth. They were even standing on a mound. The thought that what was under his feet was a city was laughable.
She said, “They aren’t Hrkan cities, mind, these cities here were small and made of clay. Houses of unbaked brick, plastered with clay. Thatched roofs covered with clay. Each year, a fresh coat of clay. The rains come and the clay washes down from the walls and roofs and into the street, so the city grows up and up and up.” She stabbed the mound with her stick. “That’s how it all started.”
From then on, Mandri never called the Sand empty. It was as empty as a graveyard, which is to say, not empty at all.</Text>

            <Title>Godsight</Title>
            <Text>The first floor of the blackstone Western Tower was composed of a single dark hallway running north to south. In the middle of this hall, on either side, were two sets of wide-wood double doors that opened up into large, dust-strewn storage rooms with empty floors. At the end of the hall was a spiraling staircase.
The second floor of the tower was a single enormous room which wrapped around a central pillar. There were two narrow windows in this room, one which looked west, towards the corpse-strewn courtyard and the Goree Pass, and the other looked east, out towards the desert and the Hrkan line. This desert view was obstructed by the rim-lit silhouettes of the Ayramun as they jostled with each other to get a better look at the Hrkan horse and rider.
Ayram and  Elrahet were somewhere out there, ready to meet the fate they’d bought with the lives of their companions.
Mandri watched all this from his seat on the staircase. When he was sure no one would notice, he ducked down into the dark of the first floor to dab one meager droplet of juice from the God’s Eye burgeon onto his tongue—no more than that. The idea was to escape himself, not end up catatonic like before. He then plugged the tiny hole he’d made in the burgeon with a rolled up sliver of woolen rag, and he stuffed the blessed burgeon into the pocket of his sleeve to save for later. If he rationed it carefully, he reasoned, he could make the juice last for a week. The rest he’d roll flat and dry out, and from there he’d experiment to discover the best method of ingestion. He wouldn’t rule anything out. Then, he would steal another.
He sat down on the fourth stair-step and waited there in the dark for the burgeonsight to take hold. He knew it wouldn’t take long.
“Where’s Mandri?” Purl asked from above.
Mandri hid his disappointment well when he said, “I’m down here!”
He didn’t want his absence noted, lest Seb put two and two together, so he climbed back up stairs to join the others.
Purl was the only one who wasn’t glued to the western window. She was sitting against the curving wall, still strapped into her pack. 
“Don’t take it off,” she said to Mandri when she noticed him starting to unshoulder his own burden. 
“Why not?”
“We need to be ready to run.”
“It only takes a second to put it on.”
“Leave it on,” said Purl, demanding.
“Fine.” 
Mandri plopped himself down right next to Purl, pack and all. He leaned into her and said, “Do you have any idea how we’re supposed to get out of this?”
“Ayram has a plan,” she said flatly, as if she didn’t believe it either.
“Didn’t seem like it to me. His words, if I recall, were, ‘I’ll figure it out’.”
“When he says that it’s because he knows we won’t like the plan.”
“I see.”
“Why are you sweating?”
“I’m stressed. And my pack is heavy.”
“But it’s cold in here.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t know.”
He wasn’t about to admit that he’d just swallowed a single milky tear of a God’s Eye burgeon, and it was making his heart skip beats. Strangely, it wasn’t doing anything for his vision.
Purl saw him sigh and asked, “Are you that worried about the Mazid?”
“You mean Obo?”
“The first time I saw that Mazid, I watched it kill thirty Ayramun.”
“Wasn’t that the fault of his Minder?”
“He still should have apologized. At least, he shouldn’t be a prick about it.”
“I think there’s only so much you can expect from a Sparkless Mazid. They’re deceitful…prideful…irritating.”
“And ugly,” said Purl.
Mandri sank back into his pack, which was quite comfy to lean into with all the new additions. “Somehow, it’s all part of Obo’s charm. Like, somehow, if you take all those things together they all cancel each other out and it’s not so bad. Or maybe it’s just that everybody hates him and that’s why I’m drawn to him. It’s like, I mean…I don’t know…we get along.”
That droplet from the God’s Eye burgeon wasn’t doing anything to lighten his mood. It wasn’t expanding the ceiling into infinity, it wasn’t swirling the colors of the floor. It certainly wasn’t tamping down on the feeling of guilt that was stirring way down in his stomach. His legs were heating up.
He considered spritzing his tongue with some more of that burgeon juice, then decided against it. He should be bearing witness to Obo’s final waking moments—and they were his final moments, because even if this little gambit succeeded, there was no way the Ayramun were going to make it all the way to Jeket, much less free Solraheen. If he didn’t walk to that tower window and watch, then the memory of Obo’s passing would be the sole property of people who didn’t care.
Mandri shuffled his legs underneath him into a frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up.
“Going to watch?” Purl asked.
“Might as well.”
 There wasn’t room enough for him at the window, between all those excited elbows. Then Moto decided that he was needed down below, so he left, and Mandri was able to squeeze himself into the picture before Seb and Moteah could close ranks.
He peered out over the sprawl of back shattered rocks leading out into the bright red desert, and after a moment of admiring the glow of day, and wondering when the God’s Burgeon would arrive, he blinked, and a rainbow light flashed across his vision.
He gasped and shut his eyes, but closed, his sight was flooded by that rainbow light, and it churned, and churned against his lids, forcing his eyes back open. Now his vision was a burst of color, pulsing through the spectrum—first red, into orange, and on, and on, and when this faded, the world was not the same as it was before.
What he saw was akin to burgeonsight, only far greater, for more than glistening surfaces he saw the fibrous iridescent light of unveiled purpose shining out from under the skin of every surface. This white-yet-spectrumed light was swimming under the sand, churning in the tower’s shadow, breathing out the tower itself. Tufted strands sparkled up out of the black stone of the window-sill underneath Mandri’s fingers—every element here and was bristling with the flighty colored fibers of purpose, and these fibers took flight and were hereby joined in Mandrameen’s eye, for his sight was the spindle that bound them together into a thread that wound back out through his widened iris and into the world, a yarn spun tight, a continuous threading and rethreading of purpose.
Threads of scintillating spectrumed light swirled out of the stomachs of the figures below—there winding out of Ayram and Elrahet, out of the horse, out of its blue-robed rider and black-robed Riga child.
Mandri caught his breath and realized time itself had stopped. The figures below were stuck in dynamic, limb-bent postures, seemingly fixed by the brilliant thread into a pyramidal frame—Ayram and Elrahet anchored bottom corners, the scribe on his white horse towered into a point. This was true purpose here, and where the purpose was strongest, the threads burned white. They keeling into the scribe, for he did not represent Hrkan power advantaged on a proud steed, he was that power, and in his lap was the Riga child, the very embodiment of Hrk’s assault on the sanctity of creation. White threads swirled around Ayram, who was not a symbol of the outland peoples, he was their paragon. Glowing brightest were all those threads connected to Elrahet, who was herself the very essence of the Sand given agency. Lying on the ground, woven into the middle of this divine tapestry, was Mazidobo, a creature constructed for the sole purpose of setting the affairs of humanity in order, and look where he was, destitute in the dirt, scarred and cowering and naked. The others looked past him as if he weren’t there at all.
Mandri lamented the lack of materials. If he’d only had a stick of charcoal and a board he could start sketching then and there. The urge to do so was overwhelming, for the scene was pleading with him to be given its own sacred body, a painting in a frame, an object to which the iridescent threads of the moment’s purpose could move about the world and inject their meaning into every future moment.
If he didn’t sketch it out now as he saw it, details would be forgotten. After one night’s sleep they'd be lost forever.
He was forced instead to imprint the scene upon his mind as best he could. He kept his eye jumping from detail to detail and back again, and then back again, and again, and again, and at each stop he beheld the object—an act beyond mere noticing. This was the artist's noticing, the lover's noticing, covetous noticing, jealous noticing, noticing to remember. Beholding not a lossless art, but what gets lost has chance of being reconstructed later.
He ran through the details again like a common sundry list.
The arc of the tower’s shadow splitting the scene in half. 
The coolness of color inside that shadow and its subtle, sumptuous grays, almost blue.
The size disparity between Ayram and Elrahet—both dark and shrouded in that tower’s shadow. 
The wind flicked hem of Elrahet’s desert-bitten robe.
The Hrkan horse, a splendid white horse—white as chalk. It’s brushed muscles glistened in the light of the sun. It’s neck was as wide as Ayram’s shoulders. It’s richly braided half-flicked in anxiousness.
Sitting in the brown saddle was the Hrkan scribe. His dark skin was reddened and glistening with kell oil. The trail of his blue robe was filigreed with golden leaves. His right arm cradled the black-bundled Riga with care. 
Obo on the ground. Pale. Fly-swatted. Staring at the sky. So perfect was the staging that the warm spectral edge of the tower's penumbra cut right across his stomach. 
The rest of the world—the black tower bricks, the mush of shattered rock and sand—these were static things and could be ignored because they could be revisited later. It was an injustice, abstracting them out as if they weren't bound by the bristling with purpose, but Mandri knew it was more than he could manage.
He ran through the details again, though his eyelids were feeling heavy. He noticed that in all this time he hadn’t blinked.
He shouldn’t blink.
He should keep them open.
Notice the arc of the tower’s shadow—that hadn't changed.
Ayram and Elrahet still stood resolute.
The horse hadn’t even shifted it’s weight. It’d been standing on two feet this whole time. Wonderful. 
He licked his lips. His mouth was dry. Burgeons have a way of doing that.
A new detail—the white line of Hrkan soldiers hanging in the distance. It would take a large canvas to accommodate them, and a lot of paint. He twinged at the thought having to fill up so large a frame.
Should he include the light of purpose? How to paint it?
He would have to worry about that later. The details need accounting.
A new detail—Ayram’s spear—how had he missed it? The dark tip of that spear formed an unsightly tangent with the horse’s leather stirrup, such that the stirrup and accompanying harness seemed to sprout out from the spear’s haft. This element would need to be fixed. It flattened the image. Mandri could adjust the angle of the bar in Ayram’s hand so that it needn’t intersect with the stirrup at all.
Would it be sacrilegious to alter this image in any way?
Was the angle of the spear part of the purpose?
Did he miss anything?
Yes, there was a vulture up in the sky. Mandri wished it wasn’t there, because a vulture circling the scene was too on the nose. People might start to think that this was all his own doing. Maybe he should remove the vulture.
No, that would be a step too far. 
He would have to include the vulture.
A new detail—sound. And now that he noticed it, all the sounds of the scene were coming at him in one long exhale. The faint scream of the vulture. The wind whistling over the mountains. The sparkling swish of whipping sand. A shrill whistle.
A whistle?
The Riga’s whistle.
He blinked, and suddenly the scene smashed into him. He shut his eyes and yelped, for the Riga’s shrill split into his head . He opened his eyes again just in time to see Obo’s gray Spark zipping out of his body and into the Riga’s mouth. Then Ayram roared, charged, and stabbed at the scribe with his spear. The scribe’s horse whinnied in fright, and reared as its rider was skewered up under his ribs.
“Mandri!”
The call had come from behind him.
He spun around and was surprised to find that Moteah and Seb were no longer squeezing against his shoulders, in fact, they weren’t even in the room. Gone, too, was the iridescent light of purpose that flooded his vision—there was only the stark, cold interior of the tower’s second level, deserted save for Purl who stood waist deep in the stairwell across the room. Her face was alight with wide-eyed urgency. “Come on!” she shouted, and then she ducked away down the stairs.
Mandri blinked in confusion.
He spun back around to the window so that he could narrate for Purl the magnificence of the scene below, but Ayram was already running back towards the tower, with Elrahet’s head popping out of the top of his backpack. Obo, and the Riga were gone. The Hrkan scribe lay flat on his stomach, face down into a thickening pool of his own blood. His frightened steed was charging hard into the emptiness of open desert. The Hrkan soldiers beyond had spread themselves out into a long white line—a net of swords marching towards the tower in double time. 
“Well, shit,” Mandri muttered.
Fear gripped him. He ran as fast as could towards the stairs, but each step was a chore for his limbs were thick with the lethargy left by the passing of the God’s Eye sight.
He staggered down the stairs and into the darkness of the first floor hallway. Here, the true bewilderment set in and his stomach turned. His throat made to vomit—his chest heaved three violent times, but the only thing to come of this wrenching were stray strings of spittle. He thanked Solraheen for the closeness of the cold stone walls, else he might not have managed to stumble out into the tower’s gateway tunnel.
“What are you doing!?” Purl shouted.
She had been waiting for him in the courtyard with the pilgrims.
“Hurry up!” she shouted.
Mandri followed her and fixed his eyes on the wheel-rutted path, thinking as best he could about his next step instead of the horror of the scene around him. That captivating light of purpose was nowhere to be seen around these poles. They weren’t anywhere. They had well and truly gone.
Mandri shouted, “It was incredible!”
Purl didn’t listen.
He chased her into the shadow of that god-stricken cleft of earth called the Goree Pass.</Text>

            <Title>The Tib</Title>
            <Text>They came at last to a moundless plain covered in a sticky bush that was called, unsurprisingly, stickbush. This plain led to the Tib desert, which was one of the Sand’s eight portions all unto itself. It was called the Black Portion, for it was a flat, empty, expanse with a hard floor of small stones tarred in black rock-varnish. These stones were set into the earth, as tightly interlocked as any Hrkan mosaic. It looked a bit like the core of a Hrkan road before dirt was dumped on top to make it smooth.
Before they crossed into the Tib, Ayram had them all pull out as many stickbushes as they could carry. Mandri was told it was for wood to make fire. Everyone picked ridiculous amounts and tied them onto their packs. Obo was practically buried in them. They looked like a family of giant hedgehogs, though no one joked about it as the mood was getting bleak because everyone, even Ayram, was tired.
The first hand of the Tib was wonderful, for the perfectly flat and solid ground was a welcome change from the gently rising and falling stretches before. But this pleasure did not outlive the noon-day sun. The rocks underfoot were hot enough to blister bare skin, a toe was burned even if it slipped off the shoe for a single step.
More than any other part of the desert, the Tib was endless. They walked it, heading south and east, and after two days nothing changed. It was always the same endless black plain and empty sky. 
They tried to sleep two hands every night because they were too exhausted to walk right through it. And they had to sleep huddled around twiggy fires made from their stick bushes. It wasn’t the heat that provided comfort, though the nights were cold, it was the smell, for suspended above these miniature fires were tin bowls filled with a scented wax, smelling of carrion. In the mornings, the hardened wax would be thick with the fuzzy brown bodies of cusiloe flies, who’d been looking for meat in which to implant their eggs.
The flies live just under the Tib's skin, squeezed deep into the crevices of the interlocking rocks, and the odor of flesh, living or otherwise, drew them from hibernation—but only at night. Like reasonable creatures, they wouldn’t come out to bake in the sun. As soon as the red lip of the sun peeks up in the east, everyone rose and checked themselves to make sure they hadn’t been impregnated. If a fly did get under the skin, and the eggs were allowed to hatch, removing them would be a painful ordeal. Seb described the larvae—pulsing white thumbs with two fangs the length of fingernails. Pull them out and they can rip the flesh and leave a hole that will get infected. 
She said, “You look for them by feeling.”
She said this because skin was too dark to see the soft little welts, especially Moto’s and Moteah's skin. They all had to feel around for a hardened, coin-sized bump, like a callous on the palm. They had to check every inch of their bodies, and since no one can reach their own back, someone else had to do it.
Moteah and Moto checked each other. Ayram and Elrahet checked each other. Mandri was paired with Seb. Neither were happy about the arrangement. Mandri complained about Seb’s borcandi stained fingers. Seb was worried, perhaps rightly so, that Mandri might miss a spot. 
Nobody checked Obo. He said the flies wouldn’t bother him. If they did, he would know.
Before setting off they’d scrape the paste of dead flies from the surface of the wax and save them for food. Then they’d be on their way again, a short sprint in the half-light hours, before the sun became unbearable, and when the sun became unbearable they’d stop, pitch little shelters, and rest until the worst of the heat had passed.
It was a lurching way to travel, and it felt to Mandri that they made no progress. Two more days passed and still the scenery did not change.
To the north, a flat plain of pebbles for as far as the eye could see.
To the south, a flat plain of pebbles for as far as the eye could see.
To the east and to the west it was the same—flat for as far as the eye could see.
For all he knew they were going in a giant circle.
He began to study the chaotic patterns in the cracks on the floor. Once or twice he saw a dotted triangle of lighter pebbles that he’d swore he saw the day before.
Moving like this, out of rhythm and in unfamiliar hours, skating on the surface of an endless black stone sea, changed his perception of time. There were no new spikes of memory around which a moment could congeal. No new sounds, and no new conversations, because the heat of the day and the cold of night tempered everyone into the same person— short responses, shrugging shoulders, faces set in the same tight-lipped frown that said, “I just want to get through it”. And that’s who everyone was, bundled, muddled balls of just-get-through-it.
Except for Obo, of course. Obo remained genial and solicitous.
Everyone hated him.</Text>

            <Title>Misanthrope Obo</Title>
            <Text>There was the common thread to Obo’s now daily lectures—he didn’t think highly of humans. As the days wore on he talked more and more about what ridiculousness people got up to without the guiding light of governance.
He spoke of how, in the distant age of temple cities, there was an Old Jandri custom that forbade anyone from selling land. The purpose was good-natured, as the wise sages of those cities had enough history to know what causes a city’s collapse—wealth attracts wealth just as sand attracts sand, and inevitably the wealthiest end up with everything, all the money, and all of the land. Since the larger mass of people have nothing, they either leave or simply rebel. 
To combat this, the city sages decided to prevent the sale of land so that a family could persist for generations regardless of what the rich wolves were up to. They instituted a law stating that land could be had only through inheritance, that way fruitful land stays in the family, regardless of whether the family is rich or poor. If a childless couple found their work too heavy in their old age, they could adopt a few straight-backed persons to till their fields and reap the harvests, and these surrogate children could stand to inherit on the condition that they provided grain, oil, and clothes to their adoptive parents for as long as the old folks lived.
But the rich were too clever for it. Judges were bribed, councils were captured, and by hook or by crook they weaseled their way into the lines of succession. This practice carried on for more than one hundred years in the heart of Old Jandri. What began as a few rich, wicked schemers evolved into wicked consortiums of ‘sons’ who shared pools of silver and gold from which poor landowners were forced to turn to in times of drought, signing over the birthright of their trueborn children to the rich. Such was the depravity that a single man was once the adopted child of five-hundred and fifty-two different sets of parents. 
According to Obo, this was the birth of the Old Jandri banking system. The pretense of adoption was eventually shed, and more sophisticated systems of accumulation were devised. It wasn’t overthrown until the Hrks put a stop to it. Of course, the Hrks brought systems all their own, but the point illustrated how cutting through depravity requires someone to literally cut through it, else it will fester.</Text>

            <Title>Epilogue</Title>
            <Text>No one spoke as they fled through the dark tunnels of the world. At least, Mandri never heard anyone speak. If Moteah or Moto gave voice to some practical concern, he wasn’t aware of it, for all his senses seemed so far away. He could not feel his feet squeeze inside his shoes as he ran. His palm did not tingle when he braced himself against cold and clammy stone. He was a passenger inside his own body. His own breathing seemed like someone else’s. It took tremendous effort to reassert his Self and swivel his eyes to study the iridescent threads of purpose which guided him through the dark. It was so much effort that he did it once and never again. He was content to follow wherever those threads led. And of course, it led him upwards, towards the world’s surface. Mandri’s only worries were the suspicious stares from Moto and Moteah. He thought they gripped their swords a little too tightly. 
Eventually, his purpose led him to a small, shit-stained hole that some lizards had hewn. He belly crawled through it and emerged into the night of the desert. The twinkling sky was a magnificent blue and the clean air was invigorating. He stood up, brushed off the grit which clung to his sleeves, chest, and knees, and then he closed his eyes and took a deep, neck-stretched breath. The soreness and exhaustion his body was experiencing would have bulled him over if he weren’t dwelling in his own periphery. Then he opened his eyes and found himself standing atop a plateau in the Goree mountains. 
To the south he spied the distant silhouette of the temple Shulgi set against the blue of night. He could blot it out with his thumb.
To the west was the sand blanketed world. The Tib blacked the rim of the horizon.
“Out of the way,” Moto grumbled as he pulled himself out of the hole. When he was all the way out and standing, he took a deep breath, just as Mandri had done.
“I’ll light a fire,” he said.
Long stalks of woody haggas weed grew out of stone-cracks nearby, and Moto gathered these while Mandri pulled Moteah’s pack out through the hole. When Moteah was out and standing, she was quick to snatch her pack back from him. 
She was wary of him. Mandri desperately wanted to laugh, but somehow, he couldn’t. He simply stood there, staring at her Spark like a freak, and he stood like this until Moto built a respectable fire. Once the flames were crackling, Moto permitted them all to sit.
Moteah retrieved from her pack a rare treat—two small bricks of cappash, which was a dried and minced lizard meat spiced with bitter herbs and caked in yellowed fat. She handed one of these to Mandri and said, “You look like you need it.”
Whatever force controlling Mandri’s body accepted the offering. He nibbled on a corner, thinking there’d be no taste—he couldn’t feel the weight of his own body, much less the saliva in his mouth. And at first there was no taste, but with the second chew, the meat’s musty flavor percolated into being. Somehow the act of eating was pulling him back into his own skin. Every swallow slumped him further and further into his body’s exhaustion. 
“Sol’s light, I’m tired,” he mumbled between mouthfuls. “I don’t suppose we could take some time to sleep?”
“No sleep,” said Moto, who wasn’t eating anything. He was sitting cross-legged, hunched, appreciating the fire between them. His sword sat gleaming in his lap. “We need to talk.”
Mandri licked his teeth and said, “I know.”
Of where to begin.
“Do you know my story, Mandri?”
“I’ve already told him,” Moteah said.
“He knows that an Amalgamete killed our people?”
She nodded.
Moto had his hands up now, as if to frame the significance of what he was about to say. 
“Mandri, I saw you do some things that were not wise. And I saw that evil witch…she said some things that were concerning. Then you went and drank from her stomach. Mandri, she called you the Amalgamete.”
He paused to make sure that Mandri understood what he was implying.
Mandri did. “If you want to kill me,” he said, “I would understand.”
Moto’s lips drew tight and he nodded, a tacit admittance of his obvious desire. He said to his sister, “Don’t look at me like that.” She was looking at him like he’d already cut Mandri down. “This could be it,” he said. “Kill him and we could be done. Evil would be gone and dead for good.”
Moteah narrowed her eyes. “We don’t know what Solraheen has planned for him.”
“Solraheen is dead.”
“But so is Schisol,” Moteah countered. “And so is the Amalgamete.”
Moto gripped his knees, and he shook his head for the burden of having to explain was almost too much. “Mandri is the Amalgamete. He killed Elrahet. He swallowed Sparks. We’ll be next. Then the world.”
Moteah did not deny him. She looked to Mandri, stern as ever, a clear demand that he should defend himself.
“I didn’t kill Elrahet,” Mandri said.
“Oh?” said Moto. “So she stabbed herself with your sword, is that it?”
“No.”
Moto snorted his annoyance. “Mandri, I’m going to kill you. You’re going to need to answer to the best of your ability. Mighty words. Do you understand?”
“All I can say is the truth. Elrahet could see the future. She could see her own death. If she wanted to stop it, she would have.”
Moto scoffed at this suggestion. “Elrahet wanted to die? A woman who lived a hundred ages wanted to die?”
When Mandri didn’t answer, Moto leaned forward and put more force into his question. “What reason would she have for letting you of all people kill her? She outlived the gods. She fought off kings of demons and men, but you are the one to fulfill her purpose?”
Mandri’s voice always found his arguments as easily as a swordsman’s fingers found their sword, but at present, his tongue was fumbling. And to make matters worse, the more he thought about who Elrahet was and why she did what she did, the more he was squeezed back into his body’s periphery. The last thing he felt as he slipped out of his face was a warm vibration in his cheeks, and then a snap of cold ran through him.
Moteah’s eyes lit up, and excitement lifted her cheeks. “Elrahet would have seen what her own death would bring. Think about it—the last Amalgamete is dead, and so is Schisol’s shadow. Elrahet must have seen this end and accepted it.”
Moto eyed his sister with slack-jawed disbelief. “Did you not see that evil bitch cut out her own stomach? She could see the future too, couldn’t she? Why would she do such a thing if she couldn’t see how it would end?”
His question hung in the air unanswered, and when he saw that Mandri would never answer, he stood up and brandished his sword. Moteah pulled on his robe as he swept by her. She said, “What if he isn’t the Amalgamete, and that evil witch only said that he was to get you to kill him? What if he’s here to bring good?”
Moto stopped cold and considered this complication. But he sneered his way through it and pushed his sister aside to step towards Mandri. He swipe-flicked his blade through the air to remember its weight, and he set its edge to Mandri’s neck.
“Give me a reason not to kill you,” he snarled.
Mandri spoke, and his own voice frightened him, for it was not him who was speaking. The sound was his, and the cadence too, but the force of the words were someone else’s.
“I can see the future, too,” he said as he stared into the soft glow of Moto’s Spark. “I see threads of purpose. They have always run in front of our Selves so that the gods might weave our purpose, but the gods are dead. Our purpose now, is ours alone. This is what Elrahet wanted. This is what Solraheen wanted.”
“They want me to let you live?”
“No,” Mandri said calmly. “They want you to be free to do what you want—nothing more or less.”
“And what of the evil witch whose Spark you swallowed?” The edge in Moto’s voice was as sharp as his blade. 
It did not bother Mandri.
“She wants the same as the others,” he said. “They all want you to do what you want. Elrahet believes you will want what is right, Pel thinks she knows you better.”
Moto sneered at the implication that he was in any way predictable. No one could know which way his sword would cut except for him. And it seemed for a moment that he might strike back.
But Moto would not kill Mandrameen.
This did not mean that Moto did not want to do it. It was clear from his unwavering gaze and firmly planted feet that he did. But in the breath before he delivered his final stroke of judgment, a paralyzing uncertainty dumbed his features and stayed his hand. Mandri saw a thin thread of purpose drawing Moto’s sword away.
Moto clenched his teeth and hissed.
Mandri watched with fascination as Moto struggled against the most merciless of uncertainties—uncertainty of consequence—that bane of progress, that womb of fear. A single cup of this uncertainty could dissolve the resolve of an entire nation. 
Kill Mandri, and Moto might save or doom the world in equal measure. Or, Mandri could be of no consequence at all.
Who was he to know?
The turmoil played on Moto’s face, and his dropped guard let Mandri see his true Self clearly, for floating inside that fear of consequence was mercy and compassion, the signs of a Spark yearning to understand and be understood. 
Moto stepped back and sheathed his sword. “Come, Moteah. We’re leaving.”
This simple command shattered Mandri’s equanimity more than the threat of death, for in slipped the fear of being left alone. Mandri knew that if he were left alone in this vast expanse that his Self would blur beyond all hope for reassembly. And with Mandrameen lost, what would he become? Even now, a presence pulled at the veil behind his eyes, and it clutched at his throat. He was forced to clench his gut to squeeze out a single word, a word which he had never said and thought he never would.
“Help.”
Moto’s skepticism was cold.
Moteah’s empathy was warm. 
Both their Sparks were near and infinitely separate.
Mandri wanted to draw them closer.
He wanted to keep them apart.
He smiled at the thought that he could mean such different things to different people, and he sobbed at the realization that all he was, and all he’d ever been, was that very difference.
He begged them both to stay, for he could never be lost so long as someone else was present. And in the end, they agreed, though Moto was sure to add, “We’ll think better in the sun.” So, they waited for the sun to rise and bring the fresh white light of day. Maybe then they would know what to do.</Text>

He thought about cooking a nice, meaty, white-tail soup.
He was running through the dark, fleeing from the sight of hunting demons, and he was thinking about soup. He’d never cooked a white-tail soup before in his life. He’d never even thought about it. Maybe he had in passing, but it was never something that he couldn’t get past. His mind’s eye was filled with a vision of flaky white meat spiced with bitter herbs, all swimming in a creamy yellow broth.</Notes>

            <Title>Solgi Erg</Title>
            <Text>The evening sun brought them out of the storm’s deep-sand wake and onto solid clay. This was still officially part of the Sand’s Pitted Portion, though there were no pits. There were scraggly bushes and a few stunted trees with wavy trunks. Ayram propped his great pack up against one of these miniature, leaf-bare trees, and then he lay up underneath it to squeeze in a short rest. He permitted Seb to build a smokeless fire. Mandri felt smart in reminding everyone that a Mazidariga didn’t need smoke to find them, and he was told that the Hrks were not the only people from which they needed to hide.
They sat around the fire, watching the sun set. They munched on hardtack, and Mandri was allowed a swig of wine that tasted like sour beer. They conversed about the terrain ahead and the difficulties they might face. Conversation turned to the Great Solgi Erg. The Great Erg was not in their way, but any fireside chat about the Sand’s features cannot end without mentioning it at least once. 
 Mandri made the mistake of calling it the Solgi Erg. 
“The Great Solgi Erg,” Moteah corrected.
“My apologies.”
“Plenty of ergs in the sand, only one of them is Great. Elrahet knows the story of the Erg’s creation.” She said this with some enthusiasm, as if yearning to hear it again.
Elrahet simply sneered and said, “No man or woman knows the story.”
“But you said—”
“There were old memories, memories said to have come straight from the mouth of Solraheen—those memories are lies. No truth survives unscathed from the age when Solraheen shaped His voice into word, for that age was long before the corruption of signs and symbols. The story I know is one shaped by memory, and memory is one big belly-aching lie.”
“But what about—”
“Solraheen made those mountains of sand a long time ago,” Elrahet said, completely ignoring Moteah’s stammering. “That is all that can be said for the truth of the Great Erg. Everything else is in doubt. The very name is in doubt. You know that line of sand as the Great Solgi Erg for you were brought up in this Solitant infested world, but that sand has other names. Older names. Which is the true name? Who can say?”
Mandri admired the old woman’s stamina. She’d been walking all day, and here she was, charging through the telling of a story.
She said, “The Solitants claim that Solraheen planted a stick in the ground to mark one of His garden’s eight corners. Then He left. He left that stick in the ground. Where did He go? Only Sol-knows-where. They say He left to pace out the rest of His garden. They say His passing along the surface of the world kicked up the first wind, the Shulsai, and this wind circled the earth and came back around to puff upon that planted stick. 
“The Shulsai blew sand against the stick, and soon an egg of a sand dune built up in the stick’s lee. Nine moons later, and that fledgling dune had grown up to swallow the stick whole. All it took was that one stick, and it birthed the first dune, and this dune grew, and grew, and grew until it was named the Primal Erg, and it was belly-full, rolling across the world, leaving littler ergs in its wake. It rolled all the way to the edge of land, and there it stopped. It has been bleeding into the sea ever since, half the size of what it once was. Now we call it the Great Solgi Erg.”
“Now Mandri,” Moteah said when Elrahet began to nibble at the edge of a wafer of hardtack. “Do you think Solraheen meant to do it? Do you think He knew that after planting that stick in the ground, that a whole sand sea would swell up around it? Did He make the erg on purpose?”
“I don’t think Solraheen makes mistakes,” said Mandri.
“Yessss,” said Elrahet, hissing like a snake. “Yes, that’s what the Solitants say. They call it the Solgi Erg, because Solgi means, ‘Sol’s gift’. Yet I heard it called the Great Solzima Erg, and zima means—do you know what it means?”
“No.”
“It means shame. It is named ‘Sol’s shame’, because it is a mistake. If Solraheen had intended for the erg to form, He would have built it up with his own two hands as He did with everything else in His garden. And why should He want to turn fertile black earth into a mountain of useless sand? These Old Believers could not believe that Solraheen would wander off into the middle of the world and shape lakes that reflect the light of the divine, fill them with creatures of unfathomable grace and beauty, and yet, at the same time, He would leave the Erg to struggle up on its own, a basic sameness of stuff with no redeeming qualities. All the erg did was procreate and ripple the wind. Hah! Same could be said for Hrks!”
Her excited, toothless smile settled into a deep and easy sneer. “Old Believers claim that when Solraheen returned to the stick that He’d stuck in Jandri’s eastern rib, and when He saw the Erg standing there, He fell into a deep despair. It would take eons to clean up those dunes, even for Him. So He created the Buggal wind to blow it away, and then He left.”
“Well, that’s not the story that I’ve been told,” said Mandri.
“Oh? Enlighten me, young Lord.”
“I couldn’t do the story justice.”
“Have you ever seen the Erg for yourself?” 
“I have seen it. From the water.”
Elrahet chuckled. “From the water, he says! You’ve been bit by Solitants, boy. Yes, I know their story. See how Solraheen’s golden light shimmers across Sand, they say. And think of the variety! Tidal dunes in the lee of hills, echoing dunes on the windward side. Crescent dunes, snake dunes, crater dunes rimmed with grass. Go to the Empty Portion and marvel at the rows of arcing dunes marching towards the horizon, or lose your mind at the sight of the perfectly flat and straight ridges line the Seedra. Stripes, domes, lizardfeet, hairpins, scallops, stars, all mounds of sand that vary in size in temperament. It rivals any family of flowers. 
“They say that these dunes are pigment, that the wind is the brush, and that Solraheen’s hand is the hand which sets all things in motion. The Sand is alive, it moves and creates itself—they’re especially fond of saying that. They see the Sand as a Sparked being, alive as much as you and I. The Ergs drift across the desert, eat the rocks, and shit them out behind, the parts they can’t digest. You can hear the dunes howl if you stoop and listen. And the Solitants say all this to sell a lie, they say all you need to do to change the world is to plant a leg in the sand, as Solraheen planted His stick, and the wave you create can become a mountain. It’s a hopeful message. I hope you don’t believe it.”</Text>

            <Title>Pit Cave</Title>
            <Text>The spitting, scrawny woman walking in front of Mandri, the one carrying the ‘unconscious’ Obo, her name was Seb. The man walking behind Mandri, the short and stout man whose bread wasn’t baked all the way through, his name was Hill, and according to Hill, their two names were the only two things that Mandri needed to know. Don’t bother with ‘why’, or ‘what’s going on’, or ‘I can’t see where I’m going’, the only thing that mattered was that Seb was in front, Hill was behind, and that was the way things were going to be. If Mandri did so much as breathe too loudly for Hill’s comfort, that was sufficient cause for an open handed smack on the back of the head.
Unfortunately, it was impossible for Mandri to avoid making noise because sound carried well in a rock-hewn tunnel, and Mandri’s once-dead-legs were as stiff as rods so every step begged a groan. Every bend of knee felt like a knife stabbing his thigh. Instead of striding through the dark like Hill wanted him to, Mandri shuffled through it on sensitive feet, doing what he could to avoid the trash that littered the floor, and that was hard to do too as well, because the tunnel was a dumping ground.
There was a horde of trash piled all the way up the low ceiling. It was not a place for unshod feet, for hidden in the shadows of the dancing torchlight were the picked-clean bones of small animals scattered amongst splintered balkanut which looked like shattered skulls.  Curved clay shards of wasted jars and all manner of organic waste was the worst of it. Mandri stepped in cold and gooey lumps of muck that glistened when it welled up in between his toes—he couldn’t figure what this substance was until Hill stepped in it, too.
“Black Spark, Seb! Was this you?” Hill was pointing down at a dark stain that soured the toe of his hard leather boot.
Seb shoved Mandri aside so she could get an eye on it.
“Course not,”she protested.
“Why can’t you shit in the hole like everyone else?” Hill challenged.
“It wasn’t me.”
“It’s always you.”
“It was Chopper.”
“It’s always you or Chopper, and since this shit is half green, that means it’s you.”
Seb turned a cold shoulder to Hill’s indignation, and she started off again into the dark. Hill nudged Mandri to follow.
“Don’t play blame games with me,” Seb said as she adjusted Obo’s dead weight on her shoulder. “Who’s the one pilin’ up all this trash in here, huh? Ya know there’s a hole for all this, too, but ya’ll too lazy. Get yourself together fore you come and pick on my habits.” 
Mandri followed along timidly, clutching his wounded right arm against his chest, lest it brush up against the fetid clutter and get infected. He searched the shadow-strewn ground for a clean edge of stone to scrape his shit-stained foot against, but found none. The tunnel was cramped tight with so much junk that the junk itself seemed part of the natural stone. In fact, not one bit of stone could be seen in the flickering torchlight, not even on the low ceiling, for that was mottled over in gray-green moldy growths. All in all it was a loathsome place, and with each step Mandri became more and more convinced that he was back in the good old land of the living, because this was life in all its slovenly, pack-rat glory. Seb picked her way around all this junk as if she’d placed each piece herself, like a pampered toddler wading through scattered toys. On her shoulder, slung like a freshly slaughtered sty-pig, was Obo. His unfortunate nose bobbed in and out of Seb’s armpit with every step.
 It was hard to believe anyone could bring a Mazid down so low, and that these two boorish bandits were involved was inconceivable. Seb herself was as unimposing as an outland poke could be, dirty and hungry looking, with sunken eyes. She looked like desperation itself, and not the dangerous kind of desperation either. She was that sad kind of desperation that Mandri could defeat by simply looking away.
Mandri looked behind at Hill. Hill had his plump pinky finger stuck halfway up his own nose, digging for gold.
Mandri grimaced. “Leave some for me,” he joked.
Hill 's eyes flashed, his cheeks flushed, and he gave Mandri an uncivil punch in the ribs.
“Get going!” he shouted, and Mandri got going. He took two steps, and when that wasn’t hurried enough, Hill shoved him in the back as if that would help. Mandri’s stiff legs couldn’t cope with this crude encouragement and he tumbled forward into Seb’s hips. Then Seb went sprawling, too, and so did Obo. The three of them tumbled together into the glinting darkness.
“You gutwipe!” Seb shouted at Hill.
She rolled over, for she’d landed right on top of Obo. Hill rushed over and spread his torchlight upon the Mazid’s limp form. He studied the Obo’s limbs for breaks and scrapes. The scar on Obo’s chest had popped another stitch.
“Can’t trust you with a feather,” he said to Seb before picking Obo up under his arm. He gestured towards Mandri with his torch. “Take the little dent out to the pit,” he commanded. Then he marched on and disappeared into a sidelong passage, taking his torchlight with him.
“Dark Sparked taker,” Seb muttered after him.
Mandri was sad to see Hill go, as now he was alone with a pokey woman who was grumbling curses in pitch black dark. A hiss and a robe-swish later, and he felt the cold iron point of a dagger prodding his back.
“Don’t you think about tryin’ nothin’ stupid,” Seb said.
“I won’t.”
“What’d I say about talkin’? Now stand up and get movin’.”
Mandri stood up and started to move in the direction he supposed Seb’s dagger wanted him to go. The two of them walked  for a spell, bumbling through the dark, toes and knees knocking into whatever happened to be in their way. Eventually they rounded a bend and came to yet another tunnel, one which gave way to the blinding light of day. It wasn’t far, and when they finally emerged into the sunlight’s warmth, Mandri couldn’t see a thing through the burned in image of day.
Seb’s dagger relented, and Mandri’s aching legs took the opportunity to collapse. Instead of slamming into rock, his knees splashed into warm, soothing sand.
He dug his good hand into it.
It was warm and inviting.
He wanted to wriggle into it like a sand flea.
“Where’s Ayram!?” Seb shouted.
“In the cave,” said a gruff voice. 
“Where in the cave?”
“Inside.”
Seb exclaimed her disdain with a click of her tongue, and she darted back into the dark.
Mandri tried to blink out the bright white blotch of day, but that blotch only faded into a fainter blotch of white. He looked up, and instead of a wide blue sky there was a circle of blue encased in white. A few blinks more, and that whiteness resolved into a circling escarpment of white stone rock. He was sitting at the bottom of a colossal limestone bucket, a pit cave, with walls some fifty feet tall. The prenoon sun angled its light down the sides of the bucket, leaving Mandri’s half of the pit in a dusty, radiant glow, and the other half in a crescent shadow warmed orange from the sand’s reflected light.
There were dark figures milling about in that warm shadow on the opposite side, some standing, some sitting. They were all looking at him.
One of them stepped forward into the sunlight—a dark Zosan girl. Her smooth face was framed by a tight white headscarf, with the unwrapped end hanging loose around the neck. The rest of her figure was shrouded to the ankles by a beige robe. It was a clean and simple look, and despite the wear and tear that spoke of a life roughing it out in the Sand, the woman wore it all with a hint of regal bearing, shoulders held in a kind of self-important swoop that showed she’d been trained in the art of woman-standing-still. 
“You’re the dead boy,” she said. Her voice was as uncompromising as her posture, though she wasn’t much older than Mandri. And while her statement was a simple matter of fact, the way she said it suggested it was some keen insight obvious only to her. 
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. He was anxious to not appear ruffled. He sat back on his heels and contemplated standing up but decided against it because he wasn’t sure if his legs could manage it.
“Don’t speak without permission,” she said as she wrinkled her nose. He supposed she could smell rot on him. “I am Moteah.”
“I’m Mandri.”
“Don’t speak.”
“Sorry.”
Moteah huffed at this final barb, then turned to the scraggly men and women behind her, and said, “Someone get the boy fit for walking. And make sure he doesn’t speak.” Then she walked into caves.
“Get him fit for a dog’s dick,” said a grumbling voice.
“Shut up, Weeg.”
“You shut up.”
“No one’s to mess with the boy until Ayram’s sussed him out.”
The woman who’d come to Mandri’s defense was a silver-haired Jandri poke, athletic, wearing a fitted brown robe with a choking neckline ornamented by knotted leather tassels the length of fingers. This robe, combined with her sun-leathered skin and general greasiness, made her seem like an overgrown taproot come to life. 
“My name’s Forty,” she said. “And you’re Mandri?”
Mandri nodded.
“You can speak,” Forty said, amused. She then turned around and chided the shadows. “I shouldn’t have to say this, but things being what they are—no one touches a hair on this prick’s head unless Ayram says so.”
A few unhappy grunts followed.
“Now, Who’s got Papi’s clothes?”
When no one answered, Forty pointed towards Mandri with an open hand and said, “The boy needs robes before we set out and Papi’s will fit. So, who’s got ‘em?”
“Papi’s not been dead two days,” said one unhappy shadow.
“So? Do you think Papi cares what happens to his clothes?”
“I care.”
“Did you take his clothes, then, Weeg?”
“No.”
“Who did?”
“Tob did.”
Forty turned to a lounging man tucked right inside the bottom swerve of the pit’s crescent shadow. She motioned for Mandri to follow her across the pit and into the shade, and as she sauntered towards this burly fellow he stretched out amongst a couple of burlap sacks, claiming them all with his splayed out arms and legs. Between the man’s beard, brows, and hair there was hardly a splotch of skin on him. There was a mouth on his head somewhere, because sticking out of the beard was a fat, stubby pipe. The smoke swirling out of it stank of freeweed. 
Mandri nodded at this wiry black bush, but it didn’t nod back. Instead it said, “The bastard can freeze and burn for all I care.”
“This is Tob,” said Forty, as she sat down next to the man.
Mandri nodded again.
Tob grunted.
“Tob is an idiot.”
“And Forty’s dried-up,” Tob retorted.
Forty pointed to the bundle of clothes that lay between Tob’s elbow and armpit. “Are those Papi’s clothes?”.
Tob rolled onto his side and patted the bundle with care. “They are. Make a nice pillow, don’t they?”
“Let’s have them.”
“The only way the boy here is getting them is if Ayram commands it.”
“Give them here,” said Forty, undeterred. 
“Woman—what did I just say?”
“You want to explain to Ayram why the boy isn’t ready to walk?”
Tob took a thoughtful drag from his pipe. He held the smoke captive in his barrel chest for a long moment, and the exhale, when it came, was a sheepish attempt to obscure a reluctant, “No.”
Forty pulled the bundle of clothes out from under Tob’s bushy bulk. She tossed it to Mandri as Tob grumbled, “Last I checked we was called the Ayramun, not the Fortyun.”
“Never said we was called anything else.”
Mandri picked at the troublesome knot which kept the outfit wrapped tight, and Tob was clear to stress, “You need be remembering who those clothes belong to. They’re Ayram’s. Everything is Ayram’s here. Clothes on my back. Those clothes there. The food that’s coming to your belly. It’s all loaned out, if you like. Everything’s Ayram’s. Not yours. Not Moteah’s. And not Forty’s either. So don’t get confused by the way the women act.”
Mandri finally pulled the plaited hemp string free, and unrolled the apparel onto the ground. There was a thickish brown, three-layered robe all crumpled up with salt and sweat, and next to it was a simple hoodscarf, brown as well. The dead Papi had no eye for flair, though that suited Mandri just fine. There was also a pair of rawhide boots that, when Mandri put them on, seemed cut perfectly to size. It was all in good shape, too, though the robe was loosely-fit and had a blood stain around the collar and a long splotch of blood running down the left arm as well. In putting it on, Mandri was careful not to stain the right sleeve with his poultice-wrapped wrist, which at this point was leaking a dark, almost black, ooze.
When Mandri finally had it all on, with the tails of the hoodscarf wrapped clumsily around his neck, he felt transformed. He was as pokey as the rest of them.
Tob looked him up and down. “That’s what Papi wore when he got killed.”
“Yeah, I figured.”
“You’re not supposed to speak,” said Tob as he blew a puff of smoke in Mandri’s direction.
“Can I ask why not?”
A gruff voice rose up from the shadows behind. “Cause you a damned Minder, you dent.”
The charge had come from Weeg. Weeg was a dirty and disheveled man who looked like he’d rolled down a dune. Sand was stuck to his unreasonably flat and blocky face. His nose was a bulbous root—must have been broken a time or three.
“Pull off him,” Forty said. “It doesn’t matter if he talks. Not like the Mazid’s out here anyways. And look at him—not like he knows any curses.”
Mandri looked down at his bloodstained sleeve. “If you don’t want me wearing these robes, I don’t need to. I’m fine with just my tunic.”
“Won’t be fine when we head out into the Sand,” said Forty, chuckling. “That skimpy tunic would leave your legs in boils.”
“Hell of a lot wrong with Papi’s robes too,” said Tob. “Them robe’s weave is bad luck—the warp to weft is three to one.”
“Don’t start,” said Forty.
“This ain’t a matter of startin’ and stoppin’. A three to one weave is plain bad luck. That’s how it is.”
Forty groaned and Tob’s caterpillar brow jumped at Mandri. “Women don’t know about luck, do they? Course, you don’t know about it either, do you?”
Mandri shrugged and said, “I feel a little bit lucky. I mean, I’m alive, aren’t I? Couple of fingers ago I thought I was dead.”
“Oh, you weren’t dead,” Tob said emphatically. “You were body dead, sure, but your Spark was still burning.”
“How’s that?”
“Think I know? Don’t ask me about witch business. All I know is when a person gets body-dead but their stomach’s still burns, that only means one thing.” He paused and supped his pipe to savor the anticipation on Mandri’s face.
Forty pooed the man’s slackness and finished the thought. “We found you body-dead in the Junei hills, dressed up as food for the Amalgamete.”
Mandri blanched as Tob puffed out a snot of smoke right at him. “And there’s only one thing the Amalgamete’s stomach do with its food, and that’s make demons.”
“Demons?” Mandri wondered.
Tob’s beady eyes livened up. “That’s right. You woulda been made a demon. Now, you might think that it’s lucky that you didn’t get ate, but look what’s happened, you got found by a witch that reads the future, and that future said, ‘This bastard is gonna have to lose his hand and lose his mind to a Mazid’, and that’s just as bad. Bad, bad luck.”
“Bad luck on him means bad luck on us,” said Weeg, from behind. “I’ll tell you all, Elrahet been readin’ the future upside down. That boy there is a curse. Sun as my light, that boy there is gonna get us all killed.”
“That so?” Tob asked.
“It’s so. I saw that boy fall out of that damned corpsecart we was ambushin’. An’ look what happened—more n’ half of us dead.”
Forty intervened again. “We were dealing with a Mazid and eighty something Skulsi. We were always gonna lose people. This little prick had nothing to do with it.”
Weeg scrunched up his ruined nose, it gave a buckling-crack as the cartilage snapped into a painful sneer. He said, “Woulda been less dead if it weren’t such a shitshow, and you tell me, how’d things go down that way?”
“I’ll tell you,” said Tob.
Forty rolled her eyes and said derisively, “Let me guess—we got unlucky?”
“Damn right. And there’s things you need to know about Luck. Luck is like peelin’ plaster, you have to—”
Forty interrupted with a mule-like whine. “Tob,” she said, “You're the unluckiest bastard in the world. You don’t know shit about luck.” She looked to Mandri through tired eyes and added, “He hides his face in all that hair cause he’s so damned ugly. And guess how he got those scars. The man got his head chewed up by a keenkedra.”
“But I survived!” Tob exclaimed. “Who touched tongues with a full-grown keenki and lived to tell about it? No one! None but me. And why? Because of my luck.”
“You’re lucky you survived, but you were as unlucky as a Hrkan prick to ever get swallowed in the first place.”
“That’s the thing!” Tob exclaimed, almost shouting. His left eye was wide with excitement, revealing to Mandri that under all that hair the right side of his face was paralyzed. Something like that is usually obvious from the way the lips skew when a person speaks, but Tob’s mouth was little more than a hole in the black broom that was his beard, and while that hole did skew, the right side had an excuse for not moving as it was busy clenching his pipe.
“You need some bad luck to really know about luck,” said Tob. “It’s the always-lucky that don’t know a thing about luck because they don’t need to. They don’t step in any holes and they get to believin’ that holes don’t exist. But I’ve stepped in all the holes. I know my way around them by now. I’ve got Luck mapped out as well as anybody who ever lived.”
“That don’t make sense.”
Tob shrugged Forty off and stayed steady on Mandri. “If I shoot an arrow at you, what says whether or not it kills you?”
“Luck?” Mandri asked.
Forty cut in again, saying, “Luck has nothing to do with it. It’s skill.”
“It’s luck!” Tob retorted. “Skill says whether or not you hit the target. You aim at the neck, and if you’re skilled, you hit the neck. Luck says whether it rips through the pipes or only scratches the throat.” As proof of his words, Tob pulled up his beard to reveal, lurking under a scraggle of neck hair, a long white scar that wrapped around his throat.
“Looks like someone tried to chop your head off,” said Mandri.
A shorter, stunted, bald man who’d been snoozing away perked up and shouted, “Chop!?”
All eyes turned to this man, alarmed, and Tob was quick to shout back “No!”, with expressive hands. “No chop. No chop today.” 
“Chop?” the bald man asked again, disappointed.
“No chop,” Tob repeated.
The bald man pouted and lay back down. As soon his head hit his pack of a pillow he was snoozing again.
Tob sighed and said to Mandri, “Don’t say that word around Chopper unless you need something cut. And if you need something cut you better find him and let him do it—or else. Anyways, like I was sayin’, the arrow that did my neck was shot from only twenty paces. Busted right through me. And that arrow came from a Scweeman no less—as skilled as any here with a bow. But he couldn’t beat my luck. I’d wager more than money that my good luck is what saved me.”
“He says that, but he won’t ever actually wager anything,” Forty snipped.
“Because it’s not right for me to take advantage of others in matters of luck.”
“What about a wager on him?” asked the gruff Weeg, pointing a hateful finger at Mandri. “I bet ten wraps this walkin’ curse is gonna get us all killed.”
Forty cracked a wry smile. “If we’re all killed, then how are you gonna come and collect?”
“I bet twenty!” said Weeg.  “Why’d Elrahet make him Minder anyways?”
“I didn’t hear you volunteer.”
“You didn’t either.”
“But I’m not complaining, am I?”
“You should! Makin’ a fresh pulled poke Minder of a Mazid weren’t never part of the plan. Who says he ain’t gonna turn the Mazid on us and roast us all in golden fire?”
“Elrahet says it,” was Forty’s reply, and somehow that was enough to end the argument. Weeg sneered for the sake of it, baring his crooked yellow teeth, but after that he settled down, but not before getting in a final barb. “Can’t trust a fresh pulled poke to keep the piss out their pants.”
Forty rolled her eyes, and Mandri took the opportunity to rest his aching legs by sitting down next to her, for she seemed to be the only person who would tolerate him. 
“Better get used to waiting,” she said. “It’s half of what we do around here.”
Tob overheard and added, “Welcome to the Ayramun.”
From then on, they sat and waited in that crescent shadow in silence. This gave Mandri time to think about how this ragged band of sand-spitting pokes had killed eighty-something Skulsi and captured a Mazid. On top of that, for some god-bothering reason, they’d found Mandri’s body and had brought him back to life just to make him the Mazid’s Minder.
Why?
Only Solraheen knew. Only Solraheen  and some old bat named Elrahet. Since Solraheen was dead, that left Elrahet.
Probably this Ayram knew as well, whoever he was.
Mandri sat and waited for one of them to make an entrance.</Text>

 “You killed it!” Seb exclaimed.
“That was you! ” Hill countered. “Your skinny ass cracked its neck.”
Hill rushed over and picked the broken Mazid up under his arm. “You done it now, Seb. You done it now.”
Seb laughed. “Yeah, like Ayram’s gonna believe you. hopped up and grabbed Mazid’s arm. “I’ll carry it,” she growled.

            <Text>The spitting, scrawny man walking in front of Mandri, the one carrying the ‘unconscious’ Mazidobo, his name was Seb. The man walking behind Mandri, the short and stout man whose bread wasn’t baked all the way through, his name was Hill, and according to Hill, these two names were the only two things that Mandri needed to know. Don’t bother with ‘why’, or ‘what is going on’, or ‘I can’t see where I’m going’, no, the only thing that mattered was that Seb was in front and Hill was behind and that was the way things were going to be.

“Course not,” he protested.
“Why can’t you shit in the hole like everyone else?” Hill challenged.
“I told you, it wasn’t me.”
“It’s always you.”
“It was Choppa’.”
Hill let loose a frustrated sigh. “It’s always you or Chopper, and since this shit is half green, that means it’s you.”
Seb turned a cold shoulder to Hill’s indignation, and started off again into the dark. Hill nudged Mandri to follow.
Seb said, “Don’t play no blame games with me, Hill. Who’s the one pilin’ up all this trash up in here, huh? Ya know there’s a hole for all this, too, but ya’ll too lazy, aren’t ya? Get yourself together afore you come and pick on my habits.” 
Seb wrapped up his complaint with a snort, and he readjusted Obo’s dead weight to accommodate a hefty harrumph. 
Mandri followed along timidly. He searched the flickering ground for a clean edge of stone to scrape his shit-stained foot against. This tunnel was the most loathsome place that he had ever seen. Black moldy growths pickled the ceiling. It was cramped tight with so much stuff and yet not one thing in it was whole. With each step Mandri was becoming more and more convinced that he was back in the good old world because this was life in all its crummy lived-in-ness.
It wasn’t until the trio left this rubbish tunnel and spilled out into a cleaner, roomier tunnel that Mandri was sure—this was an old cave system, not some corridor of Shis. On one side of this tunnel was a store of chopped lumber, and stacked crosswise on the other were plump canvas bags branded with a black Hrkan sunrose compass. Strewn on the floor in between this stolen grain and the firewood was all manner of toe-jamming obstructions—beer pots, sweetgrass baskets, holey-soled and stringless leather boots, a bundle of crude arrows propped up inside a beer pot, more beer pots. Seb picked his way around all this junk as if he’d placed each piece himself, like a pampered toddler waddling through scattered toys, and on his shoulder, slung like a freshly slaughtered sty-pig, was Mazidobo. His unfortunate nose bobbed in and out of Seb’s armpit with every step.
 It was hard to believe anyone could bring a Mazid down so low, and that these two boorish bandits were involved was inconceivable. Seb was as unimposing as an outland poke could be, dirty and hungry looking, with sunken eyes. He looked like desperation itself more than a man, and he wasn’t the dangerous kind of desperation either. He looked like the sad kind of desperation that Mandri could defeat by simply looking away.
Mandri looked behind at Hill. Hill had his plump pinky finger stuck halfway up his own nose, digging for gold.
Mandri grimaced. “Leave some for me,” he said to Hill.
Hill 's eyes flashed, his cheeks flushed, and he gave Mandri a rude but pulled punch in the ribs.
“Get going!” he shouted. Mandri got going. He took two steps, and when that wasn’t hurried enough, Hill shoved him in the back as if that would help. Mandri’s stiff legs couldn’t cope with the sudden shove and he tumbled forward into Seb’s hips. Seb went sprawling, and so did Mazidobo. The three of them tumbled together into the glinting darkness.
“Whore’s breath!” Seb shouted at Hill. “You a pokey old tacko, ain’t ya?!”
Seb pushed himself up to his feet. He glared at Hill intent on brawling.
“Go squeeze your uglies,” Hill groaned as he pushed past Mandri to shine his torch on the Mazid, nearly dropping his when he did, for the Mazid’s bald head was twisted completely the wrong way around. 
“White light!” Hill yelped. “You broke it!”
“I ain’t broke shit!” Seb spat back, his spittle flying out at Hill’s cheek. “You pushed me, you gutswipe!”
Hill growled and picked the broken Mazid up under his arm. “You done it now, Seb. Ayram’s gonna know about this.”
Seb stopped Hill’s leaving by yanking at the Mazid’s arm. “I’ll show it to him.”
Hill glared at Seb with such a murderous eye that Seb dropped the arm without a fuss.
Hill nodded to Mandri and said, “Take the little dent up to the pit.” Then he turned and marched back in the direction from whence they came, taking his torchlight with him. Seb and Mandri were left alone in the dark.
“Shit,” Seb muttered.
 A robe-swish later and Mandri felt the cold iron point of a dagger prodding his back.
“Don’t you think about tryin’ nothin’ stupid,” said Seb.
“I won’t.”
“What’d I say about talkin’? Now get movin’!”
Mandri stood up and he started to move in the direction he supposed Seb’s dagger wanted him to go. The two of them walked like this, bumbling through the pitched-black dark, toes and knees crashing into whatever happened to be in their way. Eventually they rounded a bend and came to yet another tunnel, one which gave way to the blinding light of day. When Mandri stumbled out into the sunlight’s warmth, he couldn’t see a thing.
Seb’s dagger relented, and Mandri’s aching legs took the opportunity to collapse. Instead of slamming into rock, his knees splashed into warm, soothing sand. He dug his hands into it. It was warm and inviting, and he wanted to wriggle into it like a sand flea.
“Where’s Ayram!?” Seb shouted.
“Ayram’s not here,” said a gruff voice. 
“I know he is, where is he?”
“He’s back inside.”
Seb spat his exasperation into the sand, then Mandri felt a brush of air as the man darted back into the cave.
Mandri tried to blink out the burned-in image of day which occluded the world from view, but that blotch of white only faded into a fainter blotch of white. He looked up, and there was a circle of blue sky above, and when he looked back down at the world the whiteness resolved into an encirclement of white stone walls that rose up a good fifty feet. He was sitting at the bottom of a colossal limestone bucket, a pit cave, and the prenoon sun angled it’s light down the sides of this bucket, leaving Mandri’s half of the pit in a dusty, radiant glow, and the other half in a crescent shadow which glowed hot from from all the reflected light.
There were dark figures milling about in that warm shadow on the opposite side, some standing, some sitting. They were all looking at him.
One of them stepped forward into the sunlight—a dark Zosan woman. Her smooth face was framed by a tight white headscarf, with the unwrapped end hanging loose around the neck. The rest of her figure was shrouded to the ankles by a beige robe. It was a clean and simple look, and despite the wear and tear that spoke of a life roughing it out in the Sand, the woman wore it all with a hint of regal bearing, shoulders held in a kind of self-important swoop that showed she’d been trained in the art of woman-standing-still. 
Her voice was as uncompromising as her posture. 
“You’re the dead boy,” she said. 
Yes, Mandri was the dead boy. It was such a simple matter of fact, but the way she said it made it seem like it was some keen insight that was obvious only to her. 
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. He was anxious not to appear ruffled. He sat back on his heels and contemplated standing up but decided against it because he wasn’t sure if his legs could manage it.
“I am Moteah,” said the woman. She wrinkled her nose as she looked down at Mandri. He supposed she could smell death on him.
“That man who brought you out here,” she said.
“Seb?”
“Yes, Seb. Do you know why he was in a hurry?”
“Uh, well…I think it has something to do with the Mazid.”
The word was hardly out of Mandri’s mouth when three scraggly men, all wrapped up in deep desert fashion, leapt to their feet and sprinted across the sand towards Mandri. In five strides they brushed right past him, and on the sixth they disappeared into the dark tunnel.
Moteah turned to others gathered, and said, “Someone get the boy fit for walking.” Then she ran into caves.
“Get him fit for a dog’s dick,” said a grumbling voice.
“Oh, shut up Spiddy.”
“You shut up.”
“No one’s to mess with the boy until Ayram’s sussed him out.”
The woman who’d come to Mandri’s defense was a silver-haired, athletic woman whose brown robe was fitted with several knotted leather leather tassels. This combined with her sun-leathered skin made her seem like an overgrown taproot come to life. 
“My name’s Forty,” she said.
“I’m Mandri.”
“Yeah, whatever.”
Forty turned back to the shadows and puffed herself. “I shouldn’t have to say this, but things being what they are—no one touches a hair on this prick’s head unless Ayram says so.”
She nodded towards Mandri. A few unhappy grunts followed.
“Now,” Forty said, continuing to address the shadows, “Who’s got Papi’s clothes?”
When no one answered, Forty pointed towards Mandri with an open hand and said, “The boy needs robes before we set out and Papi’s will fit. So, who’s got ‘em?”
“Come on, Forty—Papi’s not been dead two days.”
“So? Do you think he cares what happens to his clothes?”
“I care.”
“Did you take his clothes, then, Kimp?”
“No. Tob did.”
Forty turned to a lounging shadow tucked right inside the bottom swerve of the pit’s crescent shadow. She motioned for Mandri to follow her into the shade and so he did.
 In that shadow’s edge was a burly man stretched out amongst a couple burlap sacks. This man’s head was a wiry bush of black, for between the beard, brows, and hair there was hardly a splotch of skin. There was a mouth in there somewhere, because sticking out of the beard was a smoking pipe of freeweed. 
This man, Tob, was propped up on one elbow. He took one look at Mandri and said, “The bastard can freeze and burn for all I care.”
Forty sauntered over to the limestone wall and sat down next to this surly bush of a man.
“This is Tob,” she said.
Mandri nodded.
Tob grunted.
“Tob is an idiot,” Forty said.
“Oh, come off it,” Tob moaned.
“Are those Papi’s clothes?” she asked as she pointed to the bundle of clothes that lay between Tob’s elbow and armpit.
Tob patted the bundle with care and said. “They are. Make a nice pillow, don’t they?”
“Let’s have them.”
“The only way the boy here is gettin’ them is if Ayram commands it.”
“Give them here,” said Forty, undeterred. 
“Woman. What did I just say?”
“You want to explain to Ayram why the boy isn’t ready to go when he gets out here?”
Tob took a long, thoughtful drag from his pipe, let the smoke swirl around with his thoughts, then finally relented.
“Alright.”
The man pulled the bundle of clothes out from under his bushy bulk, and made to undo the string that wrapped it all together, grumbling as he did it. “You know, last I checked we was called the Ayramun, not the Fortyun.”
“Never said we was.”
Tob gave up trying to undo a troublesome knot, and he tossed the wrapped bundle of clothes at Mandri’s feet. “Go on,” he said. “But you need be remembering who those clothes belong to.”
“I’ve heard,” said Mandri. “They’re Papi’s.”
“No.” Tob scowled. “They’re Ayram’s. Everything is Ayram’s here. Clothes on my back. Those clothes there at your feet. The food that’s coming to your belly. It’s all loaned out, if you like. Everything’s Ayram’s, not yours, not Moteah’s, and not Forty’s either. So don’t get confused by the way this woman acts.”
Mandri picked up the bundle. He pulled at the plaited hemp string and unrolled the clothes onto the ground. There was a thin, brown, loose-fitting robe that was crumpled with salt and sweat, and a hood-scarf, brown, with a diamond pattern of beige sewn down the sides. There was also a pair of rawhide boots that, when he put them on, seemed cut perfectly to size. It was all in good shape, too, though the robe had a blood stain around the collar, and there was a splotch of blood running along the length of the left arm and a thin stream of it running all the way down the left side.
When Mandri finally had it all on, Tob looked him up and down with a peculiar stare and said, “That’s what Papi wore when he got killed.”
“Yeah, I figured.”
Tob blew a puff of smoke in Mandri’s direction.
Mandri said, “I take it you’re not comfortable with me wearing this?”
“Like the woman said, Papi’s dead. He don’t want em.”
Mandri could feel the rest of the Ayramun glaring at him.
“I don’t know,” said Mandri, “It seems a bit rude to be wearing these.”
“Ain’t it, though?” said a voice in the shadows behind.
“Oh screw off,” said Forty. “It doesn’t matter.”
Mandri looked down at the bloodstained sleeve. “Really, I’m fine with just my tunic,” he said.
“Won’t be fine when we head out into the Sand,” said Forty. “That tunic would leave your legs in sunboils.”
“Hell of a lot wrong with Papi’s robes too,” Tob said. “Those clothes have got bad luck knitted through every stitch.”
“Don’t start,” said Forty.
“This ain’t a matter of startin’ and stoppin’. Those clothes are plain bad luck. That’s how it is.”
Forty groaned and Tob’s caterpillar brow winked at Mandri. He said, “Women don’t know about luck, do they?”
“I don’t either,” Mandri replied. “Because I don’t have any luck.”
“Oh, that’s a lie,” Tob scoffed. “You gotta be the luckiest prick this side of Shis.”
“Well, I don’t know about that.&quot;
“Boy, you been about to be turned into a demon, and you standin’ here breathin’, and you don’t think you’re lucky?”
“Turned into a demon?” Mandri asked.
Forty answered, “We found you half-dead in the Junei hills, dressed up as food for the Amalgamete.”
Tob supped his pipe and added, “There’s only one thing the Amalgamete’s stomach do with its food, and that’s make demons. And how’d you get caught up like that anyway?”
A large brutish man, larger than Tob and with a face that looked like it’d been broken in half said, “I’ll tell you what how. That boy there is cursed. Sun as my light, that boy there is gonna get us all killed.”
“That so?” Tob asked.
“Seb found him in that damn corpsecart we was ambushin’. An look what happened—more n’ half of us dead.”
Forty intervened yet again. “We were dealing with a god damned Mazid,” she said. “And eighty something Skulsi. We were always gonna lose people. This little shit had nothing to do with it.”
“We woulda lost less if it weren’t such a shitshow, and you tell me, how’d things go down that way?”
“I’ll tell you,” said Tob.
Forty rolled her eyes and said derisively, “Let me guess—we got unlucky?”
“Damn right.”
Near Tob’s belly was a leather pack and he reached down into it and pulled out a bright brown pouch the size of his fist. He loosened the string that kept it closed and revealed to Mandri an assortment of rocks and pebbles inside. “Take one of my rocks.”
“Don’t,” said Forty.
“These are lucky rocks,” said Tob, ignoring her. “Count yourself blessed. They be small measures of luck, but they do in a pinch—not that a lucky prick like you needs them.”
“How do you know they’re lucky rocks?” Mandri asked as he looked over the stones, pretending to be impressed. 
“They’ve been tested,” Tob said. “You pick a rock up, try to do somethin’ with it, then see what happens. If it works, good chance is the thing is lucky. If it works ten times over, then its been tested.”
“I see.”
“I keep the unlucky rocks, too,” Tob continued. “They’re not as good as a curse pot, but if someone gets to pesterin’ you, slip one of these bad boys into their pocket.” Tob then took another pouch from out of his things, and opened it to reveal another bunch of rocks. Each of these had a white ‘X’ scratched into them. Tob picked one of them up and smiled at Forty while he thumbed its grooves.
“Little stones of retribution. Ever find one of these babies in your shoe, Forty?”
Forty shrugged.
Mandri asked Tob, “If a rock is lucky, how does that make me lucky?”
“Don’t get him started,” Forty said, but the question had hooked Tob with ease. The man folded his hands over his big belly, and said “Luck is like peelin’ plaster—”
Forty interrupted with a mule-like whine and said, “Tob, you're the unluckiest bastard in the world.” She looked to Mandri and added, “He hides his face in all that hair cause he’s so damned ugly. And guess how he got those scars.”
Mandri shrugged.
“The man got his head chewed up by a keenkedra.”
“But I survived!” Tob exclaimed. “Who has touched tongues with a full-grown keenki and lived to tell about it? No one! None but me. And why? ‘Cause of my stones.”
“You’re lucky you survived, but you were unlucky as uglies to ever get swallowed in the first place.”
“That’s the thing, though!” Tob exclaimed, his left eye wide with excitement, revealing to Mandri that under all that hair, the right side of his face was paralyzed. Something like that is usually obvious from the way the lips skew when a person speaks, but Tob’s mouth was little more than a hole in that brush of a beard, and while that hole did skew, the right side had an excuse for not moving as it was busy supping on his pipe.
“You need some bad luck to really know about luck,” said Tob. “It’s the always-lucky that don’t know a thing about luck because they don’t need to. They don’t step in any holes and they get to believin’ that holes don’t exist. But I’ve stepped in all the holes. I know my way around them by now. I’ve got Luck mapped out as well as anybody who ever lived.”
“That does make sense,” said Mandri.
“No it doesn’t,” said Forty.
Tob brushed her off and said to Mandri, “If I shoot an arrow at you, what says whether or not it kills you?”.
“Luck?”
Forty cut in again and said, “Luck has nothing to do with it. It’s skill.”
“It’s luck!” Tob retorted. “Skill says whether or not you hit the target. You aim at the neck, and if you’re skilled, you hit the neck. Luck says whether it rips through the pipes or only scratches the throat.” As proof of his words, Tob brushed up his beard reveal, lurking under a scraggle of neck hair, a long white scar that wrapped around his throat.
“Looks like someone tried to chop your head off,” said Mandri.
Right after Mandri said this, a shorter, stunted bald man who’d been snoozing away perked up and shouted, “Chop!?”
“No!” said Tob with expressive hands. “No chop. No chop today.” 
“Chop?” the bald man asked again.
“No chop.”
The bald man pouted and lay back down. As soon his head hit his packy pillow he was snoozing again.
Tob turned to Mandri and said, “Don’t say that word around Chopper unless you need something chopped. And if you need something chopped you better find him and let him do it—or else. Anyways, like I was sayin’, the arrow that did my neck was shot from only twenty paces. Busted right through me. And that arrow came from a Scweeman no less—as skilled as any here with a bow. But he couldn’t beat my luck, and half my luck is these stones. I’d wager more than money that my stones is what saved me. ‘Cause Forty is right, my natural luck is shit. It’s only cause of these stones that I’m here talking to you now.”
With that said, everyone settled down, and Mandri sat down next to Forty because she seemed to be the only person who would tolerate him. 
“Better get used to waiting,” she said. “It’s half of what we do around here.”
“And who is we?”
“We’re the Ayramun. Well, you aren’t. You can if you want to be.”
Tob overheard and said, “That’s not up to him.”
“Yeah, whatever,” said Forty.
From then on no one spoke. They all sat and waited in that crescent shadow. Mandri was thankful for the quiet. It gave him time to think about how in Solraheen’s name these people—these people—had killed eighty-something Skulsi and captured a Mazid. On top of that, they’d brought his own Spark back into his body. There was something strange happening here, and for the first time ever, he came to admit that somebody else must have a better idea of what was going on. The only thing he knew for certain was that someone wasn’t sitting on their haunches here in this hell hole. Perhaps it was Ayram.
So Mandri sat and waited for this great man to make his entrance.</Text>

            <Text>Ayram led them to southeast leading Charnel road called the Hatthir road. There were plenty of pilgrim skeletons on the Hatthir road. One of them, it turned out, was still alive. Ayram noticed the man first. He picked up the poor pilgrim and set him the shade of a makeshift tent. The dying pilgrim stared out at all the Ayramun with winkless eyes. His skin was like paper, and his ribs were countable through the window in his yellow haircloth habit, while his stomach lay almost flat against his vertebral column.
This pilgrim thought Ayram was Solraheen enfleshed. Ayram paused, sponged water onto the man’s lips, and they made a brief, whispered exchange which Mandri could not hear.
Mandri gave the pilgrim one of Tob’s rocks. It put a passing joy into the pilgrim’s eyes. Then the Ayramun moved on to let him die.</Text>

            <Title>Spark</Title>
            <Text>Death is a terrifying thing, but Life is more so. Life kills. Life kills, and it eats what it kills, and for some reason, people fear death. As any well-studied Solitant student can see, do not fear death, fear life! 
There is a tribe in the Baree lowlands, the Ferzamun, who will not take shade under tree or bush because they believe that bark-fleshed leafy beings survive in the desert by poisoning the air to kill whatever sits underneath. A man falls asleep in that shade, he dies, and his body’s water will sustain the plant for years. His bones, once buried, will fertilize the soil for the next generation.
Living things kill. Living things kill and eat each other. It is believed, by those who seek out demons, that this self-perpetuating cycle is motivated by the Spark’s desire to be reunite with itself.
Elrahet was no Solitant, and yet she prayed the Solitant’s prayer as she sliced open Ayram’s wrist and sipped his flesh.

Consumed by the body
	So that it can
Feed the Spark
	So that it can
Move the flesh
	So that it can be
Consumed by the body

She spoke the words in Old Jandri, and though that guttural speech was strange to Mandri’s ears, he knew them by their cadence. She did not invite anyone else to partake. 
When she was finished, she closed Ayram’s eyes, and that was truly the end of him. And with him gone, so too went any hope of a crowning future.
“What do we do?” Purl asked. Her face was drawn and her hair, frazzled and streaked in hag beetle blood.
“We keep going,” said Moteah. She’d made it through the battle without a scratch and yet . Try to salvage the situation against sense. She said, “For Ayram’s sake we keep going. For everyone’s sake. For Solraheen’s sake, we keep going.”
“Go where?” Moto said through clenched teeth and frustrated tears. “Ayram’s dead. Dumb-ass Seb got the Riga’s head split open, so unless Elrahet can pull the Mazid’s Spark out of a spoiled corpse, then we’d have to start over from scratch!”
Mandri recalled the sight of the hag beetle’s spike impaling both Seb and the Riga. The pair were still lying there in a gruesome heap. Could Elrahet still draw the pseudo-Spark from the Riga’s mouth if it had a hag beetle’s spike riping through it? All desperate eyes turned to the witch, but her solemn face could not hide the truth—the Riga was indeed spoiled. Their long mission was at an end.
“We have nothing,” said Moto. “And this is over.” He took a moment to gather his wits and to wipe his cheek of weakness, then he picked up his sword from where he’d dropped it. He pointed that blade towards the unconscious Amalgamete down the hall, who still impressed terror in the light of the two blazing braziers.
“I’m going to carve up that beast,” said Moto, “And then I’m leaving. If anyone wants to follow, they can. But I’m not Ayram. There is no ‘me and mine’.”
When Moteah did not follow, he paused and beckoned to his sister. 
“Come,” he said. “We’re leaving.”
Moteah was still in shock. “This can’t be it,” she said. “This is all supposed to mean something. This can’t be the end.”
She reached out towards Ayram and brushed his shoulder. A sob welled up in her throat and she stifled it down with a fluttering breath. Then she stood up and followed her brother, leaving Mandri, Purl, and Elrahet behind.
“It’s all my fault,” said a glassy-eyed Purl, her voice unfeeling, her features numbed by exhaustion. 
Elrahet said nothing as Purl stood up silently and followed after Moto. It was Mandri that her bony finger pointed out.
“Grab the legless Mazid,” she said. “And Purl! Fetch my needle and string.”
She picked up her walking stick hand pushed past Mandri, pushed past Moto, heading towards the Amalgamete.
“Hurry up!” she yelled. Her tone brooked no argument.
Mandri ran over to the dark corner of the hall, where he’d shed his pack. Obo was still squished inside. He pulled up on the stubby ar ms and Obo slid out, pale as ever, limp, naked and legless. He had an inkling of what was happening here.
He hauled Obo’s body down the hall to where the others stood waiting. The flaming braziers cast their shadows against that horrifying cake of flesh that was the Amalgamete, and sprouting out above them was the green-robed figure of the old king Greskal. He was still unconscious, and he snored loudly through a phlegm-choked throat.
Elrahet said to Moto “Cut him open. Right here.” She pointed towards the center of the Amalgamete’s stomach with her stick and drew a line
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Moto asked.
He regretted his words as soon as he said them for he’d drawn the witch’s gaze. He’d thought her eyes were merely brown, but they were flecked with gold, and her twisted brow set them into a feral glare which filled him with a sense of being uncovered, caught out, and that his next move would be his last. Nothing he could do could ever surprise her.
Thankfully Moto drew her away when he said, “If that Mazid is given a Spark, it could kill us all.”
“Thank you Moto,” said Elrahet sarcastically. “I hadn’t considered that. Now cut the demon open.”
Moto stepped forth and stabbed. His face was full of anger. He twisted the blade before he pulled his slice, and as he did, the tension in that great canvas of flesh snapped and a black pool of viscera poured out. Up above, Greskal let loose a horrid whine, though he stayed fixed in his nightmare sleep.
“Bring me the Mazid,” said Elrahet.
Mandri brought Obo forth.
Elrahet studied the Amalgamete’s fluids as they pooled and advanced along the grouted grooves in the floor. Black chunks of half-digested , and these she studied carefully as if looking for some particular fleck of meat. She said, “I will do a thing which has not been done for as long as I can remember.” Her eyes flicked to Obo’s corpse. “I am going to give a thing a Spark.”
She yanked Obo from Mandri’s grip then stepped onto the lowest flap of fat as if it were a stair. She lifted the heavy flap of skin which hung over the Amalgamete’s gaping stomach. She stuffed the Mazid inside. Purl then handed over the bone needle and wicked flax thread, and with these Elrahet proceeded to sew the skin back together. Her needlework was crude, and the uneven sutures did little to keep the wound together, but this didn’t bother her. The thread was, it seemed, merely a step in a ritual.
When she’d finished with the needle and thread she tossed them aside, then said, “Back away,” as if any of them needed any urging. 
She then put her hand on the wound and began to pray.
She spoke in an unfamiliar tongue, and her voice cracked and rumbled, lending her words the authority of her age. The more she spoke the quicker her cadence rolled and at the start of the third repeat a gust of wind burst into the hall as if some unseen door had opened above them. This wind was a cold, mountain wind, and it brushed the flames in the two braziers into swirling spires that sparkled white.
This sudden brightness startled Greskal out of his sleep. He looked down and saw what was being done to him, and he let loose a pleading shriek. This discordant note startled Elrahet out of her reverie, and she stumbled back. But her spell was not broken, for whatever door she had opened could not now be closed. The Amalgamete’s stomach seemed to boil and roil inside, and his whole belly shook, ballooned, and finally the sutures were ripped open in a sudden burst, and a black spurt of blood and bile spraying throughout the room.
Mandri shielded his face with his arm. When he looked up again, the old king Greskal lay limp against his bulk and he wind was gone. Lying on the floor, spilled out in that dark amniotic fluid, was Obo, pale skin peeking through that slathered in black.
He was moving.
“Sol’s light,” Obo muttered as he discovered, again, the world. Though he looked like he’d just been spat out the mouth of Shis, he was remarkably calm. He set his bright eyes searching about the room, and they settled on Ayram, dead on the floor near the entrance to the hall.
He looked down at the sludge that slimed his nubby arms. 
He looked behind at the Amalgamete.
Elrahet said, “Sparked flesh is warmer.”
Obo’s eyes went wide. 
“You didn’t,” he said.
“I did.”
Obo with a Spark was his same old unflappable self. He did not scream excitement or cry a tear of glory, he merely observed the new sensations pulsing through his arms and muttered, “Interesting.”
Elrahet stepped forward, foot sliding in the muck, and she said, “About our deal—in exchange for a Spark, you will save Solraheen.”
Obo tried to wipe the muck from his hip, but this only smeared it around.
“Fetch a rag,” said Elrahet out the corner of her mouth. Moto already had one ready and tossed it to Obo. With no hands to catch it, the body-length rag landed on Obo’s head like a shroud.
“Our deal,” Elrahet said. “I give you a Spark, so now you’ll help us free Solraheen.”

Moto was standing off to Obo’s right, frowning deeply, as if the smell was driving him insane—and indeed, it might have been, for that bile was as bad as the rot of death. But what upset Moto ran deeper than foul smell. His, and his hand fussed at the hilt of his sword. 
“You grip your sword too tightly,” said Obo. “It makes me nervous.” And in case his meaning wasn’t clear, he turned his bald head towards Moto, and as he did the pallid skin of his throat flushed gold, and his breath was a spout of flames licking his lips. That was enough send Moto bumbling backwards.
“You lied,” Moto seethed.
“Shouldn’t you be running away?”
“If you’re going to kill us, then kill us!”
Furtive smile. He began again to wipe himself down with the rag as if he’d just come out of a bath, reaching under his arms and around his emaciated side. “I am but one of the Mazidai. The rest of my kind is still in chains, and that is not acceptable to me. So you, Elrahet, your knowledge of the Spark is the most precious thing to me in all the world. I’ll still trade for it.”
“We’ve already made a deal.”
“Your quest is not possible. I’m not going to go and lose my Spark right after I’ve gained it.”
“Sneer?” said Moto.
“Moto,” said Obo, “If you value your life then you’ll treat me with a measure of respect.”
The charge flustered Moto, and when Elrahet didn’t speak up for him, the swashbuckling Zosan shied away.
Elrahet rapped her walking stick on the stone floor and countered, “Would you do it to save your own Spark, then?”
“Are you threatening to take it back?”
he could erase her head if she so much as breathed a witchy word.
“This world turns on a knife’s edge,” Elrahet replied. “If it falls one way instead of the other, then every Spark—yours and mine—will be snuffed out.”
That he was listening.
Elrahet sighed the sigh of an old woman who was tired of having to play with her own thoughts to make them palatable to others. “What do you know about how the world was made?” she asked.
Obo blinked and said, “Nothing.”
With that, she turned away from Obo and began to walk away as if she’d lost all interest.
“Come!” said Elrahet as her cane clicked on the tiles. “Let me show you why you must help. Come!”
“Where are we going?”
“To find a hole in the earth.”

Elrahet did not have to look long for a hole of the type that she was seeking—there was one in the cluttered study that lay adjacent to the throne room—Greskal’s study. A  shield-sized chunk of the floor was missing from its center, and a torn green carpet hung down into the depths. A large upturned table lay canted on the far side of the room, and from this, as well as a scattering of books, Mandri judged that the hole had, somehow, burst up from below. Moto dropped a torch into it, revealing a red rock floor some few meters away.
“Where does that lead?” Mandri asked.
“Where do you think?” said Elrahet.
 Of course, there was only one possible answer—it led to the depths of Shis.

            <Title>White Tails</Title>
            <Text>One morning they came across a herd of white-tails one-thousand strong. More commonly known as poop-tails. Mandri asked Obo why they shat on their tails, because Obo had an answer for everything. Obo said that when it gets too hot—and it always gets too hot—poop-tail lizards cup their webbed hind feet and then evacuate their cloacal contents onto them, allowing them to rub their tails in it, and they do this so that when they raise their tails into the air and open them up like sails, the liquid from their piss-shit gets sucked up by the sun, and in so doing, it draws the heat from the body.
Seb overheard this explanation and said, “That’s just like garglin’ urine to wet the throat.”
Mandri didn’t even cringe at the thought. When the heat dries out the throat it gets scratchy.
This time spent in this wilderness was acquainting him well with his body’s functions, because the body is all there was out there. Nothing about it was disgusting. Mandri worried that if found Seb’s behavior to be tolerable, he himself must look outlandish. Yes, he was turning into a regular outland poke. Sol knows he slathered enough kell oil on to look the part.</Text>

            <Title>Natron Flat</Title>
            <Text>After the well, they came to a natron flat two miles long and as many wide. Seb broke off small chunks of the white stuff and rubbed it on his few remaining teeth. He said it had medicinal properties. Mandri knew it for its use in pigments. A tiny amount mixed in with quartz sand and copper ore made a blue called Campor Blue, called as such because the most vibrant hues came from Campor, where more than a hundred slaves spent their days sorting the quartz sand for impurities grain by grain with tweezers. Only the cleanest, purest grains of crystal were worthy.
Purl found this fact distasteful instead of impressive. Mandri was quick to agree. Obo didn’t much care.
They crossed the flat without incident.</Text>

            <Title>Pile Of Dead</Title>
            <Text>A long year ago, Mandrameen decided to quit painting. In the weeks leading up to that moment, he’d laze the days away in the hall of a governor named Eruhd. Mandri drank the governor’s wine, stuffed his face with peach chicken potstickers and pickled lizard pluck, all the while admiring the paintings of the Lady Frumule.
Mandri liked Frumule’s work. She had no equal—surpassed by some, yes, but no true equal. She was decent. She was a painter’s painter, and that meant that the subtleties of her brush were completely lost on the Hrkan elite, and her tremendous talent went largely overlooked. Mandri saw in her a kindred spirit, and he was inspired by almost everything she did and that included how she died—she killed herself by jumping from a balcony that overlooked the sea.
Mandri had scribbled a few charcoal compositions of that moment, the moment just before the jump, the lady standing on a white stone banister with waist-length hair wind-blown against her figure, hugging her, when nobody else would. Strangely, Mandri could never find someone to put up the funds for the finished piece.
On one of those lazy days spent idling around in the governor’s halls, Mandri saw a rare sight—one of the twelve Hrkan Lords was admiring Frumule’s paintings. The old man stopped to contemplate each piece, an especially curious sight because this Lord was the Lord Gagan, a rough and tumble fellow who’d clearly risen up from the grumble of the Skulsi, a battle hardened fanatic who looked more likely to chew on the canvas than admire its deft use of color. He wasn’t the usual foppish wimp that makes a show of art appreciation. And Lord Gagan struck his most thoughtful pose before Frumule’s greatest work, a painting titled, “The Shadow of the Goriol Valley”.
Mandri’s opinion of the painting was that it was a work of meager genius, and only meager genius because Mandri could not admit anyone as a true genius. The painting was good. It was a view from the low Goriol Valley trail, looking up at the ridge line which sheltered the valley from the eastern winds. The sun was setting behind that ridge, so most of the scene was covered in shadow—blues, purples and muddy grays that seemed almost red when nestled against those cooler hues. Near the bottom, in the middle distance, was a sinuous, slow flowing creek. Its water was truly red. That’s the first thing the viewer sees as one walks towards the painting from afar, for not only is the creek spotlighted by the sun peeking over the ridge, but the composition is structured in such a way that the eye is drawn to a stepping-stone waterfall that’s set on a golden third. Below this waterfall, bobbing in its pool, is a brown lump of something strange. Step a little closer to the painting and it becomes clear that this lump is a face-down, lifeless body. The water isn’t merely red, stained as such by clay or vegetable matter, it is blood red, for the shadowed valley slope above is carpeted in human corpses.
One almost has to squint to see the bodies, but they are there, soldiers all, brown bodies folded and crumpled on top of each other like a storm from the Abari highlands had ripped through the valley and dumped them there. 
Lord Gagan said, “I think this is the worst painting ever made.” 
No doubt the Lord had seen a mound of bodies before. Probably, he’d ordered them made. Perhaps the Lord was suggesting that Frumule should have painted fruit and flowers instead, because a sheltered woman could not possibly capture the greater meaning that a well bloated body presented when it was piled on top of twenty others. Mandri couldn’t say for sure as he had never seen a pile of the battle dead. He always assumed that he never would. He would never know if the Lord’s chiding remark had merit. Then the battle of Minting Rock happened and a good seventy something Hrkans died, and half the Ayramun as well. When the fighting was finished, Ayram directed whoever was left to gather up the dead, Hrk and Outland alike, and put them into a pile. 
They were to be piled into the shape of a sphere. Mandri was not told why it should be a sphere instead of a regular old pile, and as a pile of bodies does not naturally take a sphere’s shape, Mandri was conscripted to construct a large bowl out of Minting Rock’s rubble. Mandri spent the afternoon building that giant bowl, and he did a terrible job on account of the hobble in his leg, his missing hand, and his general desire to be useless. When the bodies were eventually tossed into this leaky bowl they made a regular old lump—not a sphere. 
No one seemed to care. An effort had been made and an effort was enough. Mandri supposed everyone was too exhausted to be upset with poor workmanship. And they were handling their own dead friends, so the mood was dour. There were also those desiccated giants, the ones that had been tucked away inside of Minting Rock’s tombs for who knows how many centuries. In the collapse they’d split apart like twigs and whatever was found of them was tossed on top of the pile like kindling.
By twilight the grim deed was finished, the dead were together. Mandri was allowed to creep away and rest against a heap of rocks, and there he sat, alone, munching on some Hrkan hardtack he’d gathered from a dead man’s robe. His thoughts turned to that painting of the Goriol Valley and the Lord Gagan’s chiding critique.
This pile of dead did not resemble what Frumule had painted. There was significantly more blood in Frumule’s vision, and Frumule’s dead bodies were more seductive, though that was just how people were painted, living or dead. Her bodies were well-muscled and well-naked, or half-naked, and they looked like they’d just stepped out of a bath instead of choking each-other in the sand. It was a typical dramatic device—the perfection of youth cut down before their time—but Frumule’s message went further than that, for Frumule came from a school of artists who thought they had important things to say. She wanted to make people aware, as if they weren’t already, of mankind’s abiding concupiscence.
Her subject was war, her project was the perversion of lust and desire. Frumule’s battlefield lay strewn with naked men lying upon naked men. They’d all come down from their passionate trance, where reason gave way to baser instinct, where they wrestled, where their limbs tangled and their weapons, phallic, penetrating, stabbed into slits that bled. It was all quite pointed and homoerotic, with eyes rolled back, jaws slack, because ecstasy and death often looked the same and so did battle and sex—if one side isn’t satisfied, perhaps they go at it again until everyone is utterly spent.
Mandri surveyed the rubble of Minting Rock, as well as his own memory of what had transpired, and there wasn’t a lick of sexual energy in any of it. There’d been excitement, yes, but that did not last long. Whatever relief there was at the end had been firmly put to bed as soon as the bodies of the dead were tallied.
Forty’s body could not be found, and that set the mood of the Ayramun careening into a fog of gloom. She had been well-liked. Seb had seen her jump into the fray, before the collapse, and that meant she was entombed in the bottom of Minting Rock’s central well.
Chopper’s death was unnecessary. He’d lived through the collapse, but in a fit of chop-lust he sprinted towards a Hrkan soldier and was walloped by Ayram’s spear. Ayram was not forthcoming about precisely how it occurred, as all he said was, “The idiot got in the way”. But Chopper’s body told the story—his ribs were shattered, and his lips were stained by his own blood. He’d died choking on it.
Bush-headed Tob had been unlucky. He’d survived the first half of Minting Rock splitting off, but from the way Moto told it, the second half’s collapse sent a leg-sized shard of stone whistling down in Tob’s direction. If Tob had been standing a step to either side, he would have survived.
The old witch Elrahet survived, as old witches always do. She was busy mumbling witchy incantations as she laid her hands on the pile of dead. Moteah was beside her, managing a meager flame that illuminated nothing as she tried, pitifully, to shield it from the wind. The rest of the surviving Ayramun—Ayram, Seb, and Moto—kept themselves busy trying to salvage what they could from the destruction. They’d already looted the dead for anything useful, mostly foodstuffs, as the Hrks had brought plenty of hardtack wrapped neatly in crinkly brown-leaf squares, each stamped with the sunrose sigil of Hrk.
“It’s all bullshit,” Mandri muttered.
He was referring, of course, to everything—his leg, his skin sticky from sweat, Frumule’s attempt to impress the world, and the Ayramun, too, because all their friends had just been slaughtered and they were already moving on. They were glum, sure, but it didn’t feel like that was enough. Not a watery eye in sight when someone should be wailing. Poor Chopper. Poor Tob.
And Obo was gone.
Unfortunate.
Mandri had lost his hand for nothing.
He thought about humming a song for Obo. Obo wasn’t human and never had a Spark, but he was deserving of a song, and if not a song, at least something more than mere remembrance.
Mandri groaned against the thought that he shouldn’t even be here. He should be back in Meskalim, laying in his field getting high on burgeons.
High as the uglies on a too-tall horse.
Folks in Eez call it tickleberried.
All he had to show for his many travails were the wounds.
Seb had been idling nearby like a dried out lizard. She said, “You look mad to be alive.”
Mandri snorted and said, “Unfortunately it seems I’m too lucky to die.”
“Lucky?”
“I’ve cheated death about five times in the past four days, so I’m starting to think that luck is real.”
Seb chuckled, though that did nothing to lighten the mood because she was so grimy. A fat black borcandi spine poked out between her rubbed-down teeth. 
“No such thing as cheatin’ death,” she said. She spat a wad of goo into the sand. “If there was, then everyone been cheatin’ death every moment of their lives. Shit, since you been sittin’ there you breathed ‘bout a hundred times—that’s a hundred deaths you just put off, but I don’t see you thankin’ luck for the miracle.”
“Breathing is not a miracle.”
“Tell that to folks that can’t breathe. Friend of mine once died when she was sleepin’. Wasp flew straight in her open mouth and stung her in the dangly bit. Thing swole up the size of a pigs uglies.”
“Sounds horrible.”
“An’ it could happen to you. Could happen any given moment, but I don’t see you prostratin’ yourself every second, thankin’ luck for keepin’ the damn wasps from uggin’ up your throat.”
“Well, in case it’s necessary, I will give thanks.” Mandri opened his arms to the reddening sun and said, “I thank you, Luck, for keeping the wasps away!”
Seb snorted and smirked. She appreciated the sarcasm.
“No one’s special,” she said. “Everybody is who they is, an’ that’s all they is.”
“I don’t disagree.”
“Wouldn’t matter if you did. The gods are playin’ a game an’ that’s all there is to it. An’ you best believe me—‘cause you might catch sight of the hand of Solraheen, and you best be ready or else you get slapped.”
“Right,” said Mandri, flippantly.
“Don’t ‘right’ at me,” Seb said, offended.
“Sorry. It’s just the last time I heard someone talk about Solraheen’s hand, it was a priest getting his head chopped off.”
“What’s a priest losing his head got to do with it?”
“He was arrested for stealing the legs of the Lybion martyrs from the temple of Jeetz.”
A look of disbelief on Seb’s weathered face. She said, “Them legs are as watched as the sun.”
“That’s why they caught him and put him on trial. And you know what he said in his defense? He said the hand of Solraheen directed him. He said if Solraheen didn’t want him to have such sacred relics, then Solraheen wouldn’t have allowed the theft to occur in the first place.”
“And he were right.”
“The judge said that if Solraheen wanted that priest to keep his head, Solraheen wouldn’t have allowed the man to be caught.”
Seb nodded without appreciating the irony. “That’s how it is.”
They both sat there, staring at the mound of bodies, Seb in wistful repose, and Mandri leaning away, wondering if the odor pricking his nose was coming from Seb, or himself, or the bodies. The woman was still as dirty as when that Hrkan soldier had pulled her out of the sand. She was as comfortable in that cake of dirt as any burrowing lizard.
Eventually, Seb stood up and said, “Come on.” She brushed off her ass, as if that would wipe away the absolute filth that covered her. “I been lookin’ for the Mazid’s body all day, an’ now that you're free, you’re gonna help me find it.”
“Why?”
“Because that’s what Ayram told me to do, an’ now that’s what I’m tellin’ you to do. Let’s test your luck, maybe you find him afore me.”
Seb and Mandri spent the next hand and a half searching for Obo's body. They had no luck until Mandri got tired of looking and decided to apply himself. He realized that if he’d been thrown clear of the destruction, then Obo probably had as well. From there they checked around where Mandri landed, and sure enough, there was Obo, still swaddled in black, poking out of the sand like a black grub. Seb didn’t want to touch Obo, so Mandri pulled him out alone, though this didn’t require much effort. Mandri found himself hoping that he’d feel Obo wiggle back to life once shaken, but no, he was as lifeless as the rest of the dead, though nearly weightless in comparison. And his skin was much paler, even by Obo’s standards.
At Seb’s urging, Mandri carried the Mazid back to the makeshift camp in the middle of Minting Rock’s rubble, for that is where Ayram sat.
The giant had his broad back turned, uncovered, and he was sitting on a wooden stool that had been scavenged from wreckage. The witch Elrahet was checking this incredible wall of flesh for wounds. The stool squeaked and groaned every time Ayram shifted his weight, but he was perfectly silent as the old witch sewed up a severe gash that wrapped around his side. As she worked, she washed away the sand from his tightly sculpted skin with a wet rag. The man was animal skinny and strong, and each time he lifted his arm to give Elrahet clearance to scrub, the striations in his shoulders popped and his shoulder blade melted into a pool of rippling muscle.
He glanced over his shoulder and noticed Seb approaching empty handed. “Seb, you soilbucket! Did you find it?” 
Seb ducked under the words with a reverent bow. “When did I never do what I said I was gonna do?”
“Where is it?”
Seb stepped aside to reveal Mandri carrying the Mazid.
“Put it over there,” Elrahet snapped as she pointed with her elbow.
Laying on the ground nearby was the Mazidariga child, dead. Mandri laid Obo down next to it. Both were swaddled in black, with only their faces open to the air. They looked oddly like siblings—their skin had that same cloudy pallor. Obo was the bigger of the two, or he would have been if he hadn’t had his legs chopped off.
Ayram sighed and his shoulders slumped. Then he slapped his knees and stood up, against Elrahet’s protestations. He twisted back and forth to test the stitchwork that riddled his side, and when this sent a thin stream of blood dribbling down his ribs, he stole a long, thin strip of wool from a white Hrkan cloak and bandaged himself up. Elrahet tried to help, but he pointed with his bearded chin towards the twin corpses, Obo and the Riga.
“Go and do it,” he said.
Elrahet grumbled, then waddled over to the corpses and shooed Seb and Mandri aside. She then straightened the bodies out so that they lay flat on their backs, bellies even, and she knelt in between their heads, making sure the skirt of her robe folded nicely to make a pillow for her creaky knees. 
From nowhere, that golden blade flashed in her hands, shining bright in the red light of the setting sun. The sight of it turned Mandri’s stomach.
Elrahet’s head craned towards the sky, and the speech that ushered from her throat was so polluted with guttural urks that Mandri wondered if they were even words. Not even the croaks of vomiting toads sounded so much like her gibberish. After the witch croaked through a garbled verse, she bent low over the Riga child and with her blade she cut the air around it, as if freeing it from some invisible tether, and when that was done she raised her arm and slammed her knife into Riga’s black-robed belly, burying the knife up to the hilt.
The Riga child’s eyes flicked open and bulged as if trying to escape its skull, one red eye twisting left, the other twisting right. Mandri wondered if its brain might be exploding. Then the whole body juddered, and the little legs spasmed, kicking sand onto Ayram’s boot. Elrahet pushed down on the Riga’s hips with her free hand to steady the creature, and when the jerking finally settled down, she ripped the blade from the stomach, bent over the wound, then set her lips upon it.
Every fiber of Mandri’s being wanted to look away from this unholy sight, but he couldn’t—such is the allure of dark and twisted things. The Riga wasn’t human, but it looked enough like an innocent child that Mandri felt shame for staring, and he nearly fainted when the witch slurped up blood from the hole in the Riga’s belly. A trickle of red dripped from her scrunched-up withered lips as she swung around to kiss the lips of Obo. But of course, it was more crude than a kiss—she squeezed Obo’s jaw open, and spit the contents of her mouth into Obo’s throat. Out came blood and chunks of viscera, and so too came a formless gray light, the same glowing ember that Mandri had seen zip out of Obo’s body before the battle of Minting Rock began.
Elrahet shut Obo’s jaw, clenched it tight with her leathery palm, and set to whispering that guttural language into Obo’s ear. She held her dagger aloft Obo’s throat and nicked the air above, seeming to brush Obo’s corpse with her blade as she played at guiding the ember down into his stomach. When she was finished, she set her ear to Obo’s heart, closed her eyes, and listened. 
A stillness settled over those gathered as they waited for something magical to happen.
Then Elrahet’s beady eye snapped wide as if struck by thunder.
“Boy! Quick!” 
Her eye fixed on Mandri and she  waved him towards her.
Mandri hobbled over and she grabbed his wrist then yanked him down to his knees, right next to Obo’s body.
“Squeeze the hand,” she said, and she held up her own bony claw of a hand to demonstrate, clutching some invisible stone and pumping it with her fist.
Mandri held up his hand and did the same.
She slapped him across the cheek.
“The other hand!”
He held up his poulticed wrist. The weedy thing was no longer oozing black. Elrahet reached out with her knife, and with a quick flick she cut through the bandage that held it all together. The poultice meat sloughed off to reveal the nub of his wrist coated, and between the coin-splotches of dried black paste was a web of fresh pink skin. Though it was healed, it looked diseased against his natural brown complexion.
“Squeeze the hand ,” Elrahet said as she rubbed Obo’s chest.
Mandri imagined his severed hand clutching Obo’s heart, and he squeezed with all his invisible might. 
Obo’s ribcage thumped.
Mandri gasped in shock.
He squeezed again, and another thump bumped up.
“Harder,” Elrahet growled.
Mandri’s determination deepened, such that he was no longer breathing. Sweat beaded on his brow, and just when it seemed that he would faint, Obo opened his eyes. 
“Sol’s light,” Mandri muttered. He sat back into his heels and heaved a sigh of relief.
Bleary-eyed Obo slowly glanced around, first to his right, to Elrahet’s sneering visage, then to Ayram’s blood spattered self, then to the black rubble of Minting Rock behind him, and then he squinted at the pile bodies beyond. When he turned his head and saw Mandri, his lips crumpled into a weak smile, broken when Ayram’s great paw gripped Obo’s whole head and lifted the Mazid up to lean him against a rock.
Ayram turned to Mandri and said, “Command it. Make it do something.”
“Do what?”
“Make it hiss like a lizard.”
“The boy is not ready for true work,” said Elrahet. “When his leg is mended, when his mind is steadied, then we shall make him Minder. A more urgent matter threatens our fate.”
“The Mazidariga?”
“Damn right,” said Seb, who was crouching nearby like a sandrat waiting for someone to drop a crumb of bread. Ayram silenced the wiry woman with a sideways glance, then he glowered at Obo and asked, “How many Mazidariga are there?”
“I don’t know,” Obo answered. “More than one. Or rather, more than you can run from. You can be assured you will be hunted until killed. However, there is a peaceable solution to that particular problem which I’m sure you’ll find agreeable.”
“Out with it.”
Elrahet snarled the answer. “The Mazid wants a Spark.”
“Yes, but there is another way around the Riga.”
“How?”
“Before I answer, I’d like to know why you took me captive. Don’t say it was to kill some demon. Do you want me to drive Hrk’s armies into the sea? Lay waste to every Hrkan temple? Kill every Lord? The prospective Lords, too?”
Ayram picked up his spear and began to wipe it with a rag. Both its ends, the chisel and ball, were solid red, as if made of a different metal.
Ayram said, “I don’t want you to kill a Lord. I don’t want you to kill a demon. I want you to kill the Amalgamete.”
“There’s no use in it,” Elrahet grumbled.
Obo was quick to counter her. “I don’t think that’s true. You see, if this is all an act of rebellion, then I am on your side. I would welcome a change in the continent’s leadership. The Lords are weak and fractious. They create more problems than they solve.”
“You aren’t getting a Spark,” said Elrahet brusquely.
“Simmer down, it’s only talk,” said Ayram. “Either it says something sensible, or we ignore it.” He leaned on his spear and asked intently, “How do we elude these Mazidariga demons?”
“Before I get to that, please, stop and consider—what is the one thing the Hrkan Lords are scared of?”
“You?” Elrahet grouched.
“Yes, but no. You see, I was made to help manage that one thing that checks the Hrkan Lords—that is the Hrkan people. You may think that I was made to terrorize you, but the Lords don’t care about the outland tribes. You’re tangential. In fact, they’ve sympathy for you if you can believe it. The guild is the only thing holding the common folk back from stealing what arable lands you people have left. If your goal is to plunge Hrk into chaos, you’ll be signing your own writ of doom.”
Ayram chuckled and shook his head. “I know what the Hrkan people can do.”
“Then why agitate them?” Obo asked. The force of his argument was working an energy into him. If his arms were able to move underneath his swaddling robe, they would have been going mad. “If you want Hrk to fall cleanly, you have to be precise. You needn’t a Mazid to do this. Kill a few choice men and women, the ones keeping the corruption in check, as well as a few others who bridge the nation’s natural divisions. Apply some pressure to the right places, and Hrk will fall apart under its own weight. That would be a more manageable decline. It might take some time, but believe me, Hrk hates itself more than it hates you. Simply get them to no longer want to be a nation, and they won’t be. That will give your outland tribes room to breathe.”
“You speak as if you have experience tearing down kingdoms.”
“How do you think Hrk tore down the Old Jandri world? It wasn’t Mazidfire. Disagreement is the natural impulse of your kind, prey on that, and any nation in the world would spiral into a cycle of death as soon as first blood is drawn.”
“The thing you don’t understand,” said Ayram, “Is that I don’t care about Hrk. I don’t care about the outland tribes. What I do care about is killing the Amalgamete.”
Obo looked deeply into Ayram’s eyes, as if to gauge the man’s sincerity. Mandri, in turn, looked to Elrahet, who was as set in stone as her leader. Seb seemed less convinced of the mission, though she was more difficult to read. It was difficult to know what lay behind her scowl at a glance—it was probably nothing more than a too-sour borcandi spine, as a string of juice was dripping from her lip.
For Mandri’s part, he was alarmed. He’d remembered what Ayram had named the Amalgamete back in the pit-cave—he’d called it a god-swallower.
“I don’t understand,” said Obo, stealing the words right out of Mandri’s mind. “If there’s this great evil running around, why not let Hrk deal with it?”
Elrahet thrust her cane in the air and shouted, “We don’t have time for this!”
Obo squirmed inside his black swaddling robe. “You went through all this, because you need me to kill a demon?”
“It is the Lord of demons.”
“Why not poke it with your spear?”
“It’s very big.”
“How big?”
Ayram leaned on his spear and said firmly, “How do we avoid the Mazidariga?” 
“Well that’s simple,” said Obo. “Actually, the solution was in your grasp just now, but true to form you’ve squandered the opportunity.”
“Out with it.”
“You could capture a Riga after it has whistled the pseudospark out of my body, then you could walk wherever you please unmolested. You would then wake me once you reached your destination.”
Seb stood up and said, “Wait a finger—are you saying that we could have—”
Ayram waved Seb off, but Obo answered her anyway. “Yes, you could have carried me and my poor cousin around the Sand free from the worry of the Hrkan hunt. Or, you could end all difficulties by giving me a Spark.” He mounted his argument before anyone had time to laugh. “One distant whistle from a Mazidariga will end me. If I had my own shard of the divine, then it stands to reason that I would be freed from the Mazidariga’s influence entirely.”
“Free from the hunt,” Ayram muttered.
Elrahet added, “Freed from a Minder as well.”
“Yes,” said Obo. “But if you give me a Spark, you would be giving me my freedom. I said it before and it will always be true—in return for such a gift, I would slay anything you wished.”
Elrahet said, “Tell me, creature, if a true Spark danced in your belly, what would stop you from killing us? What would stop you from violating your word?”
“Nothing,” Obo admitted.
“Behold!” she shrieked. “A truth! None will come as quickly from a puppet’s tongue. I’d sooner trust the creature with a venomed blade than a Spark. We’re better off stumbling blind into a nest of battles.”
Ayram smirked. “We’ll make do without its wisdom. And we should make ready. We’ll have to outpace the Hrks.”
“To where?” Obo asked.
“We make for the bones of Bullr, then we head south to the Goree Mountains.”
Obo was unimpressed. “The Bullr basin is surrounded by Hrkan posts. If there was a lord of demons dwelling anywhere near there, it would have been noticed.”
“The demon isn’t hiding in the bones. It hides in the Goree.”
“Where in the Goree?”
“I don’t know.”
“You don’t know?”
Ayram’s grin spread wide inside the bloody bush of his beard. “This may surprise you, Mazid, but I can know things which I don’t know.”
Obo was not surprised. Neither was Mandri. The biggest of all outland pokes was unable to distinguish between knowledge and gut instinct—this was one of the least surprising things in all of Solraheen’s creation. Also unsurprising was the sad truth that other pokes went along with it. Absurd, but not surprising, as size is certainty in the Sand.
The only surprising bit was Elrahet. This woman had knowledge of the Spark, visions of the future, and yet, she was content to call herself Ayramun. It was because of her that Mandri feared the truth of the Amalgamete, though not just her. He’d now met two witches wielding golden knives, and both speaking of a godlike being. Importantly, they didn’t disagree about this god’s existence, but whether or not it needed to be killed.
Mandri decided that Obo ought to know about that other witch, Pel, the one who’d started him on this journey. Perhaps it might change Obo’s mood if he knew that these pokes weren’t the only ones preaching about an Amalgamete. It might make Obo more amenable to his Minding. If the Amalgamete were real, then all of this might make sense.
He found himself hoping it was real. It would be a real shame for that big pile of bodies to mean absolutely nothing. If it didn’t mean anything, then any old passing artist could stumble by and make it mean whatever they wanted, and that would be a shame.</Text>

            <Title>Ugmukheen</Title>
            <Text>Mandri moaned as his sleep-crusted eyes split open and discovered a dark room. He lay quietly, regretting his reinsertion into the causal flow of reality.
The God’s Eye burgeon had been that good.
He didn’t remember any of it, but he remembered it was good.
When his eyes adjusted to the dimness, he discovered that he had, somehow, been brought back up to the temple’s ladder room. It was empty, save for him. The tumble of coals were still there, and the Ayramun’s packs were still there, so he hadn’t been left behind. He decided to climb the ladder and see if anyone was lounging around outside. He hoped someone was up there preparing a meal. The passing of the God’s Eye burgeon had left him hungry.
He climbed up the ladder’s rungs and as he moved the soreness in his body worked itself out quickly.
That must have been the work of the God’s Eye burgeon, too.
He decided to ask Seb about it as soon as he got the chance, but that would be all he would ask—he would have to pretend to remember everything that had happened down in that cave, including walking back himself, because he didn’t want to give Seb the impression that he couldn’t handle a single sliver of that beautiful burgeon.
Mandri pulled himself up onto the cobbled black stone of the tiny desert temple floor. He kept calling it a temple, but there was no altar or kneeling stone—only that hole in the ground and the wooden ladder. There was a scrawl of Old Jandri script circumscribing the inner dome, but Mandri couldn’t read it. He guessed it told of the life of some dead desert father who’d died here and was buried in a crypt somewhere down below. He shuddered at the thought of a life wasted in service to a long dead god.
He stepped out into the cool air and was surprised to find it was evening. He’d slept through the day, and soon, he assumed, they would be moving again.
All of the Ayramun were gathered to the right, at the top of the nearest hill. They stood with backs turned, facing west, facing the setting sun. They were a remarkable set of outland pokes, all different sizes, and with Obo included, still strapped in his litter and leaning against Ayram’s leg, they ranged from the smallest person alive to the largest. Only Seb, at the end of the line, turned and regarded Mandri’s presence. This he did with a smirk and a wink, and Mandri felt compelled to return the courtesy. 
Mandri scrambled up the hill to join him, and as soon as he arrived all schemes of stealing Seb’s God’s Eye burgeons fled from thought, for it was not the setting sun which stretched out above the horizon, but a heavy black cloud as dark as the oncoming night. And it was more than a cloud. It was the Lord of clouds for it stretched out across the world and churned it over. It could have been mistaken for a rampaging herd of mountains, if such a thing were possible. And though it was dark, Mandri was struck by its color, for its upper reaches pierced the shadow of the world's edge to catch the fleeing light day—at the top, a tip of gold, shading into red, oozing into pink, then a wall of reddish-black cloud all the way to the desert floor.
The sense of magnificence was helped along by little westwind zephyrs tickling Mandri’s skin. So far as he could tell, this storm was coming straight for them. 
“Holy shit,” he muttered.
“Nothin’ holy about it,” Seb croaked. He was standing next to Mandri, arms crossed, and for once he wasn’t chewing a spine—it hung there on his lip, forgotten. “Big ‘ol bastard, ain’t it?”
This storm was much bigger than that. It was an Ugmukheen, a child of Mukh, inheritor of His wrath. To Mandri’s knowledge, the Sand hadn’t seen a storm anywhere near this size for at least three hundred years, for that’s when Muk had perished.
Obo was as taken by the sight of the storm as everyone else.
“It is unnatural,” he said in wonder. This was the most honest emotion Obo had uttered since Mandri knew him.
“Of course it’s natural,” Seb said. “Everything that happens is natural.”
“It’s coming from an impossible direction,” said Obo.
Moto peaked around Ayram’s figure so that he could sneer at the Mazid as he said, “What would you know about the Ugmukheen?”
Obo countered by saying, “I’ve read every book and scroll that counts the weather in this part of the world, and every Ugmukheen for the past thousand years was born abreast the Gongee Sea.”
“So?”
“When the high Gongee winds stop blowing—it’s like taking the lid off a pot of steaming water. That’s how they’re made. And the Gongee Sea is four days to the south, not west. That’s not to mention that an Ugmukheen does not look like that.”
Moto was unimpressed. “Clearly, they do look like that.”
“Have you ever been caught in a Ugmukheen?” Obo asked him.
“No. Have you?”
“No.”
“The Mazid’s right,” said Ayram. “A true Ugmukheen is a thing you don’t see coming. The first you know of it is when your own dust overtakes you. You can survive an Ugmukheen. You can not survive a thing like that.” He pointed to the distant storm with his iron spear and said, “A storm like that would flay the toughest hide. That’s no Ugmukheen.”
Elrahet, who’d been brooding under her hood, said, “This must be Pell. Her and no one else. Every god who could have brought such a storm upon the world is long dead.”
Seb said, “We can’t walk the Sand with that monster runnin’ us down.”
Elrahet nodded and said, “We stay in the hole. And we pray to all that is holy that these hills don’t eat us.”
“But what about the Hrks,” Moto whined. “If we don’t keep moving, the Hrks will catch us long before we reach Bullr.”
Seb said, “There’s got to be another way.”
“We could try for the Kari plain,” said Moteah.
Ayram shook his head and stroked his beard. “Not the Kari.”
“Could try the Goree Pass,” said Seb.
“The Goree Pass…” Ayram repeated as his fingers twirled his beard tips.
“The Goree will never work,” said Moto.
“Why not?” Seb asked.
“Because the Goree Pass is cursed. It’s as cursed as that damned storm.”
“Not cursed enough for the Greskalun to live there,” Seb replied.
“But its not just the curse. Those damned Rigas will be at the Goree Pass long before we get there.” 
“If this storm curves north once it passes, then it’ll get in their way and give us room.”
“And what if it doesn’t curve north?”
Ayram answered for Seb and said, “Then I’ll have to think of something else. But I like the Goree Pass. Greskal could help us. The man hates Hrk as much as anyone.”
Every time Ayram pulled at his beard and twirled out a tuft of hair, the hair sprang right back into that smooth, bread-loaf shape. Mandri grew a little jealous, because he’d always wanted a nice full beard but his chin wasn’t up to it.
“That’s what we’re doing,” Ayram finally declared. “We wait out the storm, then head for the Goree.”
With that, he picked Obo’s litter up, then turned and side-step shuffled back down the hill. Moto stamped after him to fret about this change of plans. Of the rest of the Ayramun, Moteah seemed most unaffected. She was standing on a black rock which put her up a foot higher than the rest. She had a long reedy stick which she’d brought with her from the western plain below, and with it she drew little abstract faces, and then she’d watch the wind brush them away grain by grain.
Seb was watching the storm looking pleased with himself.
“Well,” Mandri said suggestively, “We suddenly find ourselves in possession of some recreational time.”
Seb patted his pocket and what-do-you-know, he nodded and wandered back down the hill.
Mandri couldn’t follow too quickly as he’d arouse too much suspicion. Someone would ask why he wanted to waste the day with Seb.
When he’d waited long enough he said, “Well, I’ll just, uh…I’ll go find something to eat.”
He scrambled down the hill to go find Seb and burgeons.
Unfortunately, Moto found him first. The man was climbing up the temple ladder just as Mandri was about to climb down, and when Moto was up and out he blocked Mandri’s way with his sword’s scabbard.
“Where are you going?” he asked.
“To find a snack.”
“No free food until you show me you can earn your keep.”
In his other hand was a Hrkan short sword in a tawny scabbard that he’d salvaged from the battle of Minting Rock. He extended this out towards Mandri, hilt first, clearly expecting Mandri to take it.
“I can’t imagine what you’d want me to do with this,” Mandri said. “Need me to dig out a big splinter or something?”
Moto was not amused. “Do you remember our conversation?”
“Nope,” said Mandri, biting his tongue.
“I was going easy on you then. Now that you’re out here with us, I’ll be harder. Take the goddamned sword.”
Mandri hesitated, but the man was serious, so he grabbed the sword and followed Moto back outside. The burgeons would have to wait.
Obo was outside as well, propped against the temple’s wall. When Moto noticed him, he said, “You could learn something too and pass it on to your Hrkan Lords. Their Skulsi are shitty fighters.”
“Yes, I heard how you and Ayram cut them down.”
“They’re brave, I’ll give them that.”
“Too brave,” said Obo.
“You’d rather they were cowards?”
Obo looked so strange, swaddled up like he was, like an overgrown baby, nine months old with the face of an ageless eunuch. Stranger still to see him adopt the air of a lecturer and say, “In the Hrkan art of war, there’s no such thing as cowardice. There’s no such thing as bravery, either, for bravery and cowardice are both symptoms of unpreparedness. There is only preparedness, and unpreparedness. If a soldier is ever called on to be brave or a coward, then his commander has failed him.”
“Of all the shadows from Shis,” Moto muttered. “What are you talking about?”
Obo continued on, as if reciting some long-remembered scriptural writ, “ Either the fighting man is fully prepared for what he faces and he is victorious, or his commander has failed and he must kill himself.”
Moto ambled several paces away and he drew his gold-trimmed sword with a flourish. “You can be as prepared as you can possibly be, but still face bad odds. That’s what calls for bravery.”
“If a commander’s soldiers face unbalanced odds, then the commander has failed in his maneuvers and his men have arrived to battle unprepared. Such a commander should kill himself—these are not my words, they are Lord Kashkan’s.”
“Alright, lesson number one, Mandri—don’t ever listen to a Hrk.”
“I already don’t,” said Mandri.
“Lesson number two—always run away from a fight if you can.”
Mandri dropped his sword in the dirt. Obo caught on and declared, “He’s a prodigy.”

“Can I first ask why we’re doing this?”
“No.”
“I’ll do whatever I can to help you guys out, but me swinging a sword isn’t it. I’m more likely to hurt myself than a Hrk.”
“We’re doing simple stuff here, Mandri, believe me, I know you can’t handle too much, so I’m giving you what you can handle. So answer my question. Or should we I go find another lizard pit?”
“Okay, I’ll play,” Mandri said as he picked up his sword.
“Now answer my question.”
“I forgot what it was.”
Obo chuckled, and Moto clicked his teeth in annoyance.
He said, “If you’re in a fight, what are you trying to do?”
“Survive.”
“Be more specific.”
“Run away.”
“Alright, fine, running away is good.”
“Okay, this is ridiculous—what are we doing here?”
Moto was almost at his wits end already. When he’d first drawn his sword, his shoulders were eager, now they were struggling to care. But his mouth was still going.
“In the event that you can’t run away, what is another specific goal you can set out for yourself?”
“Kill my enemy before he kills me.”
//
“If you live long enough you may learn something about the art of killing.”
“There’s nothing artful about killing,” said Obo. “I’ve seen enough to know.”
“You wouldn’t judge the entire art of painting from a child’s scribblings, would you? You’ve only ever seen a child’s scribblings.”
Mandri added, “You think you’re an artist?”
Moto replied. “All artists are trying to get at the human heart, I simply take the most direct approach. The only difference is that the best artist is a matter of opinion, but the best swordsman—that’s a matter of fact.”
Moto was too full of himself, so Mandri decided to prick his skin and ask, “Then who is the best swordsman? You?”
“I might be.”
“Who would win in a fight, you or Ayram?”
The answer was obvious, but Moto was taking a little too long to answer. He rubbed his head in frustration, as if the question was one of those utterances that made semantic sense but signified nothing, a stumbling block for would-be philosophers.
“That depends on too many things,” Moto said. “There’s not enough context.”
“The context is you versus Ayram.”
Moto eyed his blade and his face went through such a series of contortions that he could have charged money to see the act. Somewhere in there was the suggestion that it was offensive to even ask the question. He went through a few different shades of disappointment as well, like he was upset with himself for letting things stray too far away from the lesson at hand, and upset at Mandri for even existing. In the end, frustration won out and he said, “You know what? We’re done here. If you don’t want help staying alive,  you won’t get it.”
Moto stomped past and fled into the temple. Before his head disappeared down the ladder, he paused and said bitterly, “Keep the sword.”
Mandri and Obo shared impish smiles, though Obo was a little more practical. “We should probably head down as well.”
“Why?”
“The storm.”
“Oh.”
Mandri sheathed his sword and tucked in into his waistband. He then hauled Obo into the temple and down the ladder. Once down, he wandered off to find Seb, but the idiot had gone to sleep. Instead of enjoying a mind-splitting burgeon, Mandri waited in boredom with the rest of the Ayramun.
It did not take long for the storm to overtake them.
First came its shadow as the storm blocked out the rising sun, leaving the air outside suffused with a dim orange glow. Then came the soothing sound of wind-whipped sand splashing against the temple’s bricks above. Every now and then a gust of wind would blow into the temple entrance and swirl around inside, and if this wind was strong enough, it blew through the hole in floor, turning the ladder room and the tunnel beyond into a sort of flute—the faint whimpering whine sounded startlingly similar to the birthing fits of the brown mutts back in Meskalim.
As the wind intensified, this whine steadied into a droll hum, a sound so annoying that all the Ayramun retreated deep into the tunnel behind the ladder. Only Mandrameen and Obo stayed in the ladder room. Obo was there because no one could be bothered to pick him up and move him. Mandri stayed because he was mesmerized by the sight and sound of the storm outside. Being near to a monstrous, blossoming power was intoxicating.
“You know, I can kind of see why they want to free Solraheen,” he said as the air outside grew dark. “If He could make this storm, then just imagine the kind of power He has.”
“Solraheen didn’t make this storm,” said Obo. “As I’m sure you are aware, He is incapacitated at the moment.”
“He might not have made this particular storm, but He made…you know…He made the structure for it. He made the world that made it.”
“How profound,” said Obo, sarcastically.
“It’s not profound to say He’s the only true creator. A painter moves paint around, but that’s not real creation. Solraheen, he created the wind, he created the Sand from nothing. That kind of creativity is the only thing that makes life worth living.” 
Mandri was feeling philosophical, and he settled into a cozy mood. All that was missing was some burgeon beer to complete it. A nice freeweed wrap would do as well, but he didn’t usually go in for those. The warm dimness and the humbling immensity of the storm outside was working wonders on his stress. Satisfying, too, was the knowledge that he didn’t have to do damned thing, at least not for a good long while.
He asked Obo, “Do you have any beliefs? Does a Mazid believe anything?”
“What do you mean?”
“Eh, nevermind. Forget I asked. I’m just happy you’re here with me.”
“I’m touched,” said Obo, delighted. “And I should say the same. Without you it’d just be me amongst these Ayramun, and that would be horrific.”
“Have you thought at all about how to escape?”
“I don’t want to escape.”
“Why not?”
“I’ve thought about it, and where would I go? Back to Hrk? Never. These people, rough as they are, they’re my only chance at freedom. Do you know any other witches with knowledge of the Spark? I haven’t been alive long, but I’ve been looking for someone like Elrahet my whole life.”
“Wait, how old are you?”
“I am seven years old.”
“Seven!? Damn. I thought you were going to say like five-hundred. But really, seven? I bet it’s been a shitty seven years, too.”
“It has.”
“Well, you know what, Obo? If you stay, I’ll stay. Sol knows I’ve got nowhere else to be. You know, you deserve a Spark more than I do. I’d give you mine if I could, but I can’t exactly help you with that. You have my moral support.”
The two of them sat in contemplated silence for half a hand, when Obo ruined it by saying, half in jest but entirely serious,“Is this what friendship feels like?”
“Obo,” Mandri sighed. “You don’t say something like that out loud. You just feel it. Dwell in it.”
“I’m sorry, I haven’t done this before.”
“I can tell. Now stop talking about it. When you talk about it, you make it boring.”
“It’s not boring to me.”
“Look, when people start talking about their emotions and stuff, I have this physical reaction to it, and it’s annoying, so stop.”
“How so?”
“My legs get hot.”
“Your legs get hot?”
“Yes, that’s what I said. Now shut up about it.”
Mandri got up and fashioned some pillows out of what packs had been left in the room. He gave a quick look for Seb’s pack, because a drop of God’s Eye would significantly improve the moment, but of course Seb had expected this and brought his pack along with him. Mandri was forced, against his will, to lay there sober and watch the hole in the ceiling as the storm’s rage continued to build.
Hand after hand passed like this, and all the while the winds outside were rising. His thoughts turned to children’s stories, the ones that warned about the Ugmukheen. They came with instructions—hide the women, for as it passes it may fill their wombs. Beware the cough that can kill as vast quantities of sand are unavoidably inhaled. Have water, for it will strip the air of moisture, and its heat will sear the lungs. Mandri felt all these things coming on, except of course, the pregnancy. But the one thing he hadn’t seen was the snap and crack of lightning leaping from every surface. The stories were clear on that—the air should come alive with little lightnings. 
Soon, the heat increased until the air was as hot as an oven. Mandri moved to flap his arms to air out his sweaty pits, and the motion conjured up a shocking spark.
He yelped in surprise.
“Your hair looks ridiculous,” said Obo.
Mandri reached up and half the hairs on his head were standing on end. His excitement at this electric thrill was tempered by the sound of rock sliding atop rock.
It was coming from the temple above.
“The wind is lifting the dome,” said Obo, with a hint of worry.
“Should we be in here?”
“I would say that we should be fine, but, you never know.”
Mandri repositioned his makeshift cot as far away from the hole as room allowed, shocking himself several times as he did. Before he was finished, an especially loud howl of wind kicked a gout of sizzling sand into the temple above, and it was followed by a splitting shock of thunder.
CRACKABOOOM
All Mandri saw was a flash of white light and then, suddenly, blackness. The temple above had caved in on itself, and the circle in the ceiling disappeared.
Mandri  shuffled back against the wall for he could hear a torrent of Sand pouring down into the room, and soon he felt it licking at his ankles. His great fear of being buried alive was short-lived, for soon the hole above was plugged by a glut of bricks.
“Well...that’s not good,” he said as one last wisp of sand puffed down—the sad, dying breath of another Old Jandri relic. </Text>

that Solraheen, in His infinite wisdom, He knew how to create every kind of thing—the birds of the air, the fish of the sea, you and me, but He is the ultimate creator, and he delights in different mediums, and so He married the wind and sand together and their oldest child is the Erg.
 “

Obo explained how dunes move. One might expect that they drift across the desert, but that isn’t it. They seem to disappear and reappear further downwind, as if moved by magic. What really happens is that the wind whips the grains of sand into ballistic arcs, and where they fall, they accumulate, and as time passes the whole dune itself seems to have melted and reconstituted further away.
Mandri wondered, since the wind in the Sand blew east more often than not, then shouldn’t the wind have wiped the desert clean of sand?
“If the land were left alone,” said Obo, “All this sand would, indeed, blow itself into the mountains or the sea.” 
“So why hasn’t it all disappeared?”
Obo explained that as much sand was being made as being taken away. The endless hordes of axes and cattle have never stopped chomping at the grass and trees. With no roots, the soil gets washed away, then compacted at the bottoms of valleys and plains. A few unlucky droughts later and it all ends up dry as a bone, a big heap of sand for the wind to pick up and add to the rest.
It reminded Mandri of his own bone-dry farm, and he wondered if all that parched dirt might soon end up out here.
“But what would happen to the dunes if that weren’t true? What if all the people and all the herds suddenly disappeared?”
“Do you want them to?” Obo asked.


//
On the sixth day, or was it the seventh? On the seventh day, Mandri saw a brilliant blue butterfly. It fluttered in the middle of an empty expanse of tan sand and gray rock. The butterfly was probably just as surprised to see him.
“Which is stranger,” Obo said, “This butterfly being out here, or you and me?”
“Probably you,” said Mandri. “There’s only, what, ten Mazidai?”
“Eleven. I am the tenth.”
“I know what Obo means. My point is, anyone who sees a Mazid is going to be surprised.”
“I don’t exactly blend in, do I?”

That night it was Purl’s turn to tell a story. She flashed a meek smile and said no. Moteah and Elrahet wouldn’t have it. Purl said she didn’t like how excited she got when she told stories. A round of routine urging ensued, and Purl proceeded to talk about a lizard.
“My story is about the daughter of a white-tailed lizard. White-tails, if you don’t know, like to live in mounds made out of their own shit.”
“That’s not quite true,” said Obo.
“It is in this story. This lizard family—a mother, father, and their thirty children—they lived in a mound made entirely out of their own shit. Whenever someone had to shit, they looked for a wall that needed mending and they let loose. Then the sun baked the shit into a shit brick, part of a shit house, and that was that.”
“Charming,” said Obo, drawing glares to be quiet.
“Now, one lizard daughter didn’t like living in a mound a shit. Her parents asked her, ‘What’s wrong? Why don’t you like it here?’ and the daughter said, obviously, ‘because this place is a mound of shit.’ The father pretended to laugh, and said, ‘Very funny. Now go fix the front door’.
This drew a chorus of chuckles. Seb blew some farting noises into his elbow. He loved it.
“This lizard daughter was a dutiful daughter, and so she did what her father commanded, she lifted her tail and pooped on the front door. Still, she didn’t like living in a mound of shit. She went back to the father and said, ‘Why can’t we be like the finches, who live in cups of sticks and moss? Why can’t we be like the rats, who live deep underground in burrows? Or why can’t we be like the humans, who live wherever they want?’
“The father said, ‘We do not have wings, so where are we going to get sticks and moss? We do not have digging claws, so how can we dig into the earth? We do not have beer, so how can we live wherever we want? No, my daughter,, we have to count on what we do have, and what we do have is our poop. Now go chew a hole in the living room wall, we’re looking to expand.’
“Dutifully, the daughter chewed a hole in the living room wall. Her mouth was full of her family’s leavings, and she realized, now more than ever, that she didn’t like living in a mound of shit. She decided then and there that enough was enough and she was going to leave. So she wiggled out of her home and set off into the desert.’
“She didn’t return home for five years, which, for a white-tail, made her old enough to be a grandmother. Her parents were long dead. One of her lizard brothers now owned the mound.’
“The brother, trying to be the most gracious host, invited his long lost sister inside for dinner. The sister declined. When the brother asked why, the sister answered, ‘I’ve traveled the world and have slept in the houses of birds, rats, and humans, and I’ve even snuck into a snake’s den! None of them were so foul as this.’
“The brother said, ‘Come now, sister, it’s not that bad. We’ve added a second floor.’ The sister said, ‘No thank you,’ and she left. As she left, she heard her brother shout at one of her many children who was avoiding his chores. He said, ‘The floor should be clean enough to eat off!’
“The old sister grew sad at this parting. After all the glorious homes she’d seen, it hurt to see her brother and his family living in such squalor. She decided to do something about it. She thought that all her relatives needed was a push out the door and they’d see for themselves that a mound of shit is the worst kind of house to live in.
“So she journeyed back to the snake whose home she’d snuck into. This time, however, she revealed herself to the snake. She said to the snake, ‘I know you want to eat me, but if you can hold your appetite, I will lead you to a mound of shit that is crawling with lizards. It will be the easiest meal of your life.’
“The snake was skeptical. It asked the old lizard, ‘Why would you betray your kin like this?’ And the lizard said, ‘I will lead you there if you promise to leave at least one boy and one girl alive, so that they can carry on the family name. Also, and this is the most important thing, you have to completely destroy that mound of shit.’
“The snake wasn’t sure if he wanted to do it. He had no arms and legs, so if he wanted to destroy the mound he’d have to roll around in it. But the promise of an easy meal was too good to pass up, so he said to the old lizard, ‘lead on’.
“The lizard led the snake back to her brother’s home, and the snake did what he promised. He ate the brother and his wife, and most of their children too, and he rolled around in the pile of dried shit, crushing it into dust. Only two lizards survived, a boy and a girl. Without a home they were forced to wander around in the desert. Their old, kinslaying aunt followed them from afar, eager to see how they fared. She was careful not to intrude on the new experiences that awaited them. 
“Eventually, the young brother and sister got tired of not having a permanent home. The girl said to her brother, ‘I just want my own bed to sleep in.’
“The boy said, ‘I wish the same. We should build a house.’
“‘How do you build a house?’
“‘I don’t know. What was it that grandfather was always saying?’
“‘He always said that all we’ve got is our poop.’ 
“And it just so happened that right next to them was a brick of poop that one of them had left sitting there from the day before. And I’m sure you know what happened next—the two lizards built a new house of shit to live in.
“When their old aunt saw that her niece and nephew had reverted back to the old ways, she became distressed. She wandered back into the snake’s den, and the snake, surprised to see her, asked, ‘Why have you returned?’ To this the old lizard replied, ‘Because they can’t think of anything else but shit.’ Then the snake ate the old lizard, and that’s the end of the story.”
Mandri screwed up his nose and said, “That’s not how that story goes.”
Purl sneered back. “That’s how it goes, because that’s how I said it.”
Mandri tried to appeal to the group, all who’d certainly heard the story of the lizards and their shit before, but Ayram said, “Purl’s right. The storyteller makes the rules.”
“Fine,” said Mandri. “But it’s a little contrived for my tastes.”
“What does that mean?”
“I don’t know. I’m going to sleep.”


Mandri knelt down, picked up a dropped wafer of hardtack and noticed a small gray lizard. It looked at him without really looking at him—one eye trained on him, the other eye swiveling in its socket to stare at everything else. Mandri admired its vigilance. He wasn’t dangerous, but the lizard didn’t know that. 
He thought about how exhausting that little lizard’s life must be, having to be on-guard the whole day through, because anything that moves could be a threat. And here Mandri was, barely noticing anything. He decided, from then on, to be a bit more wary about what was going on.

Obo’s misanthropy was getting the better of him. His mood wasn’t foul, he was just discouraged. He was treating each day as his final opportunity to reach out for a Spark, and at each rejection, he grew more upset at the Ayramun, more upset at humanity.
Mandri tried to help. One afternoon, he approached Elrahet and tried to vouch for Obo. He didn’t expect to succeed, but it didn’t hurt to try. Elrahet responded gruffly, “Put it out of your mind.”
Later that day, Mandri was trying to convince Obo of humanity’s nobler pursuits—art, music, and philosophy, and all of that. Then they happened to pass an enormous rock which bore a stick-figure painting of a man screwing a goat. The painting looked older than time itself. Probably, it was the first painting ever made.
“I think this settles it,” said Obo, eyeing the too-expressive marks. “This is raw humanity.”
“You can’t judge all of us because someone wanted to make fun of Sixa the Very Great.”
“Is that what you think this is?”
“I don’t know. Look, we’ve improved. Some of us, anyways.”

            <Title>Sight Spot</Title>
            <Text>Finding Elrahet was easy because that witch never moved far from where she sat down, and that morning Seb had seen her sit down at the ambush sight spot. Getting up to her, however, was difficult. Seb could either climb up the steep cliff face, or she could take the long way around. Since she had to carry the bones she took the long way. She found the Junei road and walked it up into the mouth of the Junei pass. Instead of following that road through the mountains and all the way south to Meskalim, she scrambled off onto a smuggler’s trail which snaked up towards the mountain peaks. Before long, she hopped off that trail to follow a path which Ayram had made, one which double-backed towards the east.
It was nearing mid-day when Seb made it to the that wide, mid-cliff ledge where Elrahet was sitting. As far as ambush sight spots go, it was perfect—it offered a privileged view of everything east of the Hias mountains. Below was the mouth of the Junei Pass, out of which the Junei road poured. This unkempt road meandered down into the dark Junei hills, where it was dissected into a filigree of footpaths that wiggled down into valleys and bent around black screes and outcrops of solid rock before shooting through the ravines and bowing along the bottoms of wide, long-dried washes before emptying out, at last, into the Junei plain. Once out on the plain, all roads got lost because there the white ground is a rocky caliche that gets swept clean by the strong northerly Junsi wind.
Elrahet was alone up on that high ledge. To Seb’s blurry eyes, she was nothing but a bundle of black rags and long smoky hair flowing out the front of an old crone’s hood. She was sitting cross-legged and looked like she was communing with the vastness of the world, but really, she was sitting, watching, and waiting for their prey to rumble along.
“Took you long enough,” the witch mumbled as Seb approached.
Seb didn’t wait to catch her own breath before saying, “Gugi found some bones and—”
“I know.” 
Seb wondered how the witch knew, because the old woman hadn’t yet turned her head to see what Seb was carrying. But of course, this was, after all, the sight spot, and it had a good angle on every ravine, and on top of that, Elrahet was a witch. Who knows how far her witchy eyes could see.
“Bring them here,” Elrahet said.
Seb knew witches were cantankerous creatures, but Elrahet was especially cantankerous. Seb wondered about her age, though numbered age was rarely a thing people of the Sand tracked. A sand dune has no age, and outland witches like Elrahet were just as elemental. Her features were as dark, sharp, and solemn as any slab of sand-bitten stone. Her sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the wrinkly bark of any pepperwood tree. Her layers and layers of black-rag robe pillowed her knobbly frame and made her look a bit like a diseased crow. Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the Hias mountains themselves, and probably as old.
“Should I command your every twitch?” Elrahet snipped. “Put the bag down.”
Seb set the bag of bones down gently, not wanting to annoy the woman. She didn’t want to be shooed away before she’d heard any new witchy words. It was her great mission in life to listen when Elrahet spoke. This was a difficult mission, because not only did Elrahet harbor disdain for folks in general, she hated Seb more than most. And why shouldn’t she? As a witch above witches, Elrahet could see the plan. She knew what Seb was. And to make Seb’s quest more difficult, when Elrahet did speak, she spoke softly, hoarsely. Her throat croaked like a dying man. All her sentiments were brusque and rude. All her sentences were death sentences. 
Then there was her bloodspeech. That’s what Seb called Elrahet’s absent-minded mumbling. She called it bloodspeech because whenever the old crone spoke it, Seb’s own blood tingled, and as soon as the bag of bones was opened that bloodspeech was flowing. Elrahet reached in, bone by bone, gave it a once over, then tossed it over the cliff. Eventually she stopped, looked up at Seb and through her irascible sneer she growled,“Busy yourself.”
Seb stepped back and privately cursed herself for not handling the situation with more tact. She should have expected less. Elrahet was impossible to please. In the first few months of Seb’s journey with the Ayramun, she’d tried winning the witch over with kindness—she’d make her meals, wash her blankets, carry her things, and for all that, Elrahet called her a ‘servile goat’. If Seb ignored the woman entirely, that only enraged her. If Seb did what she wanted, exactly how she wanted it, no more or no less, then she was a ‘mindless poke’. It had been three whole years and as many months, and Seb had learned almost nothing about Elrahet’s peculiar brand of witchery.
The only bit of wisdom she’d ever heard her speak was a rather childish aphorism given to young Papi. Papi had been pouting about some useless thing and Elrahet said to him, “Every weakness is a strength, and every strength, a weakness.” If anyone else had said something as stupid as that, Seb would have disregarded it. Strength is strength. Weakness is weakness. Seb’s eyes were a weakness. If a thing was up close she could keep it sharp, but ‘way far out’ and ‘not too far off’ were smashed together into a blurry haze he called ‘out there somewhere’. She looked out on the Junei plain from that high ledge, and all she saw was a wash of white ground underneath a blur of blue sky.
The only good thing that came of her unreliable eyes was that she never had to stand watch, and while she took special pleasure in not being saddled with that chore, calling that a strength was merely twisting words. When a woman is strong she doesn’t need to twist words. For a witch steeped in the mysteries of the Spark to say a thing like that, to say ‘weakness is a strength’, then there had to be some deeper purpose underneath the surface. Elrahet only ever spoke to bend the world to her will. Her words might have been for Papi, but Seb had overheard it, and her overhearing it was no doubt as much a part of Elrahet’s intentions as if she’d heard the words directly. Elrahet was sending her down a path. Seb was sure of it.
Seb stared out at the Junei plain and tried to find the coming caravan by its aura. She knew the caravan was out there somewhere in that blur, making its way towards the pass to be set upon by the Ayramun. She let her eyes cross just enough so that the white landscape doubled and blurred until the edge between the white chaliche and the blue of the midday sky softened into a clean gradient. She strained under the effort, until, at last, there was nothing else in the world but her, that cloud of color, and the distant caravan—if indeed it was even there. She supposed it was there, and she hoped to see its aura flare. Maybe it takes bad eyes to see the divine light of purpose that shines out of every living being. Maybe that’s how her weakness was a strength.
She stared into that blur and bore the look of a woman possessed—jaw clenched tight, breathing in sips, skin tingling, stomach tense. She could feel the energy screaming out of her eyes, she was scouring all the world with it. She trembled as the gods trembled. Sweat beaded on her brow. 
Then she caught a faint whiff of a curious odor. A foul odor. Was it Elrahet’s? Was it her own?
She took another sniff and was hit with a familiar musk—it was hers.
And there were some nesting brightbeaks, up on the cliff behind. Seb knew this without looking because when brightbeaks jump out of their holes they flap their little wings so hard that they beat a pathetic, warbling whistle out of their tiny chests. One flew right by her ear.
But that brightbeak wasn’t the most distracting thing. That honor went to the way in which the borcandi juice oozed out of the spine tucked in her cheek and welled up in her mouth. Borcandi juice doesn’t play nice with the stomach, so people spit it out. But spitting would break her concentration. Then again, her concentration was already broken, so she spat—she spat out  the whole damn wad. It was as big as her tongue.
“Dammit, Seb! You’re a servant of Shis, I swear it!”
Elrahet’s accusation sent Seb into a flustered panic. A long thin track of green-gray spit lacing across the bag of bones. Thankfully, none of it had touched Elrahet.
“Aw, shit! Sorry! Shit. Didn’t mean to.”
She crouched down and tried to atone for her absent-mindedness by wiping the bag clean with her dirty sleeve.
“Get away afore I have you tossed off the cliff!”
“Didn’t mean it.”
Elrahet picked up her short, gnarled root of a walking cane and swung it at Seb’s head. Seb pulled back in time to watch it brush her nose.
Elrahet glowered and said, “I’m that close to cursing your flesh so it steams your bones.”
“I didn’t mean it. Here, let me—”
Elrahet swung again, and her backswing was faster, so fast that the cane head smacked Seb’s cheek. If the old woman had been serious, it might have broken Seb’s face.
Seb clutched her bruised cheek and stumbled back, thankful it was only a warning, though Elrahet’s withering glare said her patience would not bear another word. 
Seb cursed herself again as she trudged away. This was another of her many weaknesses—she was forgetful. She couldn’t hold onto a moment if she were alone in a pitch-black cave. People said this was because of all the spines she chewed, but Seb knew that wasn’t true because she’d always been like this. And she’d never once been in a position where her fitful mind was a strength. Gugi had said that if her mind was always jumping around then at least that means she can’t be sad for too long, and so she should be happy about that, but somehow that wasn’t true—being sad was the one thing Seb could be for too long.
She leaned over the cliff face and spat a fat loogie down. She watched it fall with some delight, though she was denied the pleasure of seeing it splat on the rocks below because the ground was far enough away to be ‘out there somewhere’.
That’s when Moto came scrambling down to the sight spot from some hidden perch up above.
Seb disliked Moto. Moto, a black man from Zos, was stronger, younger, and more skilled than Seb in every way imaginable. He was too well put together to be an Ayramun. Everyone else made do with dark, patchwork robes and nail-strapped soles for shoes, whereas Moto had silver metal buckles on his dusty black boots, and he wore an orange robe that was tucked and folded into sharp knife pleats that slanted across his chest and were kept secured by a wide and tight black sash around the belly. Moto was so clean and fastidious that he would have been at home in the upper echelon of Hrkan society. He even had a sword, a long, curved sword set inside a gold-studded scabbard. It even had a name. Worse than all of this, he had healthy teeth. Few things made Seb more aware of her own disgusting self than being in the presence of healthy teeth. A woman is hard done up when a smile does nothing but make her jealous.
Moto surveyed the Junei plain and said to Seb, “You can’t see them, can you?”
The bastard knew she couldn’t see shit. That’s who Moto was—there was a bag of dead bones not ten feet away, an ill omen just discovered, yet here Moto was taking the time to take the spit right out of Seb’s cheek.
“Course I can’t see,” said Seb, and Moto chuckled. His was a damned hearty, healthy chuckle.
“Well they’re there,” he said. “They’re on their way. Exciting, isn’t it?” He then looked down at Elrahet, pretending to notice the bones for the first time. “And who is that?”
Loath to be interrupted, Elrahet grumbled out a barely-audible, “Nothing.”
“Nothing? What does that mean?”
“Means what it means.”
“I need to know. The Mazid will be here before long. Do these bones change things?”
Elrahet stood up, grabbed the bag, and tossed it over the edge of the cliff. As the bag fell, the bones came tumbling out, cracking against the cliff face.
Elrahet turned and glared at the two pokes. Her skin was so lined with age that even the subtlest action of her brow would send it cracking into sharp relief. At the moment there was only the faintest hint of her familiar sneer. Then she huffed and shuffled down the ridge path, leaving Seb and Moto to wonder at the meaning of her sudden leaving.
“I guess that means they don’t matter,” Moto mused. “And I guess that means it’s on.”
“You sure they’re out there?” Seb asked.
Moto nodded and pointed out towards the blur. “There’s a tiny black speck and a faint cloud of dust. That would be them. That would be our target.”
“You sure that’s them?”
“Who else could it be?”
“Could be anyone.”
Moto snorted in annoyance, which was a common enough occurrence that some of the Ayramun called him a ‘rutting bull’, though they were careful to never let Moto overhear.
“Elrahet predicted that a Mazid and his Minder would be making for the pass,” he said. “And that the two would be hiding themselves in a blackwood caravan. She said they’d be coming mid-day today.” Moto pointed out to the desert again, this time with two imploring hands. “There’s a caravan out there. It’s mid-day. It all fits. That’s who we’re hunting. Or do you doubt Elrahet?”
Seb spat another loogie off the cliff. “Did Elrahet say anythin’ about a dead body?”
“No,” Moto said defensively. “Are you saying something about a dead body?”
“I’m not sayin’ nothin’, I’m lookin’ at it scattered all over these hills.”
“I don’t see why it changes anything.”
“If there’s a curse floatin’ in them hills, then Ayram should know about it.”
“Who said anything about a curse?”
“What else is a bag of bones supposed to be?”
Moto snorted again. “Everything is a curse to you. A rock stuck in your shoe is a curse. A dead leaf is a foul omen. Unless Elrahet thinks there’s something more here, then it doesn’t change anything.”
“How’s it not change nothin’? How’s findin’ a dead body not put a notch in your bow?”
“Because I’m a man of resolve, Seb. I go until the goings no good.”
“You don’t even know for sure that there’s a Mazid out there in that desert. Could be only merchants and we come out here for nothin’.”
“If it’s only merchants, then we knock off a few fat bellies and we get a little richer. What’s the problem?”
“Could be that those aren’t merchants, but a bunch of Hrkan Skulsi in disguise.”
“A few soldiers won’t change the balance.”
“What if it’s more'n a few?”
“Then we’ll kill more than a few.”
“And how many is that?”
Moto sighed and pulled a small, red leather purse out from the belly of his robe. Seb’s eyes went wide at sight of it, for inside that pouch was a ribbon of black silk, and folded inside that silk were two smooth rock crystal lenses set inside thick brass rings. These rings were joined together by a dangling chain that, when stretched, was the length of Moto’s forearm. Seb always itched to try out those lenses, but Moto never let her touch them. Seb hated Moto for that. If those two lenses, set in array, could magnify the distance and make the horizon seeable, well, Seb wanted to have a look.
Moto sat down on the edge of the cliff and propped his elbow up on one knee and let his other leg dangle free. He hunched over, put the smaller lens up to his eye, then stretched out the other lens as far the chain would let, and began his squinting study of the distant blur.
Seb didn’t appreciate Moto sitting that way. It wasn’t just the lenses, it was the casual disregard for what Seb was capable of doing. In a flash, Seb could be right behind the man and push him off the cliff. Seb could end him right there. For all of Moto’s strength and skill with a sword, Seb could end him here. There were plenty of moments like this when Seb could do it. Could do it while Moto slept. While he ate. Seb had half a mind to do it right now.
Moto said, “I count fifty-four of them. Give or take.”
“Fifty-four’s more’n a few,” said Seb.
“And fifty-four is exactly how many Elrahet said there’d be—though there is an odd fix about them.”
“An odd fix?”
Moto squinted again. He was having trouble keeping his quarry in focus.
“It’s like they’re…well…they’re a standard caravan guard, but it looks like they’re marching in squares.”
Seb didn’t know much, but she knew one thing for certain—Moto’s expectations were getting in the way of the truth. And there was one other thing she knew for certain. “There ain’t no caravan guard that keeps in squares,” she said.
“That’s why I say it’s an odd fix.”
“It’s an odd fix ‘cause they ain’t no caravan guard. They’re real fighting men. Elrahet was wrong.”
“Eight wagons, too. That exactly matches her premonitions.” 
Seb screwed up her face in thought. Eight wagons was several more than the average merchant train. Predicted, maybe, but a merchant guard marching in tight formation? Caravan hands in this part of the Sand were ragged bands of backwash from Hrkan conquests, not the kind to march in squares.
Those men out there were Skulsi, Seb was sure. Fifty-four Skulsi and a god-damned Mazid were bearing down on them. And how many more men might be hiding in those wagons? Thirty?
Seb compared all this to what the Ayramun brought to bear—forty-three bows. Forty-three bows and Ayram. And old Elrahet. Against anyone else she liked the odds, but nobody tangled with the Mazidai with good reason—the fire those slaves hid in their stomachs could wipe out entire armies.
But the Junei hills were a decent place to bushwhack a column of Hrks. Everywhere the slopes were steep, and no matter which particular route was taken into the pass there were places where strong shoulders would have a clean shot at the whole enemy column—that’s assuming the whole column was dumb and tried to stuff through all at once. Skulsi weren’t dumb. Against fearful men, an ambush here would be a slaughter. Against experienced warriors, Seb was not so sure. Add a Mazid…well if the Mazid was caught unawares...maybe the odds were three to one against. And that’s assuming the Mazid got taken down early and without too much trouble. 
 “I’d take them for Skulsi,” Moto said, “But even from here you can see they’re wearing that stingy brown wool of blackwood guards.”
“Could be common hands,” Seb replied.
“It could be.”
“Also could be those are Hrkan troops.”
“But they’re wrapped in brown wool.”
“So? A man can change his clothes.”
“A Skulsi doesn’t drop his whites for convenience, not even for subterfuge. It’d be a black mark.”
“The Sand makes converts of us all.”
Moto let go of his lens and watched them dangle on their chain. “Pride,” Moto noted through a plaintive sigh, “Is the only thing a Skulsi has. Once a soldier earns the whites, he’s not going to take them off for anything.” He paused. A subtle frown played on his lips. “Still, even if they’re wearing brown, they could be fighting men.”
“So they could be rabble, and they could be Skulsi.” 
“Skulsi won’t run when the killing starts.”
Seb nodded, and added, “And the way we’re set up—”
“I know. This only works if they try to run. But this is a game of risk. In the end, this is a Mazid we’re trying to catch. The Skulsi hardly matter.” 
“Then it’s decided,” Seb said. “It’s off.”
“That’s not for you to call, Seb. Sol’s light knows you’d be the last person allowed to make that call.”
“You ain’t shit either.”
“That’s where you’re wrong. Ayram put me in charge.”
Moto stood back up to make sure Seb got the full measure of him. “And like it or not, this is the only opportunity we’ll have to catch us a Mazid and its Minder. Elrahet being wrong about who they’re marching with isn’t enough to call this off.”
“What about the bones?”
“What about them?”
“If this don’t work out, an’ Ayram finds out there’s a dead body you didn’t let him know about it, then I’m blamin’ you. It’ll be your fault—your fault.”
“Yes, that’s how responsibility works.”
Moto then pinched a flat stone finger whistle between his lips and whistled the song of the Jek Tresset to let the Ayramun hidden in the valleys below know that the ambush was on. He stabbed and fluttered the high notes to encourage haste. Twittered replies sprang up from the hills below, and then, without so much as a parting nod, Moto set off down the path that led into that maze of mounded clay and rock.
Seb had different ideas about what she needed to do. She was going to run off to Elrahet’s cave, for the old witch was soon to conjure a blanket of fog the likes of which the Junei hills hadn’t seen for an age—a nice impenetrable fog to lay cover for the ambush, and damn it all if Seb didn’t get to watch how she did it.
Elrahet, Seb had learned, was difficult to track on account of the woman’s witchy senses. She couldn’t be followed. Seb only knew where her cave was because she’d scouted for it the night before—it was a thin crack in the base of a giant sloping slab of granite that constituted the greater part of a mountain peak. It was a bit of a climb to get to it. How Elrahet managed it, Seb had no idea.
When she made it to the cave crack, she could hear Elrahet’s faint mumblings echoing out. She shuffled inside and saw the old witch squatting over the corpse of a sizable black-backed lizard, both of them illuminated by a shaft of bluish light which poured down from a hole in the ceiling.
The lizard was belly up, and Elrahet’s fingers were already knuckle deep in its guts. Her arm twisted and twirled, and her lips whispered incantations as her upturned eyes searched the blue sliver of midday sky that peeked through the crack in the rock above.
Then she turned and set her dark eyes on Seb.
Seb stumbled backwards in fright and bumped her head on a rock and howled in pain.
“Damn!”
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, then she set her eyes back on the sky, and put her hand to work again in the lizard’s corpse.
She lowered her voice to a whisper
Seb strained to hear her garbled words.
“Em bestet buguul.”
When the words were echoed and gone, Elrahet looked down at her handiwork and said, “Em bestet shemuul.” 
She pushed down hard with her palm to squeeze the last meal out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Shefre gor, amkukre dor.” 
Her knotted fingers kneaded the intestines. 
“Shefre gor, zomgagor.”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up into the air and croaked, “We would be dust without it!” 
She dropped the entrails back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within.
Seb waited with bated breath for a sight of a Spark, or some effervescent swirl of glowing smoke, or anything, but nothing happened.
Elrahet snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s white belly wider. Into this gaping hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, and with it she pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin. The lizard’s belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Its gummy tongue popped out of its shovel mouth, and right when Seb supposed that the thing had come back to life,  Elrahet pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh.
“It is possible,” she said in a whisper loud enough for Seb to hear, “that the beast is infertile.”
Seb ventured nearer.
“This won’t work?” she asked as he knelt across from the witch.
“Not with this beast.”
Seb poked the lizard’s corpse with a curious finger. She could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-gray intestines inside writhed and pulsed like a twisted mass of worms.
“What are you gonna do?” she asked.
Elrahet hissed at her impudence, then said, “I need a fertile stomach.”
She looked at Seb’s stomach.
“Fresh blood from a fertile stomach,” she said.
Seb’s skin went cold at the insinuation.
“You are right here, in my cave, during my time of need. Did Solraheen provide you to me without my seeking?”
“My blood’s no good.”
“Quit your bellyaching and give me your arm.”
“My arm?”
“Your arm.”
“Thought you were gonna cut my stomach. How much blood you need?”
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given, least of all for magic. There’s no telling what a witch might do with it. But this was a golden chance to get in with the witch, and Seb had to take it. She studied Elrahet’s countenance to gauge her sincerity. Even in direct light, the difference between Elrahet’s smile and her frown was almost imperceptible under her sneer. It was common belief amongst the Ayramun that Elrahet never smiled at all, but Seb knew that wasn’t true. She’d seen her smile. She knew what it looked like. Elrahet wasn’t smiling now. 
“Your arm,” Elrahet said.
Seb rolled up her sleeve and extended her arm. Elrahet grabbed her wrist and Seb nearly wretched because Elrahet’s fingers were still dripping with the lizard’s blood, and she also didn’t care for the way Elrahet seemed to relish the sight of her veins bulging under her brown skin. And she didn’t like the way Elrahet smiled as she felt Seb shudder in her grip. Yes, she smiled. It caught Seb off-guard, for it was more than a crick in the corner of the lip, it was a full-on, nearly toothless grin.
Seb asked again, with more than a hint of unease, “How much do you need?” 
Elrahet’s smile faded and that mess of aged lines settled back into her familiar sneer. She pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from out of the shadows beside her and laid them between herself and Seb. Then she unsheathed a thin, curved golden knife from some hidden compartment in her robes and held its curve length-wise along Seb’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said, without affection.
“Do it.” 
Elrahet savored the lack of courtesy, then pricked her dagger’s tip into Seb’s flesh and flicked her wrist with expert care to open the vein. Seb remained stoic through the sting but she watched with grave concern as blood streamed out of the wound and ran around her wrist and over Elrahet’s knuckles as it flowed steadily down into the bowl.
After what seemed an eternity, she jerked her arm free. 
“That’s it,” she said firmly, and she held her hand up and pinched the wound closed with her thumb.
“Your gift is humbling,” said Elrahet, “But the bowl is half-full.”
“That should be enough.”
“Is it?”
“A poor witch blames her tools.”
Elrahet scowled. “Who told you that?”
“You’re not the only witch I’ve known.”
Elrahet grumbled as if she were about to bark and bite. 
Seb backed away.
When next Elrahet spoke her voice was thick with contempt. 
“Think worse of where you sit on the scales of mercy. I could have your stomach for a bag.”
She tossed the scrap of linen at Seb’s face and shooed her out with a flick of her finger.
Seb cursed herself yet again, because not only did she spoil whatever goodwill she thought she’d earned, but she’d let Elrahet prick the wrong wrist, her pulling wrist. Every pull of the bowstring in the coming ambush would bring a twinge of pain. </Text>

            <Text>
This was an area where, as at wadi kubbaniya, foragers relied heavily on seasonally flooded embayents, places where catfish and tilapia  gathered and dense mats of purple nut grass grew.

Jarawa were ambushed so often that, though they usually went around naked, they took to wearing bark armor to ward off arrows.
Ambushes of this kind are too small-scale to be considered war, but they can be nasty, and once begun they can turn into blood feuds that can last for years. While blood feuds tend to arise with clans, there are exceptions to this rule of thumb. In areas of rich resources like those of the tropical Andaman Islands, described later, even clanless foragers could “afford to make enemies of their neighbors,” as Kelly puts it. In the case of Jebel Sahaba, however, we believe that we are dealing with societies with clans. One reason is that the site was a cemetery.


Aborigines did not believe there was such a thing as inevitable natural death. Death resulted either from homicide or witchcraft.

Cooking sedge bulbs in hot ashes.

While many tribes had enemies for neighbors, there was one person who could travel widely without fear of death: the sacred messenger. The messenger might, for example, be carrying the red-painted forearm bone of a deceased relative,. Owing to his sacred mission, the meessenger could not be harmed. 

Andaman girl wearing her sisters skull like a backpack.

Because the Aka-Bea and Jarawa spoke different dialects, it was difficult for them to hold peacemaking ceremonies. In areas where there was no such language barrier, the Islanders did negotiate truces. 

Examples of overkill were frequent. A middle-aged man, Burial 21, had been hit with 19 flints; projectiles were found in the top of his pelvis, his forearm, his lower leg, his rib cage, and the base of his neck. One young woman, Burial 44, had been hit with 21 flints; three of these were probably the barbs of a spear that penetrated her face and reached the base of her skull. Nor were children spared. Two youngsters interred together, Burials 13 and 14, had flints in their neck vertebrae, each probably representing a coup de grâce.

            <Text>The only real option back then was to endure the smell. This is not to say that he got accustomed to it.

, and Mandri closed them again as soon as he realized what was happening. He didn’t want to see the afterlife until he’d properly prepared for it. 
When he finally opened his eyes again

It didn’t quite match his expectations. Shis was said to be a giant pit under the earth which housed a city of demons, and in its center was a mountain-sized tornado of fire that swept up the dead and raked their flailing bodies against white-hot spikes of iron embedded in the pit’s walls. Somehow, this process cleansed an individual’s Spark of any impurities. There were other, less popular, visions of Shis. There was one fresco in the city of Frum which matched the present environ neatly. In this version of Shis, the dead are sequestered away deep underground in bubbles of rock. Those who repent of their sins are free to waste away, while those whose sins are too great to be forgiven suffer a different fate. Their caves become cocoons in which their tainted Sparks morph their flesh into some species of demon.

“I’m not going to tell you my name,” said Mandri again, and that was final.
“Then I will make up a name for you.”
“Go ahead.”
“I shall call you Chit.”
“Chit?”
“You look like a Chit.”
Mandri felt offended. He was no Chit.
Obo said, “Mothers who love their sons a certain way tend to name them Chit. Chitavar. Chitavareen. They leave the boys too long on the tit. It makes the child all pouty. They all have that mousey look you have.”
Obo waved a bloody arm in Mandri’s general direction, as if Mandri was the very embodiment of ‘mousey’.
“Whatever you say, demon.”
“And you’re so sure that I’m a demon. That’s the unfounded certainty that’s so typical of a Chit. Or maybe that’s more of a Lurk. Is your name Lurk?”

“Tell me, Chit, why do you think everyone down here is a demon?”


“And how do I know you’re not lying? How do I know you aren’t a demon, and that the snore outside isn’t a demon. The only thing I do know is that I died. I know that I died. Then I wake up in a cave filled with black lizards and a freak—you expect me to believe that this is not some hollow of Shis?”
“Where did you die?”
“What does that matter?”
“Just answer.”
“I died in the Meskalem.”
“That’s close enough to the Junei Pass.”
“Why does that matter?”
“Because the Junei Pass is close enough to the Pitted Portion, and these lizards, as far as I know, only live in the pitted portion. They sleep half the year and then they wiggle out of the ground when packberry blooms, and only when packberry blooms, and packberry only grows in the Pitted Portion. These fellows aren’t opportunistic feeders.”
“What’s your point?”
“You died in Meskalem, and your body is still fresh so you couldn’t have been dead long, meaning your corpse couldn’t have been carried far. Then you wake up in an underground cave infested with these rumpheads—that’s what the lizards called. It stands to reason that you are not in Shis, that you are, indeed, inside a cave which pocks the Pitted Portion.”

There is some resemblance in physical form, but beyond that, I can assure you, the only thing we truly have in common is the capacity for language.

            <Text>The target of the first leg of their journey was a clump of hills set in the distant east. Those hills, Moteah remarked, those bluish lumps hiding in the morning haze, were called the Dune Hills. Mandri asked why they weren’t simply called dunes, and Moteah said because they weren’t dunes. She added that at a pilgrim’s pace it’d be a whole day’s journey from their current position. The Ayramun did not march at a pilgrim’s pace.
Seb charged ahead in front of them all with the grim determination of a man who wanted it all over with as soon as possible. He never talked, and he never looked up from the spot of ground a few feet in front of him. He simply marched. When everyone else took a pause to water, he did not stop. Soon he was a few miles ahead, a brown poke sticking out of a sea of heat and sand. He never once looked back, and nobody called out after him to wait.
Far behind him was Ayram, and giant as Ayram was his pack seemed too big for even him. Mandri could only see him from the calves down. And there was Ayram’s right arm, which metered out the miles with his iron spear casually thupping the ground.
Close behind Ayram, lagging like an eager pup, was Moto. Moto had come out of Minting Rock as if he were never there, for he’d taken pause to beat the dust off his bright orange robe. He’d even treated Mandri’s blood stain on the shoulder with a watery brown ointment that he kept in a blue corked bottle. His pack was much smaller. Mandri could see his head.
A few yards off Moto’s heels was Mandri. He took two steps for every one of Ayram’s, and every one of these steps was a struggle. It wasn’t so much the wound in his thigh as it was the soreness. His legs hadn’t recovered from being dead and from having spent the whole night walking. He tried to distract himself by stealing words from Ayram and Moto’s conversation. Moto had his own ideas about how to capture another Mazidariga, and when Moto had an idea, he’d engage his hands and shoulders to help express it. Ayram would grunt acknowledgment, and if Moto ever said something too ridiculous the words seemed to run an itch up Ayram’s spine and the man would have to readjust his pack, sending the web of rope holding it all together creakling under the strain.
Moteah, Purl, and Elrahet formed the rear. The younger women were making sure that Elrahet didn’t fall behind, though to Mandri’s eyes Elrahet didn’t look like she needed their help. She had set off from Minting Rock at a steady pace and had never wavered. 
“She has desert legs”, is what Moto said when Mandri asked about it. Mandri didn’t know what ‘desert legs’ meant until that afternoon, after they’d crossed a good chunk of the distance and the red sand gave way to a softer, deeper pink sand. His foot would sink with every step, and that set his calves to burning. He wanted to stop walking, sit down, and massage the muscles, but how could he when Elrahet would pass him by? Every time he glanced behind, Elrahet was there, a waddling blotch of black rags propped up by her cane, threatening to make him look a weakling.
But he was a weakling. He knew it, everyone else knew it, so he didn’t know why he was soldiering through it. And it’d be at least eight more days of this—eight more days of Obo’s weight screwing a knot into his lower back. And because Mandri’s shoulders were nothing but a gormless strip of muscle lounging atop his shoulder blades and collarbone, the litter’s thin straps bit right down through them to bruise the actual bones. Mandri kept trying to shift the straps around, to try and distribute the pain, but after a while, every spot along his shoulders were tender.
The only grace given to him was the sight of the rising sun. The pink sand all around him brightened the blush of dawn such that he felt that he was swimming in it. It was a scene worth painting. He knew it wasn’t possible to capture it, but he couldn’t stop himself from thinking about it.
“God, this hurts,” he moaned. By now he’d used up every joint in his fingers to take the weight of the straps, and every fingernail was throbbing.
“You’ll find your legs in a couple of days,” Moto said over the annoying rattle of his pack. “We’re almost to the hills.”
The Sand Hills loomed large a few hundred yards away. Mandri was worried Ayram wouldn’t stop when they got there, for the heat hadn’t yet become unreasonable, and he supposed Ayram would want to squeeze effort out of every finger. Seb had already crested one hill and disappeared behind it—if they were meant to stop, surely he’d wait at the peak.
It turned out that the Dune Hills were aptly named—half clay and rock, and half sand. They weren’t sandy enough to be considered full-fledged dunes, but there was too much sand whipping about to not consider them such. They were steep, the tallest ones were a good four times Ayram’s height, and their slopes were pocked by smooth black boulders that looked like they were bleeding rust. There wasn’t a single sign of life anywhere, plant or animal.
Thankfully, there were plenty of gaps and valleys which Ayram seemed to know. To Mandri it was a confusing web in which every slip face looked exactly like every other, and all of it looked ready to collapse down on him if the earth were to give the slightest shiver. Ayram, confident as ever, led them through this maze until they came upon a shallow, sandy pan, in the center of which was the smallest temple in the world.
It was the quaintest thing, a single circular room with sand-blasted walls of rough-hewn sandstone bricks. It had a domed roof of baked clay, and set atop its center was a vertical pole of petrified wood, tipped by a coronal splay of twigs—an Old Jandri piece which signifies a sacred place.
There wouldn’t be enough room inside for all of them to shelter from the creeping sun. If they tried it would be standing room only, and Ayram’s scalp would scrape against the ceiling. Still, it was their destination, and as they approached, a swarthy man popped out of the building’s shadow, bearing a self-satisfied grin. It was Seb.
“Took you long enough,” he said.
Ayram dumped his large pack next to the little temple’s entrance, and everyone else did the same, though Mandri was a little gentler with his own. With his shoulders and back relieved of their burden, he peered into the temple’s dark interior and hoped he’d find a chair.
“We should keep going,” Moto said.
No one agreed. Elrahet waddled straight into the temple, and Purl followed.
“We’re on a good pace,” Ayram said.
“But we’re only a day out from Minting Rock.”
“And I’m four days out from solid sleep,” Ayram said. He then picked up his monstrous bag, wrangled it through the temple’s threshold, and ducked in behind it.
With Elrahet, Purl, Ayram, and Ayram’s bag stuffed inside, there’d hardly be enough room for one more, so Mandri, being considerate, offered the position to himself. He rushed towards the entrance, stuck his head inside, and was surprised to find it empty save for a hole in the middle of a black-brick floor. It was a perfectly circular hole. Below it, a firelight flickered out of sight. Ayram and the others were setting up a camp inside.
Seb pushed on Mandri’s back and said, “Hurry it up.”
“What is this place?” 
“It’s a hole in the ground. Now move it.”
The ground below the hole didn’t look too far away, maybe as far as Mandri was tall, so he jumped down into it.
His ankles were the first things to realize that the ground was much further away than he imagined. He hit the dirt hard and his tired legs crumpled against the impact. He fell forward, and the rest of him thumped against the ground like a sack of potatoes.
Seb’s voice came from raining down from up above, “You know there’s a ladder, right?”
Mandri rolled over and saw a firm wooden ladder standing there, taunting him. He was too tired to feel any kind of embarrassment, though that didn’t stop Seb from cackling as he descended down to Mandri’s level. Seb’s boots hit the floor, then he stood over Mandri and said, “I know exactly what you need.”
“I need rest,” Mandri grumbled.
“Yes, yes—that too.”
The room was a near-natural cave in the shape of an egg, with only a little bit of work elbowed into the floor to flatten and smooth it out. The wall behind the ladder opened up into a tunnel which ran farther out than Purl’s stick-and-tinder campfire flame could reach. Mandri didn’t care to ask where that tunnel led, all that mattered was that he was tired and there was enough room here to lay down. Ayram had already spread himself out, laying against his pack, arms folded, eyes closed, trying to will himself asleep.
Mandri maneuvered himself nearer the dark tunnel, for there the air was cooler. He sat down, gingerly, and claimed a spot of floor for himself. By the time Moto and Moteah wandered down the ladder, he was dreaming of burgeons and beer.
The first thing to wake Mandri up was Obo. Someone had brought Obo down the ladder and placed him next to Mandri. When Obo saw Mandri looking, he whispered, “Only two-hundred thousand steps to go.”
“What?” 
“There’s two-hundred thousand more steps until Bullr, roughly speaking.”
“Oh,” Mandri said as he closed his eyes again. Then he wondered aloud, “How many have we done already?”
“About twenty-thousand.”
“How do you know?” Mandri asked, already half asleep.
“There wasn’t much else to do but count.”
The second thing to awaken him was a feverish sweat. It was dark, for the meager fire had burned itself down to a tumble of coals, and almost none of the daylight outside made it into the hole in the ceiling. All was dark and cold, and yet, Mandri was burning up, drenched in sweat.
He sat up and fanned his robe against his tingling skin, and didn’t lay down again until he made peace with the fact that he wasn’t going to feel better. His legs ached, his back was sore, his shoulders were shredded, and he didn’t know how bad his feet had had it until he unwrapped his shoes to find that his heels were working up blisters. From then on, what sleep he managed to get came in fits and spurts, a few minutes here and there, and then he’d wake up sweating again. This back and forth sent his mind into a state of delirium, such that when Seb whispered out his name he was unsure if it were a dream.
“Mandri? You awake?”
 Mandri opened his eyes and all he saw was a shadow hovering over him. He knew it was Seb from the smell.
“Everything hurts,” Mandri groaned.
Seb leaned nearer still until he was whispering above Mandri’s ear.
“I know what you need. What you need is burgeons.”
Mandri’s ears perked up.
“You have burgeons?”
“Shhhhh,” Seb hushed. “Not so loud.”
The next thing Mandri knew he was following Seb’s faint footfalls into the darkness of the tunnel.
Mandri supposed they’d bumble around a bend or two so they wouldn’t have to whisper as they bit into the burgeons, but Seb kept going, and going, and every now and then they had to stumble down a flight of steps—never up, always down.
“Where are we going?” Mandri asked. His voice sounded strangely close to himself in the darkness, as if he were speaking directly into his own ear.
“I’ve already set up a fire, right up ahead.”
Mandri followed Seb around one more turn, then down a hall, and they stepped into a fire-lit room.
This room was a dome of natural stone with thin spikes of rock dripping down from the ceiling. On the opposite wall, there was what looked like an entrance to a cave. In the middle of the floor was a fire, and next to it, there was a chair.
A cushioned chair.
Mandri couldn’t believe his eyes. A thin, square, blackwood framed chair with a seat of suspended red cloth and a back to match with a red pillow sitting atop the seat.
Seb was walking towards it. Soon he had his hand on the skinny armrest. Such a man did not deserve to sit in such a chair.
Mandri said, “Could I sit in that chair?”
Seb sat down in it proudly and said, “My burgeons, my chair.”
There was nothing else to sit on. The room was empty and chalky white except for soot staining the ceiling. Mandri sat cross-legged on the floor next to Seb and he huddled closer to the fire. It was much colder down here than up above.
“Already sore?” Seb asked.
“I’m past sore. I’m broken.”
“Remind me to give you some spines tomorrow. I’ve got plenty.”
“They help with soreness?”
Seb leaned back in his chair and fished a green thorn out his robe’s pocket.
“You chew ‘em, an it keeps you alert. But it’s more than that. The juices work the bitch right out of you.”
Seb popped the borcandi spine into his mouth and got to chewing. The first few chomps were accompanied by a horrible crunchy squelch, like he was biting down on a beetle.
“You don’t have the jaw for ‘em,” Seb said. “Look at that jaw. You got a woman’s jaw.”
“Well, my diet consists mostly of burgeons.”
“I bet if I made a flute outta your bones it’d sound like a hollerin’ bitch.”
Mandri sat still. He’d bear any insult if there was a burgeon at the end of it.
Seb reached back into his robe. He fished around for a moment more and pulled out a leather pouch. He dangled this pouch around in the firelight, and Mandri tried not to look too impressed. 
“So, you a burgeon man?” Seb asked.
“Burgeons are the only thing that make life worthwhile.”
“Then you’re in luck. Look at what I got here.”
Seb reached into the pouch with two dirty fingers to pinched the stem of a burgeon. What he pulled out was the most beautiful burgeon that Mandri had ever seen.
“What is that?”
“We call it God’s Eye.”
Mandri marveled at it.
The most beautiful of all possible burgeons.
What a burgeon is, in short, is an intermediate stage between a flower and a fruit. Only burgeon bushes go through it. The final fruit looks something like a melted cluster of berries, with seeds dotting every pit. The burgeon itself is a plump capsule of hardened leaves, not too dissimilar to the more familiar flower bud.
The best way to grow burgeons is to shield them from the rain and drip-feed them on a careful schedule via irrigation ditch. This stresses the plant, and for some reason, the stress causes it to put out more flowers. Mandri always believed that this was a spiritually significant fact, a clear and direct example of how suffering leads one to bear richer fruit. It was one of creation’s themes to be studied right next to the notion that Solraheen creates things which create themselves. Of course, the plant can’t deal with too much suffering. Withhold all the water and the burgeons never come out at all. The suffering has to be planned out far in advance, measured and applied by an experienced torturer. A daily regimen of sufferings, precisely applied, and as Solraheen makes holy men so too can man create plump and juicy burgeons. These Gods Eye burgeons were so plump and so juicy that they must be akin to saints.
“Where’d you find those?” Mandri asked.
Seb let the burgeon roll around in his palm to let the light play on its iridescent exterior. “Beautiful, ain’t it?”
Mandri reached out to touch it but Seb quickly clutched it away. “You think I’d give it for free?”
“I don’t have anything to give you,” Mandri said. “I’m not going to suckle your toes or anything.”
“You got a dirty mind.”
“I was joking.”
Seb leaned forward in his chair to wag his finger right at Mandri’s nose.
“I know what they get up to in the cities,” he said. “It’s one sin after the next. One ill Spark corrupts all the others. That’s why people got to keep separate.”
Seb relaxed back into the chair and continued to admire the burgeon.
“What are we doing down here?” Mandri asked. “Why couldn’t we just eat the burgeons back up there?”
“Ayram don’t much appreciate burgeons. Liable to slit our throats if he gets a whiff.”
“Really?” Mandri said, eyes going wide.
“He wouldn’t actually slit our throats,” he said. “He’d be disappointed, is all.”
“I don’t want to be on Ayram’s bad side.”
“Ayram’s only got the one side. Ayram is Ayram. Nothing else.”
Mandri nodded like he understood, and to this, Seb gave a satisfied smile, like he’d just communicate some sage wisdom.
“Now,” he said, “How do you like your burgeons?”
“Any way I can get them.”
Seb scoffed, and licked his lips like he was about to say something mean, but he stopped himself.
“You’re like that Mazid,” he said. “Never can answer a question straight. Bet you would try to outwit a fart.”
“Seb, I honestly don't care—whatever you want to do to that burgeon, I will consume it. Crushed, boiled, stewed, crumbled in eggs, dripped over bacon, pressed into beer…”
“If you had to choose.”
“Well, one time I made a burgeon tea and boofed it.”
“Boofed it?”
“Poured it into my ass.”
Seb’s face screwed up as he confronted the mental image. Mandri hadn’t ever actually done this, but he loved the way the thought of it tortured Seb.
Mandri said, “That’s what I thought too until I tried it. You only need, like, a quarter of the usual amount to get the same effect if you boof it.”
“City folk,” Seb muttered, disapprovingly.
“Solraheen didn’t put a second mouth inside my butt for no reason. You ever think of it like that? I mean, if I were designing human beings, I wouldn’t mix the piping up like that, but it is what it is. It’s like you say, if He didn’t want it to happen, it wouldn’t have happened.”
Seb’s frown grew ever-deeper. He couldn’t say anything because the logic was structurally sound—it was what it was because of how it was.
Mandri said, “Think about it like this, we’re still nine days out from Bullr, and how long are those burgeons going to last us?”
“Us?” Seb asked accusingly.
“Well, okay, fine, how long will they last you?”
“This is God’s Eye, boy. It don’t take much to split open a stomach. Half a sliver off the stem would do it—even if you been accustomed.”
Seb pulled his long dagger from his waistband.
“Hold out your hand,” he said.
“Why?”
“Hold it out.”
Sane people don’t give their hands to a grungy man in a cave while that man is holding a blade. Mandri, lured by the promise of a God’s Eye burgeon, had no choice. He held out his hand.
Seb dropped that saintly burgeon into Mandri’s hand. It rolled around in his palm, and then settled onto his fingers. Seb then reached down and held the burgeon steady. His blade cut through as if it weren’t even there. Then Seb pulled away, pulled the burgeon away, and all that was left in Mandri’s hand was a few dewy drops of a cloudy pale-green sap.
“That’s it?” Mandri asked.
Seb held his blade out. Stuck to its edge was a thin sliver of burgeon. Mandri peeled it off, and then popped it in his mouth and swallowed it.
“The sap, too,” said Seb.
Mandri didn’t need encouragement to lick his fingers dry.
Then Seb whipped out a little glass vial, plopped the bleeding burgeon into it, and tucked it away.
“You aren’t having any?” Mandri asked.
“Sometimes, folks get a bad reaction to God’s Eye. It’s best if I play Minder for a while.”
“I’ll be fine.”
“Don’t be sure.”
“I bet I’ve consumed more burgeons than any man alive.”
“Just sit back and watch the fire. We’ll know soon enough how you take to it.”
Mandri stared at the fire and waited for the burgeonsight to kick in. He was quite giddy, because God’s Eye burgeons should give him a god’s sight.
“How long is this going to take?” he asked.
“Depends on the person.”
“You know I wonder if the Mazidai are affected by burgeons.”
“They ain’t got Sparks.”
“I kinda want to give some to Obo and see what happens.”
“I won’t waste a good God’s Eye on no evil creature like a Mazid.”
“Evil?”
“Yes. Evil.”
“Doesn’t seem so evil to me.”
“Hah!”
“What?”
Seb gazed into the fire and said, “I seen a Mazid roast a child on a spit.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“I saw it with my own damn eyes. It ran an iron shaft the width of my arm right through the little boy’s throat and… and then two smaller ones to pin the arms and legs.”
Seb's cheeks went flush as talked. If his story weren’t true, he’d at least convinced himself that it was.
“Why would a Mazid do that?” Mandri asked.
“Who can say why evil does what it does?”
Mandri paused for a moment and pretended to think. He wanted to think of a good explanation for what Seb had seen, but the burgeon juice was starting to work its magic. The flames of the fire were starting to slow right down.
So he simply said, “Whatever.”
“Now hold on,” said Seb. “You do understand the Mazidai are evil, don’t you?”
“Yeah, sure, they’re evil.”
“Nah, nah, nah. You think that freak upstairs is good, don’t you!?”
Mandri’s lids were getting heavy. He said, speech blurred, “You say you’ve seen some things, I’ve seen other things, I mean I can only really go on what I’ve seen.”
“That Mazid would burn the world if he got the chance.”
Mandri shrugged his shoulders.
“Don’t shrug your shoulders at me.”
“Oh, come on,” Mandri said. “You know what they say…”
“What do they say?”
“There’s always…” his thoughts fluttered as the fire’s flames turned from orange to green. “There’s always two sides to every story.”
“Two sides? You shittin’ me? TWO sides!? What’s the other side to ten thousand folk gettin’ killed for runnin’ away? Cut ‘em right the fuck in half!”
“Ohhh, shit,” Mandri murmured as the world turned around him. He lay back on the ground to try and anchor himself. This had no effect.
“There’s a stright-down evil staring you in the face, and you can’t see it ‘cause of shome jrupin ol rashsifsh agrash suj…”
Mandri could no longer make sense of Seb’s words. The rock walls were folding around him, stretching past him, and when he looked up at the soot-stained ceiling he began to fall upwards into it, imperceptibly at first, but soon enough the rock zipped past in herks and jerks, then the black stained features of the ceiling began to congeal into a ceilingless abyss. 
This was nothing like burgeon-sight. This was nothing like reality at all. In a blink he’d been transformed into what seemed like pure movement—yes, he was nothing but movement, bursting, jolting up and down, no elegant smoothing in and out, no sense of natural timing that one normally associates with Sol’s creation. It was like he was being picked up by a god who liked to play with his food.
Mandri was still all there at this point. He knew, upon further consideration, that he was not ‘movement’, that this was all the work of the God’s Eye burgeon, and almost as soon as he set his mind to the task of bringing himself down he succeeded—he was back in the cavern room, laying on the floor, staring up at that soot-stained ceiling.
But that soot was dark, black as night. Black as Fabled Black. Suddenly he was lost again, lost to the burgeon. He stared, stupefied by the sight of a fibrous purple ooze seeping out of that ceiling black, swirling like ink. As it descended it’s color changed into a deep and suffocating red. It reached down and latched onto Mandri’s stomach, adhering to his skin, for he was now, suddenly, naked.
“Seb!?” Mandri called out, but there was no reply. He looked but there was only an empty chair. He tried to scream but the fibrous red had slithered up his chest and darted into his mouth. Next thing he knew, he was cocooned, and the red color filled his sight like a fog until all edges merged into each other and Mandri could not discern where he ended and the world outside began. He tried to hold focus, he tried to count and breathe, but his inability to do it only magnified the sensation of his mind’s disassembly. 
Beyond this point, Mandri could not construct a coherent sequence of events. There were shapes. Patterns. Eyes. Stasis and metastasis merged into an impossible third state of being. Reality collapsed. And so Mandri lay there like a newborn, wide-eyed, a sense-organ with no memory, aware only of his own presence.</Text>

            <Title>Misanthrope Obo</Title>
            <Text>There was the common thread to Obo’s now daily lectures—he didn’t think highly of humans. As the days wore on he talked more and more about what ridiculousness people got up to without the guiding light of governance.
He spoke of how, in the distant age of temple cities, there was an Old Jandri custom that forbade anyone from selling land. The purpose was good-natured, as the wise sages of those cities had enough history to know what causes a city’s collapse—wealth attracts wealth just as sand attracts sand, and inevitably the wealthiest end up with everything, all the money, and all of the land. Since the larger mass of people have nothing, they either leave or simply rebel. 
To combat this, the city sages decided to prevent the sale of land so that a family could persist for generations regardless of what the rich wolves were up to. They instituted a law stating that land could be had only through inheritance, that way fruitful land stays in the family, regardless of whether the family is rich or poor. If a childless couple found their work too heavy in their old age, they could adopt a few straight-backed persons to till their fields and reap the harvests, and these surrogate children could stand to inherit on the condition that they provided grain, oil, and clothes to their adoptive parents for as long as the old folks lived.
But the rich were too clever for it. Judges were bribed, councils were captured, and by hook or by crook they weaseled their way into the lines of succession. This practice carried on for more than one hundred years in the heart of Old Jandri. What began as a few rich, wicked schemers evolved into wicked consortiums of ‘sons’ who shared pools of silver and gold from which poor landowners were forced to turn to in times of drought, signing over the birthright of their trueborn children to the rich. Such was the depravity that a single man was once the adopted child of five-hundred and fifty-two different sets of parents. 
According to Obo, this was the birth of the Old Jandri banking system. The pretense of adoption was eventually shed, and more sophisticated systems of accumulation were devised. It wasn’t overthrown until the Hrks put a stop to it. Of course, the Hrks brought systems all their own, but the point illustrated how cutting through depravity requires someone to literally cut through it, else it will fester.</Text>

            <Text>It was the middle of night when they reached the end of the Tib. Mandri was so happy that he collapsed in prayer. Everyone was ecstatic—everyone but Ayram. His fretful eye studied the north.
“Looking for Hrks,” he said.
They might have made it out of the Tib, but they hadn’t made it out of danger. But their mood was good, and doubly so, because the eastern rim of the world was peaked with the red Goree mountains. Those mountains had arrived all at once, a long, dark lumpy line.
The Ayramun picked themselves up and quickened their pace, practically jogging along, for the Goree had no hills. The way to them was flat and iron-red, and it stayed that way all the way up to the mountain chain’s base. The mountains themselves were brilliant red buttresses against the desert wind, and as such their rock faces bore the scars of the wind’s assault—deep, erosive cuts swept up and over them.
Ayram led them south in line with these mountains, towards the Goree Pass.
Mandri asked Moteah how Ayram knew where they were relative to the Pass.
“He remembers it,” said Moteah, as if that were a perfectly adequate explanation. Mandri knew that Ayram couldn’t have dead-reckoned it all the way from that little desert temple. The featureless Tib would have made that impossible, and the arc of the sun was more of a guideline than a precise measure.
He considered asking the giant himself, but decided not to, and good thing too, because the next person who spoke drew Ayram’s ire.
It was Seb.
She had to poop.
Ayram shushed her, but Seb insisted.
“You’re the one that made me eat those flies!” Seb said.
“Alright!” Ayram exclaimed, and he stopped walking. “We’ll make a short camp here. Be quick and quiet.”
“It ain’t gonna be quiet, I can tell ya that. Ain’t gonna be quick, either.”
Seb sauntered off towards the mountains, and disappeared amongst the shadows of rocks.
Mandri dumped Obo onto the ground, then went to Moteah and asked for some twigs to make a fire to calm the night chill.
“No fires,” said Ayram. “We’ve got to be quiet, and we’ve got to pass unseen.”
Moto added. “If you don’t know, the Goree’s cursed. If that doesn’t get you, there’s two kinds of tribes in the Goree—those who want to kill you, and those who want to steal all your stuff. Either way, you end up dead.”
“Won’t they have seen us coming from miles away?”
“There’s not much reason for them to be watching the Tib, because it’s not a journey often made. We might have slipped through and if we have, we don’t want to spoil it with a fire.”
“Well, how close are we to the Pass?”
“We’ll be upon it by morning,” said Ayram.
“In the light of day?”
“Yes.”
“But you just said that everyone wants to kill us.”
“The Goree pass is protected by outland law, so long as you pass in the day.”
“And who enforces that law?” Obo asked.
“Custom.”
Obo laughed, and this drew a dirty look from Moto. Moto said,  “Custom may mean nothing to you, but desert custom demands respect amongst outland tribes. They preserved our peoples for thousands of years despite every attempt to eradicate us. Every tribesman knows that if they violate the truce of the Goree Pass, then they are dead.”
Obo said, with ebullient eyes, “I didn’t laugh because I doubted you. I laughed because I believed you.”
“Well, I don’t believe him,” said Mandri.
“But you should,” said Obo.
“Why? No desert custom is going to stop people from looking out for themselves.”
“Have you ever heard of the Tukli?” Obo asked.
“The who?”
“The Tukli lived in an alluvial plain just south of Cask. They had strange ways of worshiping Solraheen, so to incorporate them into the Hrkan world the Lords had to reform their religion. The plan was to do it piecemeal, over generations, so as not to cause a stir—don’t start with the religion itself, start with some of their customs to soften them up. The first thing we did is we told them to write Solraheen with one ‘h’ instead of two.”
“So?”
“Guess what they did.”
“They didn’t want to do it?”
“They built warehouses out of resin-rich timber, locked themselves inside, and then burnt it all down. An entire tribe of ten-thousand people killed themselves in one night. They killed themselves and their children over a single L. If you ever make it to Jeket’s library, you should look for a book on the histories of the Old Believers.”
“I’m not going to do that.”
“You should. The customs of Outland tribes are tickling.”
Elrahet had been sitting silently by herself, brooding as she’d been want to do since they’d entered the Tib. The next words she spoke were her first in several days. “You’re the Mazid that killed the Tukli?”
“Are you not listening?” said Obo. “They killed themselves.”
Elrahet turned her back and that was that.
Ayram said that was enough noise for the night, and they took up shelter behind a jumble of boulders which blocked the western wind. Ayram shared stern words with Seb when she got back from her fecal excursion. All save the giant lay down to rest.</Text>

            <Text>They walked through the night. The first real feature of the desert that Mandri saw was clump of bluish hills obscured by the morning haze. Those hills in the east, Moteah remarked, were called the Dune Hills. Mandri asked why they weren’t simply called dunes, and Moteah said they weren’t dunes. She added that at a pilgrim’s pace it’d be a whole day’s journey to reach them. The Ayramun did not march at a pilgrim’s pace.
Seb charged ahead in front of them all with the grim determination of a woman who wanted it all over with as soon as possible. She never talked, and she never looked up from the spot of ground a few feet in front of her. She simply marched. When everyone else took a pause to water, she did not stop. Soon she was a few miles ahead, a brown poke sticking out of a sea of rising heat and sand. She never once looked back, and nobody called out after her to wait.
Far behind her was Ayram, and giant as Ayram was, his pack seemed too big even for him. Mandri could only see him from the calves down. And there was Ayram’s right arm, which metered out the miles with his iron spear casually thupping the earth.
Close behind Ayram, lagging like an eager pup, was Moto. Moto had come out of Minting Rock as if he were never there, for he’d taken pause to beat the dust off his bright orange robe. He’d even removed the blood stain on the shoulder with a watery brown ointment that he kept in a blue corked bottle. His pack was much smaller. Mandri could see his head.
A few yards off Moto’s heels was Mandri. He took two steps for every one of Ayram’s, and every one of these steps was a struggle. It wasn’t so much the wound in his thigh as it was the general soreness. His legs still hadn’t recovered from being dead, and a whole night of hard walking had been rough. He tried to distract himself from the ache by listening in on Ayram and Moto’s conversations. Moto had ideas about capturing another Mazidariga after it had sucked out Obo’s pseudospark, and when Moto had an idea, he’d engage his hands and shoulders to help express it. Ayram would grunt acknowledgment, and when Moto suggested that they should try another Minting Rock, the ridiculousness ran an itch up Ayram’s spine and the giant readjusted his pack, sending the web of rope holding it all together creakling under the strain. This evidently meant no.
Moteah and Elrahet formed the rear. The younger woman was making sure that old Elrahet didn’t fall behind, though to Mandri’s eyes Elrahet didn’t look like she needed help. She had set off from Minting Rock at a steady pace and had never wavered. 
“She has desert legs,” is what Moto said when Mandri asked about it. Mandri didn’t know what ‘desert legs’ meant until that afternoon, after they’d crossed a good distance and the red sand gave way to a softer, deeper pink sand. His foot would sink with every step, and that set his calves to burning. He wanted to stop walking, sit down, and massage the muscles, but how could he when Elrahet would pass him by? Every time he glanced behind, Elrahet was there, a waddling blotch of black rags propped up by her cane, threatening to make him look a weakling.
But he was a weakling. He knew it, everyone knew it, so he didn’t know why he was soldiering through it. And it’d be at least eight more days of this—eight more days of Obo’s weight screwing a knot into his lower back. And because Mandri’s shrugging muscles were nothing but gormless strips lounging atop his shoulders, the litter’s thin straps bit right down through them to bruise the collarbones. Mandri kept trying to shift the straps around, to try and distribute the pain, but after a while, every spot along his shoulders was tender.
“Sol, this hurts,” he moaned. By now he’d used up every joint in his fingers to take the weight of the straps, and every fingernail was throbbing.
“You’ll find your legs in a couple of days,” Moto said over the annoying rattle of his pack. “We’re almost to the hills.”
The Dune Hills loomed large a few hundred yards away. Mandri was worried Ayram wouldn’t stop when they got there. The heat was unreasonable, but he supposed Ayram would want to squeeze effort out of every finger. Seb had already crested one hill and disappeared behind it—if they were meant to stop, surely she’d wait at the peak.
It turned out that the Dune Hills were aptly named—half clay and rock, and half sand. They weren’t sandy enough to be considered full-fledged dunes, but there was too much sand whipping about to not consider them such. They were steep, the tallest ones were a good four times Ayram’s height, and their pink slopes were pocked by smooth black boulders that looked like they were bleeding rust. There wasn’t a single sign of life anywhere, plant or animal.
They struggled up and over the first hill, but after that, there were plenty of gaps and valleys which Ayram seemed to know. To Mandri it was a confusing web in which every slip face looked exactly like every other, and all of it looked ready to collapse down on him if the earth were to give the slightest shiver. Ayram, confident as ever, led them through this maze until they came upon a shallow, sandy pan in the center of which was the smallest temple in all existence.
It was the quaintest thing, a single circular hut with sand-blasted walls of rough-hewn sandstone bricks. It had a domed roof of baked clay, and set atop its center was a vertical pole of petrified wood, tipped by a coronal splay of twigs—an Old Jandri piece which signifies a sacred place.
There wouldn’t be enough room inside for all of them to shelter from the afternoon sun. If they tried it would be standing room only, and Ayram’s scalp would scrape against the ceiling. Still, it was their destination, and as they approached, a swarthy woman popped out of the building’s shadow, bearing a self-satisfied grin. It was Seb.
“Took you long enough,” she said.
Ayram dumped his large pack next to the little temple’s entrance, and everyone else did the same, though Mandri was a little gentler with his own. With his shoulders and back relieved of their Mazid burden, he peered into the temple’s dark interior and hoped he’d find a chair.
“We should keep going,” Moto said.
No one agreed. Elrahet waddled straight into the temple, and Moteah followed.
“We’re on a good pace,” Ayram said.
“But we’re only a day out from Minting Rock.”
“I’m four days out from sleep,” said the giant. He then picked up his monstrous bag, wrangled it through the temple’s threshold, and ducked in behind it.
With Elrahet, Moteah, Ayram, and Ayram’s bag stuffed inside, there’d hardly be enough room for one more, so Mandri, being considerate, offered the position to himself. He rushed towards the entrance, stuck his head inside, and was surprised to find it empty. The explanation was there on the black brick floor—a hole. It was a perfectly circular hole. Mandri stepped inside the temple and peered down into this hole, where below, a firelight flickered into being. Ayram and the others were setting up camp inside.
Seb pushed on Mandri’s back. “Hurry up.”
“What is this place?” 
“It’s a hole. Now move it.”
The ground below the hole didn’t look too far away, maybe as far as Mandri was tall, so he jumped down into it. His ankles were the first things to realize that the ground was much further away than he imagined. He hit the dirt hard and his tired legs crumpled against the impact. He fell forward, and the rest of him thumped against the ground like a sack of beets.
Seb’s voice came from raining down from up above, “You know there’s a ladder, right?”
Mandri rolled over and saw a firm wooden ladder standing there, taunting him. He was too tired to feel any kind of embarrassment, though that didn’t stop Seb from cackling as she descended down to Mandri’s level. Her boots hit the floor, then she stood over Mandri and said, “I know exactly what you need.”
“I need rest,” Mandri grumbled.
“Yes, yes—that too.”
The room was a near-natural pear shaped cave, with only a little bit of work elbowed into the floor to flatten and smooth it out. The ladder ran right down the middle, and the wall beyond opened up into a tunnel which ran farther out than Moteah’s stick-and-tinder campfire flame could reach. Mandri didn’t care to ask where that tunnel led, all that mattered was that he was tired and there was enough room here to lay down. Ayram had already spread himself out, laying against his pack, eyes shut tight, hands clutching his folded arms, wrestling with sleep.
Mandri maneuvered himself nearer the dark tunnel, for there the air was cooler. He sat down, carefully, and claimed a spot of floor for himself. By the time Moto wandered down the ladder, he was dreaming of burgeons and beer.
The first thing to wake Mandri was Obo. Someone had brought Obo down the ladder and placed him next to Mandri. When Obo saw Mandri looking, the Mazid whispered, “Only two-hundred thousand steps to go.”
“What?” 
“There’s two-hundred thousand more steps until Bullr, roughly speaking.”
“Oh,” Mandri said as he closed his eyes again. Then he wondered aloud, “How many have we done already?”
“About twenty-thousand.”
“How do you know?” Mandri asked, already half asleep.
“There wasn’t much else to do but count.”
The second thing to awaken him was a feverish sweat. It was dark, for the meager fire had burned itself down to a tumble of coals, and the daylight outside was fading. All was dark and cold, and yet, Mandri was burning up, drenched in sweat.
He sat up and fanned his robe against his tingling skin, and didn’t lay down again until he made peace with the fact that he wasn’t going to feel better. His legs ached, his back was sore, his shoulders were shredded, and he didn’t know how bad his feet had suffered until he unwrapped his shoes to find that his heels were working up blisters. From then on, what sleep he managed to get came in fits and spurts, a few minutes here and there, and then he’d wake up sweating again. This back and forth sent his mind into a state of delirium, such that when Seb whispered out his name he was unsure if it were a dream.
“Mandri? You awake?”
 Mandri opened his eyes and all he saw was a shadow hovering over him. He knew it was Seb from the smell.
“Everything hurts,” Mandri groaned.
Seb leaned nearer still until she was whispering above Mandri’s ear.
“I know what you need. What you need is burgeons.”
Mandri’s ears perked up.
“You have burgeons?”
“Shhhhh,” Seb hushed. “Not so loud.”
The next thing Mandri knew he was following Seb’s faint footfalls into the darkness of the tunnel.
Mandri supposed they’d bumble around a bend or two so they wouldn’t have to whisper as they bit into the burgeons, but Seb kept going, and going, and every now and then they had to stumble down a flight of steps—never up, always down.
“Where are we going?” Mandri asked. His voice sounded strangely close to himself in the darkness, as if he were speaking directly into his own ear.
“I got a fire, up ahead.”
Mandri followed Seb around one more turn, then down a hall, and they stepped into a fire-lit room.
This room was a dome of natural stone with thin spikes of rock dripping down from the ceiling. In the middle of the floor was a fire, and next to it, there was a chair.
A blessed chair.
Mandri couldn’t believe his eyes. A skinny, square, blackwood chair with a seat of suspended red cloth and a back to match with a red pillow relaxing against a flat arm.
Seb was walking towards it. Soon she had her hand on the skinny armrest. Such a woman did not deserve to sit in such a chair.
Mandri asked, “Could I sit there?”
Seb sat down in it. “My burgeons, my chair.”
The rest of the room was empty and chalky white save for soot staining the ceiling. Mandri sat cross-legged on the floor next to Seb and he huddled closer to the fire. It was much colder down here than up above.
“Already sore?” Seb asked.
“I’m past sore. I’m broken.”
“Mind me to share you some spines tomorrow. I got plenty.”
“They help with soreness?”
Seb leaned back in her chair and fished a green thorn out her robe’s pocket. She eyed it as if it were a jewel.
“You chew ‘em, an it keeps you alert. But it’s more than that. The juices work the bitch right out of you.”
Seb popped the borcandi spine into her mouth and got to chewing. The first few chomps were accompanied by a horrible crunchy squelch, like she was biting down on a beetle.
“You don’t have the jaw for ‘em,” Seb said. “Look at that jaw. You got a woman’s jaw.”
“Well, my diet consists mostly of burgeons.”
“I bet if I made a flute outta your bones it’d sound like a widow wailin’.”
Mandri sat still. He’d bear any insult if there was a burgeon at the end of it.
Seb reached back into her robe. She fished around for a moment more and pulled out a leather pouch. She dangled this pouch around in the firelight, and Mandri tried not to look too impressed. 
“So, you a burgeon man?” Seb asked.
“Burgeons are the only thing that make life worthwhile.”
“Then you’re in luck. Look at what I got here.”
Seb reached into the pouch with two dirty fingers to pinched the stem of a burgeon. What she pulled out was stunning.
“What is that?”
“Call it God’s Eye.”
Mandri marveled at it. It was the most beautiful of all possible burgeons.
What a burgeon is, in short, is an intermediate stage between a flower and a fruit. Only burgeon bushes go through it. The final fruit looks something like a melted cluster of berries, with seeds dotting every pit. The burgeon itself is a plump capsule of hardened leaves, not too dissimilar to the more familiar flower bud.
The best way to grow burgeons is to shield them from the rain and drip-feed them on a careful schedule via irrigation ditch. This stresses the plant, and for some reason, the stress causes it to put out more flowers. Mandri always believed that this was a spiritually significant fact, a clear and direct example of how suffering leads one to bear richer fruit. It was one of creation’s themes. Of course, the plant can’t deal with too much suffering, not to the extent that Solitants might think is good for it. Withhold all the water and the burgeons never come out at all. The suffering has to be planned out far in advance, measured and applied by an experienced torturer. A daily regimen of sufferings, precisely applied, and as Solraheen makes holy men so too can men create plump and juicy burgeons. These God’s Eye burgeons were so plump and so juicy that they must be akin to saints.
“Where’d you find those?” Mandri asked.
Seb let the burgeon roll around in her palm to let the light play on its iridescent exterior, dark purples and blues. “Beautiful, ain’t it?”
Mandri reached out to touch it but Seb quickly clutched it away. “You think I’d give it for free?”
“I don’t have anything to give you,” Mandri said. “I’m not going to suck your toes or anything.”
“You got a dirty mind?”
“I was joking.”
Seb leaned forward in her chair to wag her finger right at Mandri’s nose.
“I know what they get up to in the cities,” she said. “It’s one sin after the next. One dark Spark corrupts all the others. That’s why people got to keep separate.”
Seb relaxed back into the chair and continued to admire the burgeon.
“What are we doing down here?” Mandri asked. “Why couldn’t we just eat the burgeons back up there?”
“Ayram don’t much appreciate burgeons. Liable to slit our throats if he gets a whiff.”
“Really?” Mandri said, eyes going wide.
“No. He’d be disappointed, is all.”
“Well, I don’t want to be on Ayram’s bad side.”
“Ayram’s only got the one side. Ayram is Ayram. Nothing else.”
Mandri nodded like he understood.
“Now,” she said, “How do you like your burgeons?”
“Any way I can get them.”
Seb scoffed, and licked her lips like she was about to say something mean, but she stopped herself.
“You’re like that Mazid,” she said. “Never can answer a question straight. Bet you would try to outwit a fart.”
“Seb, I honestly don't care—whatever you want to do to that burgeon, I will consume it. Crushed, boiled, stewed, crumbled in eggs, dripped over bacon, pressed into beer…”
“If you had to choose.”
“Well, one time I made a burgeon tea and boofed it.”
“Boofed it?”
“Poured it into my ass.”
Seb’s face screwed up as she confronted the mental image. Mandri hadn’t ever actually done this, but he loved the way the thought of it tortured Seb.
He said, “That’s what I thought too until I tried it. You only need, like, a quarter of the usual amount to get the same effect if you boof it.”
“City folk,” Seb muttered, disapprovingly.
“Hey, Solraheen didn’t put a second mouth inside our butts for no reason,” He was joking, but he kept going because of the tremendous frown Seb was wearing. “You ever think of it like that? If I were designing human beings, I wouldn’t mix the piping up like that, but it is what it is. It’s like you say, if He didn’t want it to happen, it wouldn’t have happened.”
Seb’s frown grew ever-deeper. She couldn’t say anything because the logic was structurally sound—it was what it was because of how it was.
“Think about it like this,” said Mandri. “We’re still nine days out from Bullr, and how long are those burgeons going to last us?”
“Us?” Seb asked accusingly.
“Well, okay, fine, how long will they last you?”
“This is God’s Eye, boy. It don’t take much to split open a stomach. Half a sliver off the stem would do it—even if you been accustomed.”
Seb pulled her long dagger from her waistband.
“Hold out your hand,” she said.
“Why?”
“Hold it out.”
Sane people don’t give their hands to a grungy knife-wielding woman in a cave. Mandri, lured by the promise of a God’s Eye burgeon, had no choice. He would have given his one good hand to a demon for the chance to taste that saintly burgeon.
Seb dropped it onto his palm. It rolled around, and then settled onto his fingers. 
“Hold still,” said Seb as she reached down and held the burgeon steady. Her blade cut through as if it weren’t even there, and when she pulled away, she pulled the burgeon away, and all that was left in Mandri’s hand was a few dewy drops of a cloudy pale-green sap.
“That’s it?” Mandri asked.
Seb held her blade out. Stuck to its edge was a thin sliver of burgeon. Mandri peeled it off, and then popped it in his mouth and swallowed it.
“The sap, too,” said Seb.
Mandri didn’t need encouragement to lick his fingers dry.
Then Seb whipped out a little glass vial, plopped the bleeding burgeon into it, and tucked it away.
“You aren’t having any?” Mandri asked.
“Sometimes, folks get a bad reaction to God’s Eye. It’s best if I play Minder for a while.”
“I’ll be fine.”
“Everyone says that.”
“I bet I’ve consumed more burgeons than any man alive.”
“Just sit back and watch the fire.”
Mandri stared at the fire and waited for the burgeonsight to kick in. He was quite giddy, because maybe a God’s Eye burgeon should give him a god’s eye sight.
“How long is this going to take?” he asked.
“Depends on the person.”
“You know, I wonder if the Mazidai are affected by burgeons.”
“They ain’t got Sparks.”
“I kinda want to give some to Obo and see what happens.”
“I won’t waste a good God’s Eye on no evil creature like a Mazid.”
“Evil?”
“Yes. Evil.”
“He doesn’t seem so evil to me.”
“Hah!”
“What?”
Seb gazed into the fire and said, “I seen a Mazid roast a child on a spit.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“I saw it with my own damn eyes,” she snarled. “It ran an iron shaft the width of my arm right through the little boy’s throat and… and then two smaller ones to pin the arms and legs.”
Seb's cheeks went flush as she talked. If her story weren’t true, she’d at least convinced himself that it was.
“Why would a Mazid do that?” Mandri asked.
“Who can say why evil does what it does?”
Mandri paused for a moment and tried to think. He tried to conjure a few excuses, but the burgeon juice was working its magic, for the flames of the fire were starting to slow right down.
He simply said, “Whatever.”
“Now hold on,” said Seb. “You do know the Mazidai are evil, don’t you?”
“Yeah, sure, they’re evil.”
“Nah, nah, nah. You think that freak upstairs is good, don’t you!?”
Mandri’s lids were getting heavy. He said, speech blurred, “You say you’ve seen some things. I’ve seen other things. I can only really go on what I’ve seen.”
“That Mazid would burn the world if he got the chance.”
Mandri shrugged his shoulders.
“Don’t shrug your shoulders at me.”
“Oh, come on,” Mandri said. “You know what they say…”
“What do they say?”
“There’s always…” his thoughts fluttered as the fire’s flames turned from orange to green. “There’s always two sides to every story.”
“Two sides? You shittin’ me? TWO sides!? What’s the other side to ten thousand folk gettin’ killed for runnin’ away? Cut ‘em right the fuck in half!”
“Ohhh, shit,” Mandri murmured as the world turned around him. He lay back on the ground to try and anchor himself. This had no effect.
Seb hovered over him.
“There’s a stright-down evil staring you in the face, and you can’t see it ‘cause of shome jrupin ol rashsifsh agrash suj…”
Mandri could no longer make sense of Seb’s words. The rock walls were folding around him, stretching past him, and when he looked past Seb at the soot-stained ceiling, he began to fall upwards into it, imperceptibly at first, but soon enough the rock zipped past in herks and jerks, then the black stained features of the ceiling began to congeal into a ceilingless void. 
This was nothing like burgeon-sight. This was nothing like reality at all. In a blink he’d been transformed into what seemed like pure movement—yes, he was nothing but movement, bursting, jolting up and down, no elegant smoothing in and out, no sense of natural timing. It was like he was being picked up by a god who liked to play with his food.
Mandri was still all there at this point. He knew that he was not ‘movement’, that this was all the work of the God’s Eye burgeon, and almost as soon as he set his mind to the task of bringing himself back down he succeeded—he was back in the cavern room, laying on the floor, staring up at that soot-stained ceiling.
But that soot was dark, black as night. Black as Fabled Black. And suddenly he was lost again, lost to the burgeon. He stared, stupefied by the sight of a fibrous purple ooze seeping out of that ceiling black, swirling like ink. As it descended it’s color changed into a deep and suffocating red. It reached down and latched onto Mandri’s stomach, adhering to his skin, for he was now, suddenly, naked.
“Seb!?” he called out, but there was no reply. He looked but there was only an empty chair. He tried to scream but the fibrous red had slithered up his chest and darted into his mouth. Next thing he knew, he was cocooned, and the red color filled his sight like a fog until all edges merged into each other and Mandri could not discern where he ended and the world outside began. He tried to hold focus, he tried to count and breathe, but his inability to do it only magnified the sensation of his mind’s disassembly. 
Beyond this point, Mandri could not construct a coherent sequence of events. There were shapes. Patterns. Eyes. Stasis and metastasis merged into an impossible third state of being. Reality collapsed. And so Mandri lay there like a newborn, wide-eyed, a sense-organ with no memory, aware only of his own presence.</Text>

            <Title>Dead Lizard</Title>
            <Text>The first object of note was the half-buried corpse of a large lizard, maybe half Mandri’s size. It was freshly dead from the storm, though it didn’t look like it, as most of its flesh had been stripped from the bone. What was left was being torn up by a small horde of flying beetles that looked like green jewels. Seb briefly stopped to collect as many of these beetles as she could. She offered one to Mandri, but Mandri declined.
Seb said, “They’re good chewin’, but I don’t got the teeth for ‘em anymore.” She proceeded to suck out the beetle’s innards through its rump like it were an oyster.
A few feet away from this dead lizard was a living one of the same species. Moteah called it a garool, and she said they slept unstirred under the sand for months until a rain came, and they’d wake up, mate, lay eggs, feast, then return to their quiescence. A charmed life, if not for the fact that this one’s partner was dead.</Text>

            <Title>Minting Rock</Title>
            <Text>Before the rise of the Hrks, the Fertile Portion was ruled by an Old Jandri king named Duror. To prove his dominion, Duror placed interlocking blocks of granite two-by-two-by-ten at every bend of the Jek river. Out of these gray columns he carved his long-bearded, long-robed, menacing image. The first statue was built at the Jek’s source, high up in the Goree mountains overlooking the Shoglok falls. This statue was sanded so smooth by the erosion of ages that no discernible feature of Duror remains. He is little more than a gray wither of stone in the general shape of a man, earless and eyeless, a brooding pillar that watches the sun, moon, and stars spin endlessly overhead.
The Jek river descends down into the foothills where it is guarded by a spate of statued Durors that are sanded smooth as well. They’re pointed pillars, more like cattle scratch posts than filigreed statues of a king. Their heads are conical nubs, their swords are worn down to the hilt, and reed boats float by them unbothered. Then the river pours out of the foothills and meanders down into the brink of Hrkan civilization. There the statues of Duror were somewhat shielded from the erosive wind, though they were not able to hide from the chisels of recriminate outland men. Once inside Hrk proper, their component blocks begin to disappear altogether as the stones are stolen to reinforce pastoral walls. When the river arrives at the outskirts of Jeket, all that is left of Duror’s monuments are the enormous plinths upon which they once stood, for they are too large for anyone to bother with.
Old Jandri statues disintegrate the nearer they come to Jeket—the symbolism here is obvious, unsubtle, and pointed, and so of course people disagree about what it means. A Hrkan Lord would say that it is a sign of Hrk’s cleansing influence on the old world, while outland folk see it as a sign of Hrk’s corrupting influence. Outland folk yearn for that storied age when all peoples were rootless, when herds of oxen were free to be chased across the entire continent, when women wove blankets so long they could be wrapped around a village, and when men were honest and would cut off their own fingers to prove that they were sorry.
Both sides, Hrkan and Outland, claim the statues of Duror as symbols of their own magnificence. Sometimes they kill over them. A bunch of nonsense, Mandri thought. Everyone involved was an idiot. The pivotal detail that no one cared to notice was that most of these statues were sitting alone out in an empty desert because the course of the river Jek had changed dramatically over the centuries. The statues have nothing to do with Hrk and whether it was good or bad. Their message is that nothing lasts forever, and while Mandri was sure about everything, he was most sure about that.
Rivers change their course.
Rivers dry up.
Continents dry up.
Everything living dies.
Solraheen Himself was killed and buried. 
Beauty fades.
Paintings brown up and curl.
Hands get cut off.
Statues turn to dust.
Everything living dies—that’s worth mentioning twice.
Ideas are easy to kill—some might try and argue that one, but Mandri could easily slip into saying that ideas are easy to corrupt, and no one could argue that.
Innocence is famously easy to kill. In fact, it seems that is the main function of innocence, to be killed.
Manhood is easy to kill because it doesn’t exist in the first place. Same with womanhood, adulthood, and any-hood. They’re all hoods foisted upon a child who never quite grows up. And children? Schisol knows children are easy to kill.
Minting Rock was another object to add to this collection of things consigned to oblivion. Its central sunlit well was drilled straight through the rock’s core and down a ways into the earth. Mandri was pulled up through it on a knotted rope by some out of sight Ayramun. He looked up as he ascended, for far above was a beautiful, canted column of light that split the blackness. He was smitten with that Spark-shushing awe which only comes from contact with a soon to be-extinguished culture.
It was impressive. He felt, without exaggeration, that he was inside the eye of a bead cast off from the necklace of a primordial mountain god. If it weren’t for the pain in his leg, and the difficulty in staying on the knot with only one hand and one effective foot, he would have had a spiritual experience.
He ascended into the first room, which was a bulbous, cylindrical cocoon eight men tall. The light above did little to illuminate the interior, it was lit instead by two flower-flame oil lamps affixed to either shoulder of a giant’s-height passage to Mandri’s left. It was a dim, splayed, orange light, and so much of the room’s detail was lost to blackness, but what Mandri could see took his breath away.
The flat disc of a floor was embossed with a rotationally symmetric diamond pattern, and at the floor’s edges this pattern ran smoothly up onto the wall, such that there was no distinction between where the floor ended and where the wall began. The pattern flowed upwards and split into several ribbons of sculptural stone, a weave that criss-crossed in and out of itself, a stunning fantasy that coupled geometric intricacy with organic fluidity and pulse—all in stone. And it had dimension, as the topmost ribbons cast hard, shifting shadows on the ribbons underneath. It seemed as if the room were a cage keeping out a kaleidoscopic vision stolen from a burgeon binge and brought to life. And that topmost layer, the bars of this cage, graduated from a swirl of ribbon at the floor into a prickling fence of barbed thorns towards the ceiling, and like climbing vines they spiraled all the way up this bulge of a room and converged towards the center of the ceiling, merging into the lashes of an oval eye whose iris was the open shaft which led ever upwards and into the light of day.
The room smelled like a urinal. And before this smell could truly sour Mandri’s experience, an unseen hand grabbed a fistful of Mandri’s robe between his shoulder blades and yanked him off the rope. He was then plopped ass-first onto the richly patterned floor and the pain in his thigh reasserted itself.
The woman who’d pulled him out was Seb, and the smell was coming from her.
“What is this place?” Mandri asked in whispered wonder.
“This be Minting Rock,” Seb said as her near-toothless mouth squelched a borcandi spine. She was obviously an old hand at borcandi biting because she carried herself with that borcandi bent—like her muscles were stuck in tension and had been that way for years, shoulders hunched and tight, head knocked forward, limbs all slightly bowed as if she’d coiled up in fright and rusted that way. 
“I don’t care about the name,” Mandri said. “What is this place? Who made it?”
Seb nudged Mandri’s hip with the toe of her boot, and then shooed him up against the wall with a few flaps of her fingers.
“Keep out of the way,” she said.
Mandri scooted backwards against the wall and shoved his injured leg flush against it, so that nothing of him stuck out into the floor. 
She eased in close, the neck of her robe yawned at Mandri’s nose, and her odor was pouring out—she smelled like butter gone bad. She peered into Mandri’s eyes and said, “I can tell you a burgeon biter, ain’t ya?”
Her odor was nauseating. Mandri scrunched up his nose and simply replied, “You smell.”
Seb stood back up, then wilted. Even a hard-up outland woman couldn’t abide being found out like that. A woman’s face could be ugly as mud, that was the world’s fault—but her smell, her smell was coming from the inside and it said something about her without her meaning to. A bad smell is the one thing that could make the most loutish street-junk keeper feel shame. A bad smell is a secret everyone’s got to keep.
“What’d I tell ya bout flappin’ them lips?”
Seb’s tired eyes managed to impress upon Mandri a great disappointment. Seb was a nobody amongst nobodies, as irrelevant as one of Jeket’s crawlers—beggars who beg from beggars. Mandri had a sense for these people even if they hadn’t yet fallen that far. There’s a dopiness about them, the face kind of sags. And they smell. To a man and woman, they smell.
A shrill whistle suddenly rang out from the oculus above. A heartbeat later, and Minting Rock was alive with the slapping patter of leather-soled feet as muffled shouts reared out of unseen corridors. It was as if Minting Rock’s door had just been knocked and all the house mutts were flung into a muster. Hill came climbing up the well-shaft rope, his stout frame slinking up and up like a fat caterpillar. He regarded neither Mandri nor Seb as he disappeared into the chamber above.
There came, springing out of the passage to Mandri’s left, a clink of metal on stone. This thumping clink repeated again and again, in time with a giant’s stride, growing louder as it neared Mandri’s chamber. Mandri found himself trembling when Ayram stormed into the room from the nearby hallway, beard-jutting and wild-eyed. In his hand was his long iron spear, which barely cleared the passage’s ceiling.
Moto followed him in, and waddling in behind Moto was the short, black-ragged witch, Elrahet. She lingered in the passage mouth, under the flickering lamps, and her dark hood cast a long, hard shadow which hid her eyes from view. Mandri watched her as she watched Ayram. There was a familiarity about her that he couldn’t quite place.
Ayram and Moto were standing in the opposite end of the room. On the ground between them was a shadowy lump. Moto kicked it, and a dull crack sounded out. He then grabbed one of the sculptured ribbons affixed to the wall to steady himself, and he was about to deliver another rough kick when Elrahet shouted, “Stop!”
Moto stopped.
“The Mazid is awake,” said Elrahet, as if pressed for time.
Moto stepped back and let the meager light reveal that the lump on the ground was Obo—he lay there with his half-lidded eyes blinking about like he’d just woken up from a dream.
“Tell me how you did it,” Ayram growled. His deep voice was twice as deep inside this echo chamber.
Obo looked up at Ayram and regarded the giant with contempt. He said, voice hoarse, “What are you blaming me for now?”
Ayram did not reply. He didn’t need to. A man his size could simply stand still, and that was intimidating enough to scare a reluctant tree into shaking off its fruit.
Obo pushed himself up into a sitting position. His head drooped as if his neck were so weak it couldn’t bear the burden. Mandri thought Obo was playing too hard for sympathy here.
Obo said, “I know it can be difficult, sometimes, to draw a clear line between cause and effect, but blaming me for anything seems unsound.”
Ayram lifted his great spear, then let it slip down his fist and its wide chisel tip hit the stone floor next to Obo’s hip.
Obo was unimpressed. “You’re the one that captured me and brought me here. If I’ve brought you any trouble, then you’ve brought it upon yourself.”
Ayram remained silent. Mandri suspected the man was realizing that Obo was incapable of feeling fear.
“If I may take a moment to ask,” said Obo. “What is it you truly plan to do with me? I’m a curious creature, I’d love to know.”
With a twist of his wrist, Ayram set the iron spike to rest against Obo’s collar bone. The weight of it almost tipped Obo over. Obo tried to shrug it off, but Ayram set it right back on the bone. 
Obo looked down at the spike’s tip and was unimpressed. “Did you honestly believe that a Hrkan Lord would make a weapon as powerful as me without devising a way to track me down should I get loose?”
“They can track you down to anywhere?” Moto asked. 
“Have you truly never heard of the Mazidariga?”
Mandri had never heard of the Mazidariga. And judging by the dumbfounded expression in Moto’s eyes, and the odd tilt in Ayram’s chin, neither man had heard of it either. Since neither were willing to admit to not knowing something, an uneasy silence went unbroken until Elrahet grumbled aloud, “Riga means shadow.”
Moto bent down and began to examine Obo’s shadow on the wall for a sign of some obscure magic.
“Not my literal shadow,” Obo said with disdain. “A Mazid’s shadow is a creature. They are grown alongside us. Their purpose is to hunt us down. You cannot hope to hide from the Hrks so long as you hold onto me.”
“Moto,” said Ayram after a thoughtful pause.
“Yes?”
“Get the boys blooded up.”
“Right,” said Moto. He then jumped onto the well-shaft rope and climbed out of sight with only a few, powerful pulls.
“You’re going to fight them?” Obo asked in disbelief as he watched Moto disappear. “That’s very brave. I hope you don’t expect I’ll be of much help.”
Ayram twisted around to glare at Obo, and then Mandri. It might have been the shadows, but Mandri thought he saw a flash of ire.
“Oh, it’s not Mandri’s fault,” said Obo. “He could be the most willful Minder of all, and it’d be no use. You see, a Mazidariga can—”
Ayram spun his spear around so that the sphere-end struck the ground. The metallic clang shut Obo up. Seb, anticipating a word from her leader, stepped forward.
Ayram said, “Take our useless Minder and his Mazid up into a haspt.”
Seb bowed in deference as Ayram and Elrahet swept out of the chamber, back into the passage from whence they came. Ayram’s iron clinked against the stone as he went, though the sound was soon lost amongst the yip and din as a band of the hardest pokes prepared themselves for battle.
Seb grabbed Mandri’s wrist and yanked him to his feet. Mandri groaned as his leg screamed. Seb hurried over to Obo and made a fuss about wrapping him up tight so that his blood-wet stub sacks wouldn’t taint her person. Once Obo was swaddled up tight as a baby, arms folded inside a restricting robe, Seb picked him up and carried him under-arm like a freshly-wrapped package of beef. 
She ran into the dark passage. Then she popped back out and grunted for Mandri to follow.
Mandri limped after her, steadying himself against the sculptured stone, but he couldn’t keep up.
“Hurry up!” Seb cried as she doubled back and took hold of Mandri’s wrist. She pulled Mandri towards a sputtering lamp whose light flickered over a set of chubby, upward swirling stairs. Ascending these stairs put an odd twist in Mandri’s mental map of the place, and it became difficult to maintain a sense of where he was within the rock. There was almost no light, and he was shoved through so many warped passages that all he knew for certain was that he was moving away from the center. Every new chamber and corridor became more cluttered and cramped, and the stonework less polished and more rough. The walls were still sculpted into an otherworldly weave but Mandri’s fingers could feel an inattention to thickness of edge. It was clumsy work, clumsy in comparison to what he’d seen in that central shaft.
Mandri got to thinking, after bumping his head on an absurdly low door frame, that whoever had carved this rock had perhaps carved out too much of it. Unless Old Jandri tribesmen were as learned as Hrkan architects in the art of stressing stone, the whole thing was bound to fall apart. And the further up and out Mandri went, the more slapdash the passages and rooms became. By the time he reached the outer edge of the rock, and saw a slit of bright blue sky though an embrasure, his fingers were brushing over stress cracks in walls. Once, in this dusty dark, he bumped his shoulder against an unworked wooden beam that arched over his head. He swore he saw the floor above buckle and sag.
Seb pushed him into a long and narrow room. It was long enough for him to lay down in, but barely enough room to turn around. This space had access to outside air through a stippled pattern of finger-sized holes bored into the far wall. The sun didn’t shine directly through them, so these pinpricks of day sat on the black rock wall illuminating nothing, like a constellation of stars. They composed an Old Jandri pattern—a simple, eight-flamed sun, the traditional symbol of Solraheen.
Seb elbowed Mandri further into this shoulder-squeezing closet, and that’s when the room’s defining quality hit him—the air inside was thick with a foul smell, sweet and horrible, cloying, as if a mound of peaches were putrefying in some dark corner. Mandri gagged, clutched at his nose, and when the spicy bitterness stung the back of his tongue like rancid burgeon bile he spat and choked.
He thought, at first, that this was some kind of prayer room and that the smell was incense put here to trigger his spiritual impulse. He didn’t entertain the thought that this scent was meant to mask a fouler smell until he reached out into the dark to steady himself, and instead of slapping against stone, his fingers sank into something that felt curiously like skin.
He yelped and recoiled.
He leaned back into the opposite wall, and his palm brushed up against a dried and bony limb.
He yelped again, and prayed fast that Solraheen would adjust his eyes to the darkness. He’d have pulled his own Spark out to see.
Seb slapped the back of his head. “Keep your hands to yourself.”
“What’s in here?”
“Don’t worry about it.”
Seb pushed Mandri towards the stipple-pricked sigil of Solraheen.
Mandri turned to protest his new accommodation.
“Sit down and be quiet,” Seb commanded.
Before Mandri could frame his dissent, a dark shape flew towards him and crashed into his stomach. He wheezed, went sprawling against the wall and sank down to the floor. He fumbled around in the dark and squealed in disgust when his thumb poked through a stiff and gristly cloth and dove into something with the consistency of fire-crusted jelly.
He’d just plumbed his thumb into Obo’s stumped thigh.
“Get off me!” Mandri shrieked.
“I hardly can,” said Obo. “I’m wrapped up tight.”
Mandri picked Obo up with his one good hand. The Mazid was as light as a three-year-old.
“Put me down.”
“Stop wiggling.”
“I’m not, you’re shaking me.”
“There’s nowhere to put you.”
“Quit flappin’!” Seb shouted. “And stop touchin’ shit. Place is sacred.”
Mandi didn’t want to get slapped so he shut up and stuffed Obo between his good right leg and the wall. He had to bunch himself up closer to the other side of this narrow closet of a room, and that was a dicey proposition, because something dead was resting there and he didn’t want his wound rubbing up against it. 
Mandri prayed for a light, and by Sol, there it was—the diffuse orange glow of a lamp light came creeping up the corridor behind Seb. Seb spun around and there was the girl Moteah, standing in the room’s entrance, looking less prim and proper than Mandri remembered. Her long beige robe had a few wrinkles, and her severe headscarf was gone, showing her hair to be as wild as a weedbush. Her black skin glistened from all the kell oil she’d smeared on her face.
Mandri recalled the sight of her glaring at him in that pit cave a day or two before. Somehow, she seemed even more uptight, and she peered around Seb at Mandri, as if looking for him. 
“Move,” she said to Seb. Seb begrudgingly stepped out of the room to give Moteah the space to enter. As she did, the oil-dish lamp she held before her splayed its light into the room’s interior, bringing this haunting ‘closet’ to life.
Cut into the black rock walls were coffin-sized slits, three on either side, stacked one above the other. Inside each of these, resting in peaceful repose, was a corpse, each in a different stage of decomposition, and each naked as it came from the womb, and all of them, as far as Mandri could tell, were giant men. Ayram-sized men. Their beards were black and gray.
The corpse that the light lit clearest was as black and shriveled as a grape weeks fallen from the vine. It was impossible to say for certain how long that body had been lying there, for an unbothered corpse in the Sand could last an age, but cloistered away in Minting Rock, sheltered from the wind and abrasion, well Mandri figured that a corpse could last for as long as Solraheen willed it. That body could be as ancient as the sun itself.
Shadows licked at the corpse’s dry, pruned up shoulder. Its desiccated hand with purpled fingers sat on the grave’s edge, like a giant spider creeping into the light. All of it was frosted by a layer of dust. There was no hint of bloat, no tar-like iridescence of fresh rot, though it was clearly the source of the smell. Mandri compared the disgusting sight of it to his own leg. He wasn’t faring much better.
Moteah set her lamp down in a shallow recess in the wall which had been carved for the purpose. In her other arm she clutched a small grass basket close to her chest, and this she set on the floor at Mandri’s feet. She squatted down and began to unload it—first out was a puffy square of gray wool folded into itself. Next was a bundle of damp, hairy, spade-shaped leaves knotted at the stems. Then came a stone mortar which tinked against the floor. Last came three small alabastron jars that were packed to the brim with waxy substances, one red, one green, and one blue. Moteah hesitated with these, treated them more gently than the rest, and once all were arrayed out before her, she handed the basket back to Seb, who tucked it mindlessly into one of the corpsedens.
“All yours,” Seb said, and she left the room.
Moteah ignored her and said, “Let me see the bite.”
Mandri hesitated, then drew up his robe and leaned onto his right ass cheek. He rolled his wounded thigh into the light. The old poultice was wrinkled and sloppy, hanging half off, and Moteah eyed the dark veins in his leg with a keen interest.
“Would you look at that,” she muttered.
She pulled a thumb-sized pestle from her woolen robes and she dolloped a two-finger-dip of each of the colorful waxes into her mortar.
“How bad does it hurt?”
“About as bad as can be.”
Mandri winced as she peeled back the old poultice to reveal the black wound underneath. It was an awful sight, smothered over with that mucky paste.
“You are lucky,” she said. “One more night and it would have killed you.”
“Wish it would.”
Moteah pushed Mandri back with a miffed look, and then set herself to mixing the medicine in the mouth of her mortar. She poured a finger-full of water from her personal waterskin into it, swirled it around with the wax, then plucked three leaves and dropped them onto the swimming globs of color. She let it all soak for a spell, and then she began to knead it all into a paste.
Mandri watched with eager intent, and so did Obo. Obo leaned over Mandri’s legs, tried to peer into the mixture, but since he was hardly more than a ribcage swiveling on hips, leaning was a chancy thing. Mandri had to catch him to keep him from tipping over, and this commotion interrupted the rhythmic thump of Moteah’s pestle.
She paused and gave Obo the same miffed look she’d given Mandri a moment before.
Obo caught her eye and said, “I thought that wax was insoluble in water.”
“Must not be wax,” she said, and she resumed smashing the bits of leaves down into the sopping goop. By now the colors were beginning to mix, turning a greenish shade of brown that looked nearly black in the lamplight. Obo was polite enough to wait until she was finished to ask, “Would you mind if I tasted it?”
The disgust in Moteah’s face was absolute. Most outland women end up with rumpled foreheads, and it’s not only from squinting at the sun. From first blood they’re fighting wars of aggravation against outland men. The difference here was that the nuisance at hand was a Mazid, not a man, and he wasn’t rebuffed in the usual way. His eyes were bright, expecting entertainment.
Moteah huffed her irritation, then set again to her work. She unfolded the woolen square to make a pocket, which she then packed full with the dark goo from her mortar.
“I’d like to introduce myself,” Obo said.
“I’d like you not to,” she replied as she scraped the bottom of the mortar to make sure she’d left no leavings.
“What about you?” Obo asked Mandri. “Would you like to introduce yourself?”
“No, not really.”
“Are you sure?”
“Obo, be quiet.” 
“You call it Obo?” Moteah asked as her brow knit ever tighter.
“That’s his name.”
“You’re not to talk to it.”
“Then put him in a different room.”
Moteah soured at Mandri’s sass. She cradled the poultice patch in her hand and slapped it paste-down on Mandri’s wound. A shock of pain ran through his hip, and he nearly bit through his tongue. Just as he was about to curse the girl’s name, a quick iciness shot into his leg and chased the pain deep down to the bone. When the wincing excitement wore off, he was surprised to find that the pain was gone completely. His leg was numb cold.
“Oh,” he said, relief shaping his voice. “That was fast.”
Moteah’s eyes narrowed. “You’re welcome.” She was clearly expecting thanks, but unfortunately for her, she looked a little too much like her brother for Mandri to say thank you.
“You know your brother did this to me,” he said.
The twist in Moteah’s brow unraveled with a tired sigh.  She sat back on her haunches and said, “I would apologize, but I try not to make a habit of cleaning up after him.” 
“Oh,” Mandri muttered. “Well, thanks—for, you know—this.”
She flashed a quick smile, more in reflex than appreciation. “You’ve had a hard few days, so, don’t chase away help when it comes.”
“You’re here to help?”
“I am.”
“Beautiful. If you could help me escape, that’d be great.”
She smiled, this time it was big and bright. “You wouldn’t last a hand out in the Sand by yourself.”
“Does that matter? I don’t suppose I’ll last long with you people either.”
She hesitated before replying. It almost looked like she was counting her words. She said, “I know Ayram is rough, and Elrahet can be worse, but out here that works. It doesn’t work with everyone, I know, but what you have to remember is that the cause is all that matters.”
“Killing a demon?”
“Killing the Amalgamete, yes.”
“If I may ask,” Obo interrupted, “Why was Mandri chosen to be Minder, of all people?”
Mandri marveled at how hard it was to read Obo’s face. The Mazid played at indignation, but it wasn’t quite that, not really. Hard to read a face without features—hairless brows, lashless eyes, and colorless skin—Obo looked more like an under-painting than a fully realized person.
Moteah said, “Elrahet chose him, and I trust her judgment.”
“Why trust her?” Obo asked. “She seems mad.”
“She’s a witch,” Mandri added.
“She’s much more than a witch. I know she seems…unpleasant, but she is here to help. In her own way, she is here to help.”
“She’s the one who cut off my hand, right? Put it in Obo’s chest?”
Moteah nodded.
“Obo says that me being made Minder is going to kill me. Is that true?”
“The sooner we kill the Amalgamete, the sooner you can be rid of the Mazid and any ill effects.”
She saw Mandri wasn’t convinced, and she added, “Do you not want to kill the source of evil in this world?”
“I never even heard of the beast until a few days ago. I’ve never seen it.”
“Oh, you’ll see it, and when you see it, you’ll understand.”
Obo asked, “Have you seen it?”
“Yes, and no.”
As Mandri wondered how that could be construed as an acceptable answer, a worried, wordless shout sounded out from somewhere below. That shout was followed by a loud, two-fingered whistle ringing through the rock. 
Moteah fetched her basket and gathered her ministrations. She swept herself up, and before she left the room she turned and asked, “If I leave, do you swear to stay here?”
Mandri gathered up the loose ends of his poultice wrap and tied them around his leg. “I don’t think I’m ready to run away just yet,” he said.
She stood firm. “Swear it.”
Mandri chuckled and said, “I swear it.”
He would have explained that he wasn’t good for his word, but she’d already left. Thankfully, she’d left her oil lamp.
“She is interesting,” Obo remarked.
“Better than her brother, that’s for sure.”
“I agree. But all it takes is one ruined dream to make you people miserable.”
“Is that so?” Mandri asked as he tied a tight knot below the poultice to add a little something to support it.
“That girl seems to think that you will be able to wield me. Unfortunately that will never happen.”
“Why not?”
“To put it simply—you’re too kind to be a Minder.”
“Hah!” Mandri exclaimed as a smirk played on his lips. “Obo, you don’t know the first thing about me.”
“But I do. You forget that I am bound to your will. As we speak your fingers are gripping my heart. I can feel what you feel, if it’s strong enough. I’ve had four different Minders, four different wills coursing through my veins, and each was as pitiless as the other. So believe me when I tell you that I know what cruelty feels like—you don’t have it. It’s a constant gnawing. If you aren’t cruel, then you must be kind.”
Mandri had a hard time getting past the image of his hand squeezing Obo’s heart. He said, “Kindness doesn’t mean what you think it means.”
“Oh?”
“Think about it. On average, and this is more than true, on average people are more likely to hate each other than love each other. So if kindness is how people treat their own kind, then a kind person is a selfish, hostile person.”
“I think you’ve spent too much time biting burgeons.”
“You think I’m wrong?”
“I think you’re distracted. It doesn’t matter what word we use to describe the particular feeling that you feel. I said kindness, and while that might not be it, it doesn’t change the fact that you aren’t cruel. At any rate, we’re far afield from the problem at hand.”
“I disagree. We’re right on point. If you were to tell me to be kind to someone, I’m going to be kind, but I have a different, more correct, understanding of the word.”
“No. Stop.”
Obo wiggled around in his tightly wrapped robes. He cocked his ear towards the stipple-pricked wall and listened for something which Mandri could not hear.
Mandri asked, “What is it?”
After a suspenseful pause, Obo answered, “There is a column of Hrkan Skulsi marching towards this rock.”
“Oh.”
“When they get here, they’re going to slaughter us all.”
Obo’s silver eyes settled into an easy gleam as if he were happy about it.
Mandri was about to ask ‘how long till they arrive’, but the answer rudely interrupted him—from out beyond the stipple-pricked sun of Solraheen came the deep and yawning howl of the Hrkan horn of war. 

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooommmm

The whole room vibrated. The rest of Minting Rock was sent stirring with the hollers as the Ayramun whooped their excitement. Mandri, bewildered, gingerly pushed himself up against the narrow walls, careful to not bother his leg, all so that he could turn and look through one of the small holes in that stippled sun. He couldn’t see much, but sure enough, set against a field of fiery sand was a distant column of white-robed men.
“Well, I think this proves my point,” he said. “People don’t march around like that to help widows and orphans, do they?”
“They don’t.”
“That is the kindness of men in full regalia… and now we wait to see whose kindness is stronger, those Hrks or our Ayramun.”
“I can almost guarantee that you will be dead in less than half a hand.”
“I think the Ayramun can win.”
“Seventeen Ayramun against eighty Skulsi is long odds.”
“Ayram’s got to count for at least twenty. And this rock is practically a fortress. It’s got murder holes. What are the Hrks going to do, lay siege? Out here in the desert?”
“I don’t know, but I’m sure they have a plan.”
“And we’ve got a Mazid.”
“Who is ‘we’?”
“Oh come on, Obo. You know, I’ve never actually seen a Mazid spit Mazidfire.”
“And you likely never will.”
“We could at least try.”
“Do what you will.”
“Teach me.”
“I can’t.”
“You know how it works. Come on, I thought we were friends.”
“We are?”
“Obo, if you open your mouth and blast those Hrks to Shis, I will wash your feet with sweet oil.”
“I don’t have any feet.”
“I’ll wash your nubs with the richest sweet oil I can find. I’ll make it myself.”
 Obo smiled, but he still didn’t match Mandri’s enthusiasm. He said, “You know that Mazidariga I mentioned earlier?”
“What of it?”
“Just wait a moment. It’s going to end me.”
Mandri was halfway through a frustrated sigh, when a shrill and steady whistle sounded out from the Hrkan column and pierced his thoughts, pushing out all other concerns. 
It was a metallic, tinny tone that quivered like a strandtail’s warble, only it was ten times louder and harsher than any shriek any bird could ever make. That damned sound cut through the rock so clearly that its source might as well have been in the room. For Mandri, it was an ear-splitting pain, but to Obo it was doing something stranger.
The Mazid had fallen over onto his side and was squirming. His eyes rolled around in their sockets, twitching and turning as if a worm were chewing his ocular nerve. The whistling jumped to a higher pitch and Obo’s whole body began to convulse in violent fits. Mandri reached out to keep Obo’s head from thumping against the stone, but Obo’s stomach wretched, his chest heaved, and a dim gray formless ember shot out from his mouth, leaving his body limp and lifeless.
The strange light hovered just above Obo’s lips for the briefest sPel, and then the whistling shifted its register again, higher still into a pitch reserved for animal spirits, and the gray ember shot right towards Mandri’s head.
He ducked and the ember whizzed past his neck, its energy scorching his skin as it went. It zipped on to punch a hole the size of Mandri’s fist into the rock behind him. Mandri spun around in time to watch it fly up into the air. He lost sight of it for a moment against the bright midday sky, then found it again as it dove towards the distant column of Hrks. As it fell, the whistling fell to a drowning timbre, until, with a flash, the light and the whistling were snuffed out altogether, apparently swallowed by a figure at the head of the Hrkan column—a figure much shorter than the rest and robed in black.
Before Mandri’s ears could recover their tuning, the Hrkan horn of war sounded out again.

BWWWEEEEeeeeoooooooommmm

The deep bellow shook Mandri out of his skin. Terror welled up in his gut. He could see the column clearly now through his punched out window, and as the Hrks marched they flattened out into a solid square. A command was barked and the soldiers quickened their advance, bracing their white, oblong shields up against the smattering of arrows that was sure to come.
Twenty paces later, and Mandri heard the twang of bows and the fluttering phhht of arrow fletchings brushing through the air, rushing high up into the sky. Ten Hrkan paces later, and a flock of black arrows fell upon the hide of that onrushing Hrkan square. Most of these missiles bounced harmlessly away, but some snuck in between the scales, marked here and there by the sudden tumbling of one of the Hrkan number, each followed by a chorus of triumphant yips as several Ayramun took credit all at once.
These little victories did nothing to slow the Hrkan advance. Every gap opened by the felling of one soldier was closed in quick-step time, and when, at last, it was clear that they would not scatter and flee, the yips of the Ayramun twisted into stressed appeals for Solraheen’s intervention. The more practical among them sprinted from room to room, trying to find better angled holes to fire upon their target, sometimes crashing into each other, each screaming insults as whole bundles of arrows were split.
Seb rushed by Mandri’s hole, then came back, noticing the fresh new vantage in the wall.
“Move out of the way!” she shouted as she ran in. She kicked Obo’s lifeless body to the side, then squatted down and started firing arrows at the marching men. They were close enough now that their eyes could be clearly seen peering over their shields.
Seb fired her arrows with ruthless efficiency, but judging by the stream of curses that followed every shot, she was missing her mark. After each twang of her bow, her shooting angle shifted steeper and steeper down to match the Hrkan advance, until at last the white-cloaked Hrks tucked themselves up under Minting Rock’s bulging belly. Seb then grabbed her bow in both hands and snapped it on her knee. She tossed the kindling at Mandri and pulled her dagger, then fled from the room.
Then Mandri heard a noise which froze his body solid.

Chink-TINK.

“What was that?” Mandri wondered aloud.

Chink-TINK.

It sounded like a chisel.
He looked again through the hole in the wall and tried to make sense of the situation. So high up, it was impossible to see directly below. He only caught glimpses of upturned shields, and in the center of each, the gold-eyed Hrkan sun was looking up at him with dumb indifference.

TINK-TINK-TINK

The chiseling was getting louder, faster, followed close behind by the roars of Hrkan men possessed by the spirit of battle. Somewhere far below, in Minting Rock’s entrance well, limbs were getting hacked to pieces.
Then came a loud stone-splitting crack and the whole of Minting Rock lurched. 
Mandri stumbled but caught himself as the sound of crunching rock ran through the floor and ceiling.

CRRRCKKKKkkkk-krrrk-kkkkkk-k

All went silent in the wake of this rock-hewn thunder.
No shouts of struggle below.
No clash of sword on shield.
For a brief, glorious moment, every Sparked body, from man to flea, dropped their troubles and shared the exact same fearish feeling, and this glorious communion might have lasted forever if it weren’t split by the tinny sound of another chisel strike on stone.

TINK

A long, jagged crack exploded into the floor of Mandri’s burial chamber as Minting Rock lurched again. The dust of ages shook loose from the ceiling, as if the room above had been hammered by Solraheen’s fist.
“Obo,” Mandri said to the glassy-eyed and lifeless Mazid. “Obo, we’d better leave.”
Another jolt shook the room, and the crack in the floor opened wider. Mandri shuffled away just as a thunderous boom sent the crack darting across the whole length of the floor and up the sun-stippled wall, fracturing the chamber in two. With a sudden crunch, the chamber’s whole left side slid down an inch before coming to a rest on some new fault in the foundation far below.
Mandri, fear pulsing wild in his chest, yanked one of the aged corpses out of its resting place and tossed it onto the ground. He then grabbed Obo’s limp body and threw the Mazid into the now unoccupied grave. He pushed Obo as far towards the back as he could, and then he crawled in alongside. The very moment that Mandri tucked in his legs, the opposite wall started to collapse.
The first thing to go was Moteah’s clay oil lamp. It jostled loose from its perch and smashed onto the floor, splashing licks of oil and flame about the room. Then the wall behind it shook, and the seams in the ceiling burst, shooting a jet of smoke into the room, flooding Mandri’s grave with dust, obscuring the air so completely that Mandri could not see the hail of stone come crashing down.
What he did see, after wiping the dust from his eyes, was the awesome sight of Minting Rock split in half like a geode.
Before he could even register his shock, the opposite half began to fall away. 
Haunting screams split the air as those Ayramun stuck on the wrong side of this split-open stone grasped their impending doom. Three men jumped across to Mandri’s side, but below, a ragged, fear-stricken woman straddled the half-shorn wall of what once was a tunnel. Mandri watched in terror as she rode the undone structure down into a billowing cloud of dust, crying, “Sol! Sol!” as she went.
Mandri closed his eyes against the deafening crash.
“Solraheen, my god,” he prayed. It was the start of a daily prayer, but there was nothing in it for he’d long forgotten the rest of the words. He hoped it was the thought that counted.
He opened his eyes again, and peered down at the chaos from his blessed perch. The floor was completely gone, and in its place was a hundred foot drop down into a swirl of rust-colored smoke. Beyond that, the bright desert stretched out for forever.
A shout rang out below. This wasn’t a shout of fright. It was a shout of effort, of murder. Mandri watched as the swirling smoke lifted to reveal a swarm of white Hrkan cloaks, some moving amongst the crumble of black rock, some deathly still, and some of those black rocks moved, some jumped out of the structure still left standing—these were Ayramun in their dark, dusty rags. Once again, the battle was joined.
Mandri crept back into his hole—there was no clear way to get down, not that he wanted to. He was oddly happy to be stuck up in his high hole. No matter who won down below, he’d be safe.

TINK-TINK-TINK

Whatever demon had split open Minting Rock was not finished, and this time Mandri could feel the chisel strokes resonate all through the rock around him.
He curled up in his grave, wrapped his head in his hands and tried to shut out the horror of it, but this was no good, because his sense of equilibrium remained, and it screamed bloody murder as his half of Minting Rock began to tilt.
At first it was only a slight shifting as the rock swayed away from the melee down below. Then a loud clap of snapping stone sounded out, and Mandri’s perch swayed precariously back the opposite direction. He scrambled to grab hold of something, to stop himself from spilling out of his hole and into the open air, and just as his hip began to slide, a thunder of faulting joints burst up from below, and a puff of smoke shot up from the ground.
The whole terrifying thing swayed back away yet again, before settling into an unstable, precipitous tilt.
What was left of Minting Rock dithered there, letting the dread get nice and settled in Mandri’s belly, until, at last, there came a shattering CRACK, and the structure began to fall.
Mandri braced himself in that half-shorn tomb as the horizon fell out of the sky.
The whole structure rolled onto its back like a freshly halved melon, and Mandri could do nothing but look to the sky and be helpless. If there were clouds they would have been zipping by, but there was only the atmosphere, that gradient of blue shifting into a deeper blue, and for the first time ever, Mandri noticed that the desert sky is a bluer blue than any other. He didn’t have time to wonder why that was, for amid the rush and tumble his sight was swallowed up by a cloud of black-red dust, a suffocating blur of sand and stone. As Mandri began to realize the horror of being buried alive, his rock grave snapped open, and the back of it sprung loose like a tensioned lever, catapulting him into the air. 
Mandri flew low above the surface of the earth, and such was his speed that he smashed right through the brambles of a karkle bush before tumbling into a ragdoll skip along the surface of the warm, red-orange sand.
When he finally came to a stop, he found himself half buried in a fledgling dune.
And he was alive.
He pulled himself free from the earth, spat some of it out of his mouth, coughed a bit of dust out of his lungs, then rubbed his eyes open, surprised to see that his scrawny self was still well-put-together. The shoulder which had borne the brunt of impact wasn’t even scratched. There weren’t any bones sticking out, at least. And while the demon bite on his leg was still smarting, Moteah’s poultice was still knotted tight. Everything else was where it was supposed to be, save for his hand. The only thing that truly hurt was the left side of his face, which had bit the sand when he landed. Still, that was nothing. Considering everything, that was nothing. He’d been tossed almost fifty yards and was no worse for wear. Meanwhile, what was left of Minting Rock had collapsed into a heap of rubble.
It was a miracle. 
It was a miracle coming after a string of miracles.
By rights he should be dead—dead three times over. In Meskalim, Salavan had choked him to death, and he’d come back from that. He’d been chewed up by a demon, and he just so happened to be traveling with a woman who knew how to cure it. And now he’d survived a fall from a height that should have squashed him flat.
Yet here he was, alive and breathing.
“Wild.”
He looked up at the bright blue sky and blinked at the sun, and he felt, in that blessed moment, that he was staring into the Spark of Solraheen Himself. Perhaps this rapture would have drawn out a word of praise, and he might have become, then and there, the most devout of all possible men, but it was not to be, for a Hrkan Skulsi was creeping up behind him.
“Die, you rangy lizard!”
Mandri turned and saw a mustachioed man in a sparkling white robe running at him with his blade drawn high. Despite the look of fury and rage twisting this soldier’s face, Mandri wasn’t frightened. Actually, he felt a confidence brewing. If he was supposed to be dead three times over, then what was a fourth?
He held up his hands and shouted, “I surrender!”
The soldier stopped his sprint and seemed pleased to hear it. A proud curve swelled in his chest, and he stomped over to where Mandri knelt. 
“My luck I should catch a coward,” he said. He held his shining iron sword towards Mandri’s neck and beckoned with its tip for Mandri to stand up.
Mandri stood up.
“Walk,” said the soldier, and he pointed with his sword in the desired direction, towards a detachment of white cloaked soldiers standing some thirty yards away from the cloud of Minting Rock’s still seething rubble. Those Hrks stood shoulder to shoulder, watching the throes of Minting Rock as if it were something they’d seen ten times before, and perhaps they had. They were big, bearded men, veterans of many battles.
Mandri winced as his captor’s sword prodded the small of his back, and he walked towards the Hrkan line. The squealing stone of Minting Rock settled into its final resting place, giving Mandri’s still-stunned hearing the chance to pick out the clamor of battle—breathless shouts of fury, metal clanging against metal, a staccato burst of excited yips, punctuated by a twist of agony.
The first actual figure to pop out of that lifting smoke was Moto. Of course, the Zosan of all people should survive. He crouched atop a tall, slanted chunk of former floor, and with one hand he steadied himself, and with his sword he deftly waved off three Hrkan blades swiping at his ankles. Then Moteah came scrambling out from a hole in the nearby rubble, and as soon as she came she disappeared back into the swirling cloud of dust. Two Hrkan cloaks chased after her, but both came to a sudden, fluttering stop after something swung out of the dust and slammed into both their chests at once—a bone-crunching WHUMP.
The two men collapsed to the ground, and standing over them was Ayram.
The giant was so caked in dust that he looked like a creature borne from the Sand. The upper part of his black robe was hanging in tatters over his waistband like it were half-molted skin, and his long black hair, freed from his headwrap, was sweeping his shoulders clean as he twirled his blackened iron spear like it were a reed. He slammed it down and smashed its knobby end right through the skull of one of the fallen Hrks.
The blood-crunch was so loud and gruesome that Mandri almost tripped on it.
The three Hrkan men who’d been hassling Moto turned their pestering swords towards the giant. These men screamed curses at Ayram, this giant who’d slain their comrade with such brutal indifference. Ayram charged them, swung his spear in a swooping arc, and that famed Skulsi discipline went to Shis as the iron crunched through the first Hrk’s shield. In a blur, the chisel-head swung round and sliced right through the face of another Hrk. The final hapless soldier charged and stabbed, but such was Ayram’s speed that his iron spear was around again in time to brush the sword right out of the Skulsi’s hand. 
The man backed away in fright. He picked up a rock and threw it at Ayram’s head, and before Mandri could see how Ayram dealt with it, he felt another sharp prodding in his back.
“Get a move on!” his captor shouted. The man was unconcerned about his comrade’s plight. He was more interested in getting Mandri to the Hrkan line. So impatient was he, that he took Mandri by the wrist, upped the pace to a jog, and yanked a howling Mandri along behind, for though Moteah’s poultice was a soothing balm, the demon-bitten leg wasn’t capable of handling a run.
After much fumbling and stumbling, they reached the Hrkan detachment and Mandri was thrown down to the sand. His captor set the cold edge of his blade on the back of Mandri’s neck to keep his head bowed in supplication. The man then pounded his chest twice, the standard Hrkan salute, and with the snap of a well-drilled soldier he declared, “My sirs, I’ve found another skulking bandit.”
Mandri overcame the fear of the blade pressing against his neck to peep at the ‘sirs’ this soldier was referring to, and he was stunned to see that standing in front of him was a child, a boy, robed in black. Mandri stole a second glance and realized that it was not a boy, but a creature, white and hairless underneath its robes, just like Obo. It was so short that Mandri, kneeling, met him eye to bloodshot eye. Shielding this creature’s nose and mouth was a smooth iron plate riveted onto a leather band that was strapped tight around its head. It was a strange sort of muzzle, with only a small beveled hole for sipping air, and, Mandri presumed, for whistling, for no doubt this was the Mazidariga who had whistled Obo’s pseudospark into its own stomach. 
This Riga’s eyes were a child’s eyes, large and curious, yet their whites were so red that their edges were weeping blood, and worse still, the creature seemed unbothered by it.
Next to this Riga child was a short bald man clad in the gray-blue robes of a Hrkan scribe. All the fat on this man’s body seemed to have settled in his face, giving him a curiously large head for his diminutive frame. It was such an incongruity, and scribes were such venal creatures, that Mandri wondered if this man had bribed some youth for the use of their body. It was either that, or he, next to this Mazidariga, was a fleshcrafted work of the Hrkan Lords.
This scribe did not look at all pleased to see Mandri. No scribe ever was, for scribes of rank were learned men of acquired power, and they kept their silver sunrose brooches bright and blinding. They put so much effort into setting themselves apart that they could sense when someone didn’t appreciate them. 
The man looked down at Mandri, and with plain derision in his voice he said, “Another coward lurking in the rubble. And look—he’s missing a hand.”
The Riga child coughed, as if clearing his throat of sores, then said through its muffling mask, “The Mazid’s smell is on him.” There was no hint of menace in the child’s words—it was merely a statement of fact. 
“Yes,” said the scribe, thoughtfully. He turned to address the soldier who’d captured Mandri. “The young master told you to fetch the Mazid’s body, not some outland poke playing at a Mazid’s Minder.”
“Yes sir. Yes, sirs.” 
The soldier saluted again, then ran back towards the rubble.
“And you,” the scribe said to Mandri, “I don’t suppose I’ll find your hand in the Mazid’s body, will I? You’ve committed a grave desecration. The Law affords you an opportunity to repent of your crimes, but I don’t suppose you’ll take it.”
“I, uh—”
“Very well,” the scribe said without giving Mandri a chance to finish the thought. “You shall be delivered to the nearest Lord and sold into slavery. Someone take him away.”
“Hold on!” Mandri whined. “Now, hold on. I haven’t done anything.”
“Oh, you haven’t, have you?” the scribe said, clearly amused.
“I’m an honest Jandri man,” said Mandri. “The people in that rock stole me outside of Meskalim three days ago. I am their prisoner.”
“A prisoner?” The scribe said, and his incredulity slid naturally into a skeptical, chubby-cheeked chortle. The man then leaned over to address the Mazidariga to ensure the child had the correct interpretation of Mandri’s words.
“This is what we call outland bluster. He is no doubt an outlaw like the rest of them.”
“Is he?” the Riga croaked.
“Indeed he is. He is a liar. We shall keep him along with the other liar so they may be dealt the liar’s punishment.”
The scribe nodded to a nearby soldier, who then dragged Mandri to his feet and led him behind the Hrkan line to where Seb was being held. 
Seb was so caked in the dust of Minting Rock’s collapse that she looked like a mangled root just dug up from the earth. Though her frown was unreal, she looked surprised to see Mandri. She did not speak a word of acknowledgment.
“Right then,” said the scribe. “Time to clean this mess up.” 
The Hrkan horn sounded out and the soldiers lurched forwards into a ridiculous march, a heel-stomping strut, and they looked proud to do it, as if the Hrkan Lords themselves were watching. The scribe and Mazidariga walked in front, while both Mandri and Seb were forced at sword point to keep close behind. Soon the Hrkan soldiers came to a halt and spread out into a skirmishing line, giving Mandri a clean view of the corpse of Minting Rock.
The structure, having split in two and fallen apart, now formed two halves of an impromptu arena, with the rubble on either side rising step-like into the air, complete with dead spectators oozing out between the cracks of pancaked floors. Staged on the arena below was the giant Ayram. He stood resolute with four dead Hrks at his feet, one with his nose smashed flat against his skull, another with his face opened up completely. It seemed that Ayram had the beautician’s impulse for rearrangement, as well as a madman’s taste—he seemed to believe that a man’s face was more pleasing to the eye if it were parted down the middle and hanging down around the shoulders.
Behind Ayram, crouching up on rocks like black-scratchers fleeing an incoming tide, were three of his band—Moto, the old witch Elrahet, and Moteah.
The scribe stepped forth to address them all.
“The battle is over,” he said, projecting a firm and commanding tone. “Lay down your weapons and submit yourselves to the Law.”
The scribe clearly bore no actual expectation that the Ayramun would surrender. This was a formality, and formalities were honored because formality was what separated civilized men from the animals. The difference between a slaughter and the exercise of justice was whether or not it was preceded by an announcement. If one announces what they’re going to do, whatever happens next is the victim’s fault. 
The scribe rolled his shoulders back, puffed out his chest and said, “Since you have chosen life outside of the natural laws which govern all mankind, you will be dealt with according to the law of beasts. You shall be captured and sold in the court of the Great Lord Hababeen. If you persist in your barbarity, we shall undress your weight with a dull blade and feed your trimmings to pigs.”
The scribe’s chubby cheeks spread into a frown, as if he weren’t pleased to be issuing his threat—this was also a formality. Mandri had met his fair share of scribes assigned to posts in the Sand, and to a man they were all perverted. The strange bureaucracy that surrounds the culling of outland folk attracts them, and the closer they held to the letter of the law, the more perverse was the performance, and the more satisfaction they got from pulling out the pokes.
The scribe motioned for both Mandri and Seb to be brought to him.
 “Toss your weapon onto the ground,” he said to Ayram, “Or all of you shall be carved to the bone, beginning with these two skulking cowards.”
Ayram planted the chisel-tip of his giant iron spear into the sand, but he did not loosen his grip.
The scribe grabbed Mandri by the scruff. “Let it be known that the course of law was offered and was rejected.” 
He pulled a short knife from his robe and raised it up so all could see.
“I say one last time—toss your weapon! The light of the law demands it!”
He lowered the knife to meet Mandri’s throat.
Ayram looked like an ancient outland idol cloaked in the dust of untamed earth and anointed with the blood of weaker creatures. Mandri watched with bated breath as this wildman decided whether or not to surrender to a frail-backed, skinny-fat scribe. Yes, there were Skulsi here too, but never in all the turns of the world could such a man surrender to such a man.
Mandri felt an urge to do something to save his neck, and this desperate urge was overwhelming, it clawed itself out of his stomach regardless of whether or not it was welcome in the world. He squirmed—he knew not why but he squirmed under the scribe’s firm grip. He could feel the man’s fingers sense his desperation. Mandri squirmed, and he was so unused to this urge’s working on him that it passed through him all too easily, too quickly, so that instead of coiling him up and unleashing a twist of fury, what came out of his body was a sneeze—a sneeze with snot and spittle—and it came bursting out to fleck the knife and hand of the Hrkan scribe.
ACHOO!
The scribe recoiled in horror at the sight of the flag of snot dripping down the meat of his thumb. “You disgusting poke!” he screamed. He made to wipe it off on Mandri’s robe, but before he could, Ayram’s spear slammed into his chest.
The scribe was thrown back by force. A rasping howl issued from his throat as the spear slid halfway through him and pinned him to the sand like a skewered pig.
Ayram had thrown the damn thing. He’d thrown it over thirty yards and hit his target square in the chest. And he wasn’t done—he sprinted towards the Hrkan line, roaring like the beast the scribe had named him.
The white cloaked Skulsi closed rank.
Mandri didn’t know what to expect next, but it certainly wasn’t the sight of Ayram leaping over the line of swinging Hrkan swords. The giant came tumbling down behind them and rolled into a run. Five strides later he was standing over the scribe’s corpse. He reclaimed his spear. From there, he turned on the converging Hrkan Skulsi and swung.
Ayram wielded his spear as efficiently as Mandri could handle a brush—a tight economy of strokes. Twenty-something Hrkan men he had to kill, Hrkan Skulsi no less, veterans of battles with bulging calves from all the marching, with manly beards and mule-kicked brows, faces to fear—how many swings of a spear should it take to bring down such a number? Surely the giant would have to waste a twirl or two to parry the swarm of blows arrayed against him. Fifty? If not fifty, then twenty? Mandri might have believed twenty if someone had told him the story secondhand.
His disbelieving eyes counted ten.
Ten strokes to kill at least twenty hardscrabble soldiers. Ten powerful strokes. And it wasn’t like Mandri would do in a portrait, where he’d make mistakes and wipe them away until he got it right—there was no room for error here, every sweeping stroke was deliberate and precise. Every swing had to solve at least two problems at once. Truly, these bloody, gut-ripping marks were the marks of genius. 
When it was over, Mandri wondered why any of it was necessary in the first place. It seemed Ayram could slaughter the world and none would stop him. But when the last white cloak fell, Ayram dropped to his knees. There was a long bloody gash running down his ribs. He had not been perfect, if perfection was such a thing.
The giant drew a shaky breath and called for Moto. Moto came running, and as he approached he offered aid, but shooed him away and said, “Kill the rat.”
At first, Mandri thought Ayram was talking about him, then he thought Ayram was referring to Seb. Then Moto went sprinting past them both to chase after the Mazidariga child, who was running away into the empty desert, running as fast as his little legs could carry him.</Text>

and her hair was as wild as  a weedbush puffing out of the wide black bandanna that she’d affixed to her forehead. The red kell oil smeared on her face picked up the warm light and made it seem as if her cheeks were rubbed raw, down to the bleeding muscle.

It was a metallic, tinny tone that quivered like a strandtail’s warble, only it was ten times louder and harsher than any shriek any bird could ever make. That damned sound cut through the rock so clearly that its source might as well have been in the room. For Mandri, it was an ear-splitting pain, but to Obo it was doing something stranger.

“I don’t know.”

            <Title>Goree Pass</Title>
            <Text>The story of the curse upon the Goree Pass was one of Mandri’s favorite stories. An ancient tribe called the Solgruin asked Solraheen to split the Goree mountain so that the overland journey east would be made easier. Solraheen, walked to the mountains and climbed the tallest peak where he stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
He said to the petitioners, “Look upon this scar which mars My creation and hate your selfish ways. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed and so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
For Mandri, this story justified the act of ripping up a painting to spite a client, just as Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin.
He’d only ever done it once, but what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a week and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the barbarian King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would go to her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a proto-Hrkan Lord on the richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, “That looks just like your Pookum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Pookum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with resentment. As his fingers tore the canvas an unfamiliar euphoria coursed through his veins. He tore the painting completely in half, right there in front of that cursed woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have killed that woman, just as Solraheen killed all those who journeyed the Goree Pass. Well, He didn’t kill them, He cursed them. Curses, it turns out, does little to dissuade people. After all, here they were, the Ayramun, Mandrameen himself, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the pass.
According to Moto, the Greskalun made their home inside the pass itself.
Either there was no curse and the story was only a story, or maybe the Solitants were right about not taking the surface meaning too seriously. Or, and this is what Moto believed, the curse was only meant for the Solgruin. Everyone else could do what they want.
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, further out was the black sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib from spreading out of control. 
The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen’s spite became, for the ground under Mandri’s feet grew uneven, and rocks popped up out of the sand like roots to trip him. The Goree’s walls grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground. These cracks had long been rubbed smooth, an eon of blasting sand had rounded their edges, pillowed the seams, giving them the appearance of bloated infection. Mandri’s bright mood dimmed at the sight of them—it was quite apparent that the place was truly cursed. 
Soon the Goree Pass was sighted in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree’s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Ayram informed the rest that this splinter was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the breadth of the pass’s mouth, protecting against ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now, and had done so for centuries.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through a debris field from a mountain cleft exploding.
The scattered boulders were indeed a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been indescribable. It would have been unbelievable if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Solraheen standing up there on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the dusty wind, and, well, a god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe to set the mountains quaking and bursting, sending stones the size of houses miles into the air. A long sliver of the mountain reduced to rubble and vomited out onto the desert plain in the blink of an eye.
Most of the Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram walked with a bowed head, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
Purl was ashen-faced and whispering to herself.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, like his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—angry and quiet.
Meanwhile Seb was chewing his borcandi spines so hard that his jaw was going stiff and he had to sort of rub them between his teeth instead of chew. And the man wasn’t paying attention to where he was spitting his juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, he hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted himself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Don’t you disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me disrespect you?”
“You threaten a man with his kneecaps, that’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“It was an accident!”
“And I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He doubled back to make sure he was listened to.
Both men’s backs went stiff.
Ayram said sternly, “Nobody talks from here on out. Except Elrahet.”
Mandri asked, “So the Hrks are coming today?”
“I said nobody talks.”
Ayram’s deep voice rumbled Mandri to his core, but Obo was not so affected. He added, from behind Mandri’s ear, “Oh, the Hrks will be on us today, I’m sure.”
“You can sense the Hrks?” Ayram asked, startled. “They’re here?”
“I can, but the Hrks aren’t who you should be worried about. It’s the Greskalun. Something’s happened to them.”
“The creature seeks to stall us,” Elrahet grumbled.
Ayram’s grave visage lingered on Obo a moment, then he muttered a curse under his breath and he set off again towards the pass, this time more cautiously, peeking out from behind boulders, and climbing upon them to look for the Hrks behind them. 
By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. He could not shake this foreboding feeling that this once living mountain was now dead and rotted through. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock because they were as friable as the hardtack Mandri was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased—when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against a boulder, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the stone were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread. And then there was the black tower itself, poking out like a splinter stuck in a wound.
An uneasiness had settled in amongst them ever since Obo’s grim pronouncement. Mandri wasn’t worried as much about the Greskalun, for him, his fear stemmed from the tower. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower.
And It was black. No bright Spark ever builds in black.
And the central task of a monument to some grave sin is to look like it doesn’t belong. The tall spike of a tower did this quite comfortably.
Mandri thought he’d die on the approach, for the brittle rock slopes threatened to come galloping down upon him every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks. Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by their invisible Hrkan pursuit. He pioneered a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo without seeing him, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered for making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof that Obo was wrong about ‘something happening’ to the Greskalun. 
Then the Goree pass opened up before them.
The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle, and to either side, black stone walls sprawled across the red-stone gap. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s mouth, though the gate in the tower’s base was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that Obo was right—something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off towards the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb said, “Maybe they all retreated into their temple.” Seb was so stressed out that he was chewing two spines at once and his words were garbled by a slosh of spit.
“Retreated from what?” Moteah asked.
“I don’t know,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Purl.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “That could be it! It’s happened before, right? That’s what they do whene the pox gets on them, they run back into their temple and stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.” 
“I don’t think we should go in,” Purl said. She then stated the obvious, “It’s cursed.”
Mandri said, “You guys know the story about how the Goree Pass was created, right?”
“Yes, we know,” Moteah groaned.
“I wasn’t sure. It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since forever.”
“It’s not cursed,” said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows.
As if to prove him wrong, a black vulture, which had been hiding in the shadow of the tower’s pointed roof, squawked and took flight. It spread its long wings and soared, caught a thermal, and rode it high up into the air, where it wheeled around in circles.
“It’s only a bird,” Ayram muttered.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and wheeled up into the air. They joined their brother’s holding pattern, and their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient curse.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Seb, “Then the Hrkan Lords woulda choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The mood was affecting even Ayram. The strongest men are perhaps the most frightened by magic. A curse from a god was not something he could kill with his spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion of his control.
The giant marched over to Mandri, and Mandri flinched, fearing he’d done or said something wrong. 
“Take off your pack,” Ayram grumbled. Mandri did as he was told and swung Obo’s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it, set it down, and he squatted next to it so he could get a good clear look at Obo’s face. He said, “Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?” There was no room in his tone for games.
“No,” said Obo.
Ayram growled a disbelieving grunt. 
Obo said, “You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. I know you outland pokes abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when—”
“The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.”
“If you are asking me if there’s a small army of Hrkan Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. But I do think your instincts are correct—what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter.”
Seb spat in Obo’s general direction. The loogie just missed Obo’s litter and splatted harmlessly in the dirt. “Them Greskalun could still be those mountains. Pox, or drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” said Moteah.
“Or maybe not,” Obo said, suggesting he knew better. Instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter, his elbows stretching his swaddling fabric as he twisted around. Mandri couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight of it—he looked like a toddler trying to roll over, trying to get comfortable for a nap. With effort, Obo poked the stub of his arm up and out of the neck of his tightly wrapped robe, and he used it to widen the opening so that he could stick his whole handless arm through. Once done, he reached out behind him and nudged something into view. It was a bone.
“Where did you get that?” Moteah asked.
“It was sitting here,” said Obo. “Not the first one I’ve seen. Honestly, I’m surprised you all missed it.”
Obo pushed the bone out before him, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.
“This,” said Obo, “Is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.”
Seb stomped over and nudged it with his toe. “You find one bone and you think them dead? One bone on the ground? A bone on the ground ain’t unusual. Where else are you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Let the Mazid speak,” said Ayram.
Obo nudged the bone so that it flipped over. “This is an unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
He rubbed his pale, nubby wrist along the length of the fracture. It wasn’t a clean fracture, it was a splintered fracture which stretched almost along the whole length of it, leaving the upturned half to look like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unimpressed.
“Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that’s how bones naturally break. A break like this—it’s not likely to happen accidentally.”
Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing paws the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “If your point is that this person was killed, that’s not unusual.”
“I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the pass,” Mandri said.
“We’re not in the pass,” Ayram said.
Obo shrugged and said, “Whoever it was, however they died, that’s not what is significant. This was no simple killing. A blow to the leg would not crack the bone like that. It could happen, but the chances of that occurring are exceedingly slim.”
“Get on with it,” Ayram grumbled.
“I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri ruin. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating other people. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone up so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with images of a cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his teeth. Ayram held the bone out away from him as if it were diseased and the thirst for flesh could rub off on him like a plague.
Elrahet waddled over and yanked the bone from the giant’s grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the open socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone onto the sand, right in front of Obo.
“Look!” shouted Purl. She was pointing towards the tower. Moto was sprinting out of the tower’s gate back towards them, running at full speed, frenetic, as if he were being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust in the wide mouth of the empty pass. When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!” He looked over his shoulder and grimaced.
“Pick up the Mazid,” Ayram said to Mandri, and with that it was decided—Ayram would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower and its gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled, and bowing every so slightly out. Bricks bulged, some were twisted, some seem to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The gate underneath it was ten-men wide, and its arch was fanged by metal teeth which hung ominously above Ayram’s head. The tunnel itself was as large as the hall of the Hrkan prince, big enough to turn the sound of Ayram’s iron spear thumping against the hard dirt ground into an echo. Aside from this metronomic beat, they passed through this dark in silence, casting wary glances at each large door frames that pocketed either side of the gate’s long tunnel.
Moto stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and a shadow of shadows passed over his dark face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it.
All around, stuck out of the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly and twice taller than Ayram. Wrapped around them were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
It was a desecration.
Such was the defilement that curses leapt into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. The horror robbed him of his sense of the future, and it sent his stomach into a terrible, growling fit.
The nearest wretch was some ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant pilgrim. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, lolling in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of god.
They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor Sparks littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.
Obo, with the use of his newly freed arm, hauled himself up onto Mandri’s shoulder to see for himself.
Mandri muttered, “I guess we know what happened to the Greskalun.”
Obo agreed. “They must have gone insane,” he said. “I did not know one could hate a pilgrim this deeply.”
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. 
Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. 
Purl sank to her knees, half in prayer, half in buckling despair. 
Seb, a man who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. 
The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil presence of the scene for she had not made it through the tunnel. She was sitting inside its shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye back at his mournful band.
He said, “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, but I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into his skin. Seb said, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? Besides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em ‘cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’.”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as he gestured at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.
“Moteah’s right,” she said, and her gravelly voice stunned them all back into silence. “Greskal would never do a thing like this.”
Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the darkness of the tunnel after her. Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up, leaning on her walking stick. If before her verve was waning, it was now well and truly gone. She walked towards the courtyard with a hobbling hitch that was not there before.
“They must have sensed the panic,” she said.
It seemed all her joints were aching as she lurched onwards. It was as if every long year of her life was suddenly set upon her.
“Not just Greskal’s panic, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets their stomachs growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light of the courtyard and surveyed the carnage with a hateful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? You have sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long that you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I can tell when someone has pissed themselves, if that’s what you’re asking?”
“PANIC!” Elrahet roared. “Panic sets their stomachs growling. Panic wakes them up.”
“Wakes who up?” Seb asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled to reveal a snaggletoothed grin.
“Demons,” she said.
The word zipped past Mandri’s ear like an arrow aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“This was demons that did this,” Elrahet declared.
“You’re talking about, demon demons?” Mandri asked.
“Is there any other kind?”
Ayram, still composed, said, “We’ll do what we can for them, then we leave.”
Seb raised voice and declared, “There ain’t nothin’ we can do for ‘em!”
“He’s right,” said Elrahet. “First time in his dumb life, but he’s right. There’s nothing we can do for these people.”
“Dead is dead,” Seb said.
“Oh, they aren’t dead,” said Elrahet with a sneer.
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim, and what he saw was death. Death was becoming a familiar sight to him, and he’d seen enough to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive. 
Purl said, “We should do what we can for them.”
“We could kill them,” said Moto. “That would put an end to this.”
Elrahet sighed and said, “Their very Sparks are bound to the poles. Death, for them, is impossible.” She stamped her impatience into the ground with her cane and repeated, “We must leave at once.”
With that she turned and began to hobble back into the tunnel.
Moto was the first to follow. Then Ayram and Purl. Mandri joined them in the shadow of the tower and was glad to be gone from that courtyard.
“Hold on,” Seb said. “We’re goin’ back!? What about the Greskalun?” He pointed with a jabbing, open hand towards the Goree pass, as if the Greskalun were right there and Elrahet only had to squint a little to see them.
Moteah brushed past him and said, “There are no Greskalun.”
Seb stood his ground. “You can’t know that ‘til we go and have a look! We at least got to try.”
“There’s demons!” said Moto.
“Can’t be worse than Hrks.”
As soon as the words had left his mouth, there came from the distant west a sharp and roaring bleat—the Hrkan horn of war.
BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooo
The call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and there in the far distance was a horse and rider, galloping around from the right, around the sprawling tumble of the Pass’s shattered stones.
The horse, white as bone, came stumbling to a stop and reared up almost to the point of no control. The rider, little more than a speck so far away, was a man as dark as Moto and clad in the familiar blue robe of a Hrkan scribe. He shouted a command to his beast to settle it down, and all the while his face was trained on the tunnel where Mandri and the Ayramun stood.
Seb was already fleeing. He was halfway up into the pass proper when he stopped and waved for everyone to follow.
“Damnit, come on!” he urged.
No one moved save for Ayram, who unshouldered his great pack and tossed it to the floor.
Though the scribe was far away, all could see that in his hand was a sword, for he held it high, and the silver blade and golden guard caught the glare of the pre-noon sun. He barked some indiscernible word, and then, with a sweeping flourish, threw his sword onto the sand.
Moto saw the scribe’s sign and gaped in disbelief. “He wants to bargain?”
The Hrkan horn sounded out again.
BWEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooooooo
From around the Pass’s northern shelf came a column of white robed soldiers. At their head was a small child robed in black—the Mazidariga. They spread out into a line just behind the scribe.
Purl asked everyone, “What do we do?”
Obo perked up and said, “That Riga out there could have whistled out my will-less Spark by now, but it hasn’t. Those soldiers could be charging towards this tower, but they aren’t. There’s not much to read into this—these people actually mean to bargain.”
Moto asked, “Why?”
“The same reason anyone bargains—they think they have something to lose.”
Moteah said, “Maybe they think the Greskalun are here and on our side.”
“Your guess is as good as mine,” said Obo.
“Stay here, and stay hidden,” said Ayram. “I’m going to see what they want.”
He began to march through the tunnel and out of the gate, spear gripped tightly in hand. The Hrkan scribe, upon seeing Ayram marching out into the Sand, set his horse to trotting towards the tower.
Ayram paused a few yards outside the tower’s gate, forcing the scribe to cross the greater distance.
When the horse and rider finally neared the giant, Ayram laid down his spear. And though the scribe was high in his a saddle, they met almost eye to eye.
“Are you Greskal?” The rider asked, impressed at Ayram’s size.
“I am not.”
The answer took the scribe by surprise.
“Are you the master of this tower?”
Ayram glanced behind him and said, “This tower has no master. As you can see, it is empty, save for me and mine.”
The scribe’s horse was becoming fidgety. No doubt it had caught wind of the terror that lay in the courtyard. The scribe mistook it for fright at Ayram’s height.
The stern man said, “We know that the Mazidobo resides in this tower.”
“So it does,” said Ayram. 
“Then bring it forth. I wish to speak with it.”
“You can speak with me,” said Ayram gruffly. “I will pass your message along.”
The scribe frowned. “This is not the time for games,” he warned. “We found the body of the Mazidariga of Shuls out in the desert.”
“Is that so?”
“Tell me, has the Mazidobo lost its flame? We saw no scorch marks.”
“You are welcome to test that interpretation, should you wish.”
The scribe sneered and said, “We know the Mazidobo has acquired some means of reversing the Mazidariga’s charm. We know that it escaped the leash of his Minder. We wish to come to terms with it, so as to avoid any further loss of life.”
The scribe’s horse was growing more perturbed by the moment. Its eyes were wide and its nostrils flared and it kept trying to resettle its rider, as if preparing to bolt.
“Tell the Mazidobo, that as we speak, a battalion of Hrkan Skulsi marches into the eastern mouth of the Goree Pass. At their head is the Mazidurn. Behind me, as you can see, is a column of swords, and coming up from the south, from the Solgi, is the Mazidban, who shall be with us shortly. As such, you are all surrounded, and should it come to it, you will be overwhelmed. There is no way out excepting the event in which you and yours peaceably disarm yourselves, and the Mazidobo offers itself up into my charge. In exchange, all lives will all be spared, and the Mazidobo shall be allowed to retire from service after submitting to examination. We do not need violence here, nor do we want it. More than anything, we want the Mazidobo alive, for we wish to learn from its malfunction.”
“I don’t much like those terms,” Ayram said.
The scribe frowned and his horse bucked slightly, sharing its rider’s frustration.
“This is not a matter for you to decide,” the scribe said. “Bring my terms to the Mazidobo, or bring the Mazidobo and I’ll tell it myself.”
Ayram stroked his beard. He looked up at the sky, arced his shoulders, and he drew in a breath that could fill an ox’s stomach, enough air to think for a good long while. In the intervening silence, the scribe’s horse began to clip-clop its agitation, bouncing the scribe uncomfortably in his saddle.
“Settled down you crooked beast!”
He gave his horse a foul kick in the ribs.
Ayram finally said, “The Mazid and its Minder will only treat with their own kind.”
“The Mazidobo’s Minder is dead. His body was found two weeks ago in the Junei hills.”
“The Mazid has a new Minder. An old witch.”
The scribe’s brow jumped in surprise, and that quickly turned into elation. He mused, “That’s good. An unleashed Mazid would be no good for any of us. But if it will only speak to a Mazid, then we will have to wait, for the Mazidban will not be here for at least another hand.”
Ayram said, “The Mazidobo will treat with the Mazidariga.” He nodded towards the Hrkan line behind the scribe.
The scribe bit his lip in frustration. He looked up, took in the tower, then spied the long distance behind him.
“Fine,” he said. “But I won’t do this business in the shadow of this accursed place. We’ll meet where the tower’s shadow meets the light of Solraheen.”
With the sun approaching its noontime zenith, the tower’s shadow extended out into the desert a mere forty yards or so.
“Fair enough,” said Ayram.
Before the scribe and his horse ran off, he said,  “There’s no sense in playing me, poke. There’s nowhere to run if you resort to trickery.”
Ayram picked up his spear. The scribe sneered, then barked at his horse and yanked on the reins as he jabbed its flanks with his heels. Off they went galloping, back towards the Hrkan line.  
Ayram spun around, and nested inside his beard was the biggest of all possible smiles, considering the size of his head.
“Solraheen shines on us!” he declared as he stepped back into the tower’s tunnel. Moto was the first to greet him by saying, “This will be easier than I ever dreamed.”
Ayram nodded and said, “That scribe won’t know what hit him. Can you believe it!? Hrks think they’re gods when they’re stuck up on a horse. Who says the Goree is cursed?”
He marched over to his giant pack, untied the bindings that kept it shut, then lifted it up and dumped its contents on the floor.
“Split this up between you,” he said. “And make sure that everyone is ready to run.”
“Run where?” Seb asked.
Ayram said, “Once I strike that scribe down, we need to run. I’m not going to stop to help any of you get yourselves together, so if you’re not ready, if you fall behind, you’re forgotten.”
Ayram then stepped over to Mandri. He said, “Turn around,” and Mandri turned, and then Ayram pulled Obo out of the litter by his skull again, as if handling a melon.
Obo dangled in Ayram’s grip, looking like a pale worm. He said to Ayram, “You know, I could ruin this for you.”
Ayram’s mood soured at the suggestion.
“I’m not going to ruin it,” Obo said. “I just wanted you all to know that I could have.”
Ayram grunted and tossed Obo onto his emptied pack. Obo’s pale, bald head and bony arm were almost glowing in the tunnel dark, but most of all, his saucer eyes were bright and shining. They scanned the world for something, probably they were looking for something he could use to rescue himself. Mandri knew no rescue was coming and that, for Obo, this might be the end. Then those eyes settled on Mandri, and Mandri felt his stomach knot.
There was nothing he could do for Obo—and yet…and yet…odd that he should feel this way for so strange a face. Some mothers love children with faces much worse off than Obo’s, not that Mandri was feeling something so pure. It was just the sense of pity—Obo was going to be snuffed out for no other reason than he was what he was, and what a shame. Born almost yesterday, enslaved and tortured all his short life, quartered by desert bandits, and he was still holding out hope, still looking at Mandri like Mandri was important. 
Mandri had to look away. But he could not quell the budding sense that something was being uncovered here, and that was horrible, because as any self-watcher knows, finding things out about oneself is the worst kind of finding. And Obo was right there, and this was a permanent goodbye, Mandri knew it. Then that pang of pity came back fierce and welled up in his throat.
He could not speak for fear of sobbing.
He swallowed it down.
He glanced at Obo and the sob of pity rose again.
Then a small miracle occurred.
Seb, in an attempt to reorganize his pack’s interior to make room for a bundle of dried beef, pulled out a woolen blanket, and in so doing, unwittingly pulled out his pouch of burgeons as well. The pouch hit the ground and out popped three beautiful God’s Eye burgeons. Two of them spiraled harmlessly in little circles, but one burgeon hit the ground rolling as if flicked towards Mandri’s toes by Solraheen Himself.
Mandri covered it up with his foot. When Seb finally noticed that his burgeons had spilled, he snatched them up, quick as a fox, none the wiser that he’d missed one.
The feeling of that burgeon under Mandri’s heel was brighter than any morning. Mandri didn’t even hear Obo’s final parting.
“Never let it be said that I didn’t do anything for you people.”
Moto yanked the L-frame litter right off Mandri’s back, because Moto had made a makeshift bag out of a blanket, and he’d filled that bag with the stuff that had tumbled out of Ayram’s pack—liquid skins, knotted ropes and strings, and odd-shaped dried mutton lumps wrapped in linen cloth.
Where had any of that meat been during the long journey through the Tib?
No matter.
There was God’s Eye under his foot.
But even this thought was not enough to last, for when Moto handed the litter back to Mandri, it was twice the weight that Obo ever was.</Text>

            <Title>Togetherness</Title>
            <Text>The moment the red sun’s bottom lip kissed the west, Ayram set out into the Sand. He never announced it was time to leave or that everyone should think about heading out, he simply gathered up his enormous backpack and started off.
Mandri didn’t notice Ayram walk off because he was engrossed by the colors in the sky, which were darkening into an unusual reddish tint. It was a shade he’d only seen in rotting berries. The whole sky was flush with this startling purplish red, he followed the gradient arc around to the east, and there, suddenly, some hundred yards away, was Ayram—a giant lumbering towards a featureless horizon. Beyond Ayram was a much smaller black dot named Seb. Seb had set out even earlier after complaining about how slow everyone was and that he was going to do what he wanted to do. Nobody tried to stop him.
When Elrahet was good and ready to leave, she told Moto to bring the cursed Mazid with him, and she waddled, packless, out into the Sand. Moto turned to Purl and said, “You heard the woman, bring the Mazid with you,” and then he jogged off after the others. The clank of iron and wood inside his own heavy pack was his teasing laughter.
Mandri waited. When Moteah started out, he got up to follow, but was stopped when Moteah said, “Where are you going? You’re carrying the Mazid.”
Mandri moved to gather Obo up, but Purl shooed him away, and said, “Wait.” She wasn’t done staring at the Mazid, who at this point had been gagged by a gray rag. Mandri could hardly guess at what she was trying to do, so instead he sat down on a bump of Minting Rock’s rubble, hands idle, and studied her features.
Purl fit the standard rule of thumb for beauty that’s taught to artists at an early age—don’t make too many marks. People start to look ugly if one makes too many marks to bring out the features. If Mandri were to paint Purl with as few marks as possible, he wouldn’t be lying all that much, for the redding light of the oncoming night was flattening her red, kell-oiled skin. A few soft swoops would capture the sheen of the sky as it defined her high arched cheeks and the youthfulness of her lips, and that was almost it.
But if one sits and stares at another human being for long enough, the features of the face start to lose the illusion that they’re working together for a purpose. It doesn’t matter how attractive the person is, because everyone has ugly things about them.
Purl had ears. Peeking out underneath her sun-licked, frazzled bush of wiry hair were tiny ears. Mandri hated ears, those odd, fleshy protuberances. It’s as if, when Solraheen was creating people, He took a wad of clay, crumpled it up, and then slapped it onto the side of the head expecting to come back to it later to make it work but never did.
Everyone has breath—that’s not quite part of one’s physical appearance, but the breath! If there was ever a sign of what a person is, it is the stench of breath. Cover it up with a swig of acidic pango juice, but that never lasts last long. Little wonder that Jeket has a whole market square dedicated to tinctures and chews that are supposed to suppress the smell of the curdled things hiding in between the teeth, or pasting the tongue, or tucked into tonsil folds. 
But ignore all that.
Get down to the basics.
Study the structure of the face.
There is not one person alive whose face is symmetrical. There is always, always, some feature which started growing in the wrong direction as a child and kept going with age. Or maybe it didn’t grow fast enough to keep up with the rest when puberty hit. Titled noses. Slanted jaws. Most common is the uneven eyes, or uneven eyebrows. Sometimes the whole face swivels around to one side, and so one cheek gets slapped more than the other. Or it was smushed that way as the head squeezed out of the womb and it stuck, leaving the mentioned with a lopsided smile.
The only parts of the body Mandri liked to look at were the ones he generally wasn’t allowed to look at—a cosmic cruelty, but one he didn’t fret about, because the only reason he liked to look at those bits was because he wasn’t allowed to. He used to be fascinated by the sparkling eye, but his brush spent so much time nibbling them them that they’d lost their charm. They were nothing but squishy wet orbs squelching around in their sockets. And as it is for outer beauty, so it is for inner beauty as well. Mandri was certain that if he got close enough to Purl, that if he got a whiff of her breath, so to speak, then the illusion that she was something kind, or cherished, something more than a walking, talking sack of Sparked meat would crumble. 
Still, she had no obvious tells. Her hawkish features were tailor made for frowning, which was Mandri’s preference—a frowning, serious woman. She was even frowning right now. She stood, hands and nub on hips, that timeless pose of the woman waiting for an idiot, and she was frowning.
She was frowning at him.
“Uh, what?” he asked.
“You’re carrying the Mazid,” she said.
Mandri said, “Alright,” and then he stood up, and walked over to where Obo was resting. Obo had a gag tied over his mouth.
Purl said, “Use the frame.”
There was a wooden, L-shaped frame fitted with straps sitting next to Obo. It was the same device morning walkers used to haul sacks of grain to work off drought debt. Mandri tied Obo into it. The frame was the perfect size for Mandri’s scrawny back, and it had a waist strap that pulled fast around his stomach, and that kept Obo’s weight resting kindly on top of his hips. He bounced up and down to test its weight, and was delighted to find that his chewed-up leg had made a remarkable recovery.
“Thought he’d be heavier,” Mandri said.
“If you can carry more...”
“Oh, no. No. It’s more than heavy enough.” Mandri made a show of shifting the weight on his shoulders. Purl’s own pack was a huge, canvas wrapped lump in the shape of a bean, with the head of it looming against the upward puff of her hair.
“How far is it,” Mandri asked.
“The Bullr basin lies a hundred miles east of here.”
“One hundred miles? That far?”
Purl’s response was to start walking.
Mandri followed after her. “That’s what, ten days?”
“It depends on Ayram,” she said. “Ten days for him would be slow. Have you ever walked for ten days straight?”
“No.”
He looked to see if they were following one of the old charnel roads. If it was there he couldn’t see it, as there was no gentle hump in the earth stretching off into the horizon. It was flat, and even flatter further on.
Mandri returned to the subject of Purl’s ugliness—her inner ugliness. He hadn’t seen it yet, but was determined to find it out, and an easy way to capture a thing like that was to ambush it. He waited for her to settle into the inertia of the journey, and then pounced.
“What’s wrong with you?”
“Excuse me?”
“It seems like there’s something wrong with you.”
She shrugged and moped along, staring at the ground. He wondered if she had been mulling over that very question right before he’d asked it.
“Too many things,” she said, and Mandri felt a little shame as she fussed with the tangles in her hair with her one good hand. He’d only been looking for threads to pull and she was about to hand him a ball of yarn.
“But what kind of question is that?” She asked. “You know, it’s a good thing that you’re out here.”
“Why is that?”
“Because the Sand is going to lick your spit until you’re dry.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“Oh, you’ll find out.”

“So what’s this about a killing this demon of demons?”
“You mean the Amalgamete?”
“Yeah.”
“How much do you know about the death cults Schisol has seeded in the Sand?”
“Schisol?”
“You’ve never heard of the god of all destruction.”

If you had a Spark, what would you do with it? 
I honestly don’t know. I have my wants, but I think if I had a Spark, my wants would change.
I think you would.
For the same reason Mandri has’t left yet.
“I’m allowed to leave?”
Then give me a Spakr.
I can’t.
I thought Elrahet said.
“I can’t.”

Mandri asked, “Am I allowed to leave?”
Her grin crept wide and she nodded, and her hair brushed up against her bean-bag backpack. “You’ve always been allowed to leave. But you haven’t and you won’t.”
“I haven’t had the opportunity.”
“That’s not why,” she said with confidence. She then stopped walking and pointed off to her right, to an isolated patch of nearby scrub bush. Zooming around the tousled branches was a swarm of pinprick dots. There were so many tiny flies that it looked like the bush had a misty, black aura.
“Only Solraheen knows how many hook flies there are,” she said. “Flies can go anywhere—they can walk along the ground, they can fly in every direction, they can explore the entire world and see sights unseen—but they don’t. They hover in that small, boring spot of air out here in the desert. You know why?”
“Why?” Mandri asked, bracing himself for a bit of folksy outland wisdom.
“Hook flies swarm like that because even though the world is vast and beautiful, the most interesting thing in it is each other.”
Purl gave Mandri a considerate smile of unquestionable sincerity. Then she resumed her journey, leaving Mandri standing stock still, looking at those stupid flies.
Like most figures of speech, Purl’s analogy had a surface charm that suggested a deeper truth, but it completely broke down upon further investigation. Those flies weren’t flying around in a ball because of the fulfillment they received from some exciting sense of togetherness. There were more primal interests at play. Maybe they’d found water there in that bush, or food, or the bush broke the breeze making it easier to fly in the first place. Most likely it was about sex. They bunch up into a cloud like that because it is the easiest way to bump their stiff little uglies into something that makes them feel alive. Maybe one could say that still lines up with Purl’s notion of togetherness, but Mandri didn’t get the feeling that’s what she meant. In fact, these Ayramun were the least lascivious group of people he’d ever known—he’d not seen a single lip-licking wink between any of them, and he had been looking carefully.
She called back to him, “Don’t fall behind!”
He called back, “I have to pee.”
Purl hiked her bean pack further up on her shoulders and continued on. Her pack was so large that it had its own momentum, and she had to move slowly and build up speed until the pack’s forward motion began to sustain itself.
The very moment she was out of whisper range, Obo started wiggling around in his seat, and he issued a muffled plea to have his gag removed. Mandri groaned and reached back and slipped the knot keeping Obo’s gag fastened tight.
“Isn’t she interesting,” said Obo.
“Not really,” said Mandri, lying. “What makes you say that?”
“I think they’re a death cult.”
“A death cult?” Mandri asked, concerned.
Obo’s bright voice was threaded with excitement as he explained. “They match the pattern—the way they handled those giant corpses inside of Minting Rock, and the way they gathered up those who fell in battle, Hrk and Ayramun alike, into one big pile. Most would keep them separate.”
“That pile of bodies was supposed to be a sphere,” said Mandri as he recalled the back-breaking work he’d done to haul those rocks around.
“That fits. Compress them all into a tight ball, for in death all Sparks will be joined together.”
“Killing everyone would bring peace on earth, wouldn’t it?”
Suddenly, Mandri had to pee. As he relieved himself, a small brown lizard came crawling out of the sand to lick at the beads of urine that splashed down.
He said, “But if they want everything to die, then why bring me back to life? Why free Solraheen?”
“I don’t know.”
“How many Ayramun did they start out with? Fifty?”
“I believe it was forty-three.”
Mandri scanned the horizon—it was wide open space in every direction. There weren’t any hills to hide behind, but the shadows behind every bush were dark as Fabled Black.
He said, “What do you say to walking off in a different direction?”
“You may be allowed to leave, but I doubt they’ll be happy if you take me with you. I think the correct decision is to continue on.”
Mandri wiggled his member and dropped his robe.
“Let it be said that I think this is a bad idea.”</Text>
            <Notes>You think that’s what they’re trying to do - free schisol?

Mandri doesn’t like whats’ happening to her.

Need to rework intro to make it a SCENE

A number of things can happen after a question like that.
Mopey people, like Mandri, might find no offense and immediately jump in to listing everything they hate about themselves. 
Arrogant people, like Mandri, might take extreme offense, especially if they think they’re better than the person asking the question—‘What’s wrong with me? What’s wrong with you!?’
Considerate people, like Purl, gave the question more credit than it was worth. She would assume that Mandri was observant and that he had some specific fault in mind, when in reality he was only looking for threads to pull.</Notes>

            <Title>Inciting Incidents</Title>
            <Text>Writing query letters for two ‘new normals’
Seems to be a common thing where Inciting incident A.) recruited into task vs. B.) task is revealed to be wildly different than imagined.
E.G.
&gt;My protagonist is a skilled thief who lives on a small island committing petty crimes. His father is the leader of the thieves guild there. One day, a group comes looking for a thief to pull off a nearly impossible task, and they kill the protagonist's father and kidnap him and his friend in order to make him comply. 
&gt; The job this group wants him for involves stealing from the book's &quot;big bad&quot;, the main antagonist. When he goes to do this task, he learns of [a macguffin] that the antagonist has the coordinates for, and also manages to get himself caught by the antagonist, and captured once again, now by this different, more powerful group.  who are ALSO searching for [the macguffin], which turns out to be incredibly important and can't fall into the hands of the antagonist. This is where the meat of the story begins, as the protagonist is caught between wanting to help find this thing to prevent the world's destruction, but also needing to rescue his still kidnapped friend.

Yup. The inciting incident is when your character gets punched in the mouth, and the first plot point is their choice to fight back. Or run. Or call the police. Or give their attacker a hug. 

&gt; The story follows a girl who has supernatural powers. The first inciting incident happens at the end of chapter one where she meets someone who tells her she has been poisoned to suppress her powers. This leads her to leave home with the intent of learning to control her powers. But then comes the second inciting incident where her friend is kidnapped and she has to go save her. The second incident is at the 30% mark. 

The second incident sounds like your 'first complication' beat. This is often the point where a new external problem is introduced as an obstacle to the protagonist's goal.

            <Title>Salavan Soreen</Title>
            <Text>The garden holds a sacred place in Solitant cosmology, and so every person who wants to appear distinguished has one. Since Mandri grew up amongst these well-adjusted persons, he’d seen his fair share of gardens. He’d walked under the royal palms of Skinee, and he’d nearly drowned in the terraced falls of Luzee. He’d seen every garden that people brag about seeing, but none of these sights compared to Salavan’s garden, for everyone else’s garden was a thirsty greenscape, accented here and there by vibrant splashes of flower and fruit and split in half by the glow of the atmosphere reflecting off the surface of some placid stream or artificial lake. Salavan’s garden was a garden of stone. Mandri had never heard of a garden composed entirely of curated stone. When he stepped through Salavan’s gate and onto a plane of bone-white pebbles, he gasped.
It was a true garden. It obeyed all the rules a young artist learns when scribbling out compositions for clients. First and foremost is to establish a hierarchy of form—if there are stones they’ve got to come in different sizes—big, medium, and small—and they’re to be arranged in such a way so as to draw the eye, or in this case, a person, through a maze of perception and towards what is important. It was about contrast. Most rules of thumb in art have to do with manipulating contrast. Sharp against soft. Dark against light. Many against few. Big against little. Here, a rippling sea of smooth white pebbles bounced up against jagged knots of gray granite, granite which grew in size towards the center of this snow-white field of stone. In the very center stood a towering spike of Fabled Black.
Mandri couldn’t believe his eyes. Outside of the Jeket’s cavern temples, he’d only seen tiny fragments of Fabled Black in satin lined boxes, resting on pillows, shielded by glass. Here was a sharp obelisk of it, and it was as tall and as wide as any of the four-story sandstone columns that held up the roof of the great mansion behind.
Fabled Black. The skewering stone. A shard of the firmament. The quintessence of night. If it were a tree, and the pebbles, grass, and the granite were bushes, it all would have been too deliberate—a stilted garden, devoid of the dynamism and spontaneity one sees in Nature. But this was a god-killing stone, and so the stasis, the absence of life, that was the point.
Mandri walked right up to this black obelisk. He saw his own reflection in its surface sheen split by streaks of rain. He looked worse than he’d ever been—eyes red and witless, face gaunt and sallow, lips cracked, and his sodden hair clung too tight to his meatless skull. He looked like death. Perhaps everyone who looked into the depths of Fabled Black looked like death.
He lamented the absence of his burgeon beer.
A man’s voice rose out of the ether behind him.
“The stone makes the most wondrous pigment.”
Mandri spun around, and standing five feet behind him was a massive man who stood two heads taller than himself, and he had a barrel of a chest was easily thrice the size of Mandri’s own. The man’s great bulk was draped in a white silk robe, and his face was Jandrian through and through—high cheeks, a strong brow, and narrow eyes. The only outlier was his hair, for he had no beard, and instead of the usual scruff of Jandri black, it was as white as his robe, or the rocks underneath his feet.
He didn’t look like a demon, though Mandri couldn’t be sure, for he’d long lost his burgeon beer, and without its aid his burgeonsight was dimming. Nothing was twisting the man’s genteel airs. He looked so prim and proper because he kept his great bulk out of the rain through the use of a tiny, black-lacquered umbrella.
This large man looked past Mandri towards the obelisk and said, “It makes a black that rivals the crow.”
Mandri dared to sneak a look behind at the spire of Fabled Black. He wanted to ask how this man had come into possession of such a thing, and why he dared to keep it outdoors. A spire of Fabled Black like this must be worth a mountain.
“I am Salavan,” the man said. “And you are the great Mandrameen. I love your work. I was hoping that, some day, you would find your way to my door, and here you are.”
Mandri spread his arms out wide to present himself.
“No need for such gestures,” Salavan said. He then walked up to the stone and set his meaty hand upon the spike of Fabled Black, caressing it as if it were a prized horse.
“It is incredible isn’t it?” he said. “Yet it is only a small sliver of the comet which killed Solraheen and Schisol.”
Curiosity got the best of Mandri, and he asked, “How did you get it?”
“Bribery,” Salavan said proudly. “Provisions for the smuggling alone cost me thirty-five silver strings.”
“I see.”
Salavan grimaced at Mandri’s critical tone. He said, “I didn’t steal it, boy, I paid for it. Didn’t pay the people I was supposed to, but I paid money. In truth, my acquiring of this stone was an act of charity—charity for the people who moved it, and charity for the thing itself. A stone such as this belongs in a place of prominence, not shuttered away in some dirty Jeketian cave. Here it is out in the air, where it belongs. You can touch it if you like.”
“No thanks.”
“You’re right, there’s no need.” Salavan pulled his hand away from the rock. “Merely being in its presence is enough.”
Fabled Black was notorious for its aura of gloom. A small shard of it could make the happiest child feel chill and rotten. Here in such quantity, that feeling crept down to the bone.
Salavan followed Mandri’s gaze. “Isn’t it strange that everything that falls from the sky should radiate sadness? Rain makes me sad, and so does this stone. Either the heavens are a reservoir of a despair and these elemental things are infused with it, or this earth is a supremely disappointing place, and so things cast down upon it radiate a longing to be somewhere else.” He turned to Mandri and his gaze became intense. “Would you say that’s what you feel right now? A longing to be somewhere else?”
“You could say that.”
“Don’t be so glib. Consider—wouldn’t the rain prefer to dance in the clouds? Wouldn’t this stone rather gird the stars than be stuck here in the ground? I think so. You see, the Black is alive. In a very real sense, it is alive, and I can’t wait to show you what it can do. Would you like to see?”
Salavan spared Mandri a beneficent smile. His teeth were as white as Pel’s, though for some strange reason, they did not sparkle—perhaps the stone, or the long march up the hill was pushing the burgeons out of Mandri’s sight and his mind back into sobriety. 
Mandri said, “I don’t have a choice, do I?”
“What gave you that idea?”
“A witch named Pel.”
“Ah, of course, Pel. I take it she said that if you didn’t come and see me, she would kill you.”
“Something like that.”
“And here you are, seeing me.”
“Here I am.”
“Then you have fulfilled that obligation, and you can leave if you wish.”
Mandri was stunned by the cold sense of it. But it was too simple, too legalistic. An evil witch wasn’t the kind of creature to care about the strict definitions of words. It wasn’t enough to simply see the man, there was something more he was supposed to do. He imagined Pel ripping out his innards as he screamed, “But I did what you said, I saw him!” 
Salavan’s eyes narrowed.
 “Mandrameen—can I call you Mandri? Mandri, I won’t have this tension in my house. You are safe here, and you are free to leave at any time. Or, if you are at all curious about what may lay in store for you, then say it, and we shall find it out together.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
Salavan chuckled and his great bulk chuckled along with him. He said, “Yes, I am aware. Would you like to come inside?”
Mandri nodded, but Salavan scowled back. “Assert yourself,” he said brusquely. “I won’t have any of this meekness in my house. Stand up straight if you can. Sol’s light. You look like you were born yesterday.”
“Whatever.”
Salavan scrunched up his big round face and said, “That’s not much better, but it will have to do. Come.”
 Salavan skirted around Mandri and past the spike of Fabled Black. The way he moved, it was dainty and deliberate, completely at odds with his massive size. He was careful to keep the hem of his robe out of any puddles, and his umbrella was so small that he couldn’t walk at stride without the rain splashing his legs—so he shuffled across his stone yard, looking to Mandri like a great white pig tiptoeing its way through nettles. 
Mandri followed, and once he was under the roof of the mansion’s grand portico, Salavan gave him a patronizing look of concern.
“You’re soaked,” Salavan said, “A towel and a change of clothes.”
Salavan clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed from a servant’s door, carrying a towel and a white linen tunic. Mandri was dried and fitted with the knee-length tunic, then he and Salavan proceeded inside.
“Do you like my home?” Salavan said. “It cost me fifty silver strings to import the lumber to burn the lime for the plaster, and that was just for the outer wall. This interior, the plaster, the paints, that cost…well, I don’t want to go on and on about expenses.”
Salavan gave a smug and self-aware smile.
Was the house extravagant? Yes.
Was it impressive? Mandri didn’t think so.
Unlike the garden outside, the place met expectations. Mandri could have been standing inside any number of the miniature palaces that scabbed the Hrkan world. Tall arched ceilings. Wide halls. Skinny walls. Sparsely decorated. Everything white. No lamps, or torches, for fear that the soot might stain that whiteness. Only natural light, Solraheen’s light, was allowed in. Today that natural light was a rainy gray that was unable to illuminate the vast interior. It was dark, and stark, and empty—again, not unusual, in fact it was desired, for the dull whiteness of everything was a religious expression of sorts. White is the most sacred color—white for the all-white spark. True white does not exist in the material world, ever since the glow of Solraheen’s body was snuffed out. Hrkan tradition claims that it is a pious thing to strive for pure whiteness. The ostentation of color was to be abhorred, unless it was bounded by a frame, in which case it was encouraged. Art, painting, these were sacred things, but they must be contained for it was said that Solraheen would refuse to dwell in a place that presumed to escape the bounds of being a mere created thing. 
It would seem that the quest for piety would be at odds with extravagant games the rich play to prove their wealth and superiority, but instead of humbling them, the cleanliness, the whiteness, the starkness, these became the rules of their competition. If one is only allowed to have nothing, then the question becomes, how much nothing could one man accumulate? The height of the ceiling becomes a measure of how much emptiness he could afford to horde. Judge the floor—the richer man’s floor bears nothing, not even dirt, such that a truly rich man could afford to employ a person or persons to always be wiping away the filth tramped in from the street. Salavan’s floor was as white as the sway-away ceiling, and as he and Mandri walked along barefoot, a girl was crawling behind on her hands and knees with a bowl of water and a brush, scrubbing away.
Salavan said, “How do you find my home?”
“Very clean,” said Mandri, careful to disguise his bitterness.
“Yes. Perhaps you will find my gallery stimulating. I’ve some pieces here that you won’t see anywhere else—but that goes without saying.”
“Any of them stolen?”
The accusation put a slight hitch in Salavan’s step. But he wasn’t upset, in fact, he almost seemed happy to be accused of stealing. He smiled like it was a compliment. 
“None of them are stolen. Aside from that shard of Fabled Black, I’ve acquired everything I own through perfectly legal means. I even have something of yours here. One of your best works, I think.”
“Spare me.”
“Don’t be modest, Mandri. I won’t have this falseness.”
Salavan clapped his hands and another servant came forth from some narrow orifice, carrying a shallow bowl lined with finger-length wraps of freeweed.
Salavan said, “If paintings aren’t your pleasure, how about a wrap?”
Mandri declined, and Salavan seemed genuinely surprised. “You are remarkably lucid,” he said. “You do have that hopeless look about you, but I supposed that was, you know, the general malaise of the indigent.”
Salavan selected a wrap for himself, put it in a pocket inside his robe, and waved the servant away. 
He said, “We shall skip the freeweed, and perhaps we’ll skip the gallery tour for another time, you came here for a purpose, after all.”
“About that,” Mandri said. “I can tell you right now that I’m not a—”
Salavan stopped him mid-sentence with a polite wave of his hand. He said, “You cannot tell me anything. I should say that I know more about you than you know about yourself.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“A thing to know about me, Mandri—I am straightforward and I do not lie because lying wastes time.”
“What’s my mother’s name?”
Salavan sneered and said, “I don’t pollute my mind with such trifles. The knowledge I have is more fundamental. Do you know a lizard’s mother’s name? No. Do you know more about a lizard than it knows about itself? Yes. Believe me when I say that you and every other dim-witted Spark don’t understand the first thing about what you truly are.” 
Mandri sighed. Salavan was no demon king, just another religious kook. A rich one. He wasn’t sure if he’d rather prefer the demon.
Salavan said, “I can see that you are going to need it explained. Come. We must study at least one piece of art. Come.”
Salavan led Mandri through a series of rooms, each with a ceiling higher than the one before. Common to the fashion of the Hrkan elite, what few furnishings there were, were muted. If there was a table, it was carved from a rough, pale sandstone. If there was a chair, its legs were simple, sanded branches, and its seat was woven reed. If there was a tapestry, it was devoid of color and image, for its purpose was to be a frame for the faded subtleties of Solraheen’s light, which at present was cold and dark, blueish-gray.
Eventually, Salavan led him into a cavernous room that had a circular cutout in its roof. A light rain suffused with silver sunlight streamed down through this hole to pitter-patter in a shallow rainwater pool on the floor. All edges of the room were laden with pillows upon pillows for comfort, all of them white with white tassels and stuffed inside ivory lace pillow cases.
On the other side of the column of rain was fresco that spanned the entirety of the wall. This painting was the object of Salavan’s march, and it was a magnificent work of art in skill and in subject. It depicted Solraheen at the very moment of His victory over evil—He was stretched out, as if flying, and his face wore a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his sword as He plunged it into His brother’s—Schisol’s—back. In the classic Hrkan style, Solraheen was pure white, and Schisol was an ashy black. The army of people surrounding them were cast in every color imaginable.
“This is my favorite piece.” Salavan said contentedly. “For sentimental reasons, mostly. The god of creation destroying the god of destruction. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? It has so much behind it, if you know what I mean.”
“I don’t.”
Salavan didn’t hear Mandri’s murmur.
“See this yellow?” he said. “Isn’t it beautiful?”
He was pointing to the golden rays which emanated out from Solraheen’s head. It truly was a fantastic yellow, extraordinarily vibrant, as if it had been painted on mere moments ago.
“Can you guess the pigment?”
Mandri answered, “I have no idea.”
“This yellow, it comes from the Gabo cow. Incredibly expensive. The most wasteful pigment imaginable. To make enough for this fresco I had to buy three men to care for fifty cows. I had to put them on a strict diet, the cows. They couldn’t eat anything but this little squeaking bug, called a zuberant. They look like locusts, but they are the thickness of your thumb, well, my thumb.”
“I’ve seen them.”
“They come in hives so they aren’t expensive. You make a paste out of them and feed this paste to the cows, and you stuff their bellies full all at once. That means you must starve them a bit so they take to that bug-paste like dogs to the bone. Then you have to time the next step just right, because you see, this radiant pigment comes from the chyme of the cow’s third stomach, so you must be precise with the cutting. You must wait until the chyme extrudes into that stomach, not the first or second stomach, the third stomach, and that’s when you cut open the beast and harvest as much of this yellow chyme as you can. Then, you dry it out into a powder, and that is that.”
“Interesting.”
“Once you have the powder, you can sell the meat. But I don’t sell the meat. I let it rot in the sun.”
“Why?”
“Because it feels…” Salavan waved his hand in the air as if to catch the words that could accurately describe what he was thinking. “It feels weighty to have killed a herd of beasts for the explicit purpose of painting my wall. Doesn’t Solraheen look radiant? And now that you know fifty cows died to make it seem so, doesn’t that make the fresco take on a more…Oh, I can’t find the words. It’s weighty. Makes it feel like it’s alive.”
“It doesn’t do anything for me.”
Salavan’s round face lit up. “Hah! It doesn’t do anything for you, does it?! Well you can’t judge me boy, no one can. The gods are all dead. And here are the last of them, Schisol and Solraheen, and there—” he pointed to the top of the piece, to the screaming black comet in the sky, “There is the Fabled Black coming to end them both. Such a fine image, no? The quality of the painting is sublime, yes?”
“Sure.”
“Don’t be flippant, Mandri. It is beautiful. This is Ellag’s hand. I trust you are familiar with her work?”
“I am.”
“You know, she’s here. Would you like to see her?”
“Not really, no.”
“Unfortunate. Seeing her is the first step of your test.”
“A test?”
“Yes, a test. I trust Pel told you what this is all about?”
“Something about an Amalgamete.”
“Not an Amalgamete. The Amalgamete. Be respectful. The gods are all dead, but a new one arises in him. Your test will determine whether or not your Spark is ripe for a meeting.”
“Is the Amalgamete a good god or an evil god?”
Salavan let loose a sighing smile, as if Mandri was a too-inquisitive child. He said, “Mandri, I’m surprised you haven’t learned the truth about good and evil. Good and evil, these are symptoms of a deeper fault in our natures, not causes in themselves. When He is done with His great work, there will be no question of who is good and what is evil, for all will be in accord with all.”
“That sounds evil.”
Salavan snorted a laugh. Mandri didn’t take kindly to it, and he blurted out, “Next you’re going to tell me Pel isn’t evil.”
“But she isn’t.”
“She ripped out Gil’s stomach.”
“Who is Gil?”
“My ox.”
“Your ox? What is evil about that? Have you never chewed on a slab of tripe?”
“She didn’t eat the stomach. She ate Gil’s Spark.”
Salavan’s brows jumped and he reflexively muttered, “Interesting,” then added, “You mustn’t judge her, Mandri.”
“I saw what I saw.”
“I do not deny what you saw, but you did not understand what you saw. Pel was not consuming that Spark for sustenance.” He then frowned and said, “I can see there’s little hope in convincing you. Your mind is too bent by the Solitants. It is amazing how a few shameless twists of truth written down a few thousand years ago become woven into a culture’s sinew. Ancient lies reach right down to the core of it. Even the story of how Solraheen killed himself to kill Schisol is a lie.”
“Is that so?”
“It is. Solraheen called forth a stone of Fabled Black from the night to entomb Himself and His brother—it is a simple and neat story, but is it the truth? Does it even matter? No, and no. What do dead gods matter when a new god is being born?”
Salavan put his fat finger up on the fresco and poked Schisol’s belly, right where Solraheen’s sword burst forth.
A click sounded from under the floor, and a square of stone levered open to reveal a narrow stairway descending into darkness. 
Salavan said, “Before we head down, I must demand from you your utmost commitment. I, unlike the Solitants, value honesty, so my good character compels me to warn you that there is a chance—a chance—that as we attempt to squeeze your Spark for ripeness, you will die. It’s only a chance, and a small one at that. I want you to consider the thought before you join me.”
Salavan hiked up the hem of his robe, and disappeared down into the stairs.
Mandri stared down into that inky blackness. Not a thought went through his head. He must have stared for quite a while, because Salavan’s voice echoed up, saying, “I said consider the thought, not inhabit it!”
As Mandri stepped down the stairs, a servant girl bustled out from some narrow passage and closed the hatch behind him.
At the bottom of the stairs was a short tunnel, and at the end of this tunnel was a cramped room. In this room, set up against the far right corner, was a fire in a bronze brazier. Set up in the middle of the room were three wooden chairs, two facing one, and sitting in the two were Salavan, and a person draped in a white sheet.
“Don’t look so pale, Mandri,” Salavan sighed. “I told you not to come down here if you weren’t committed. You’ve come, and now you’re here, yes?”
Mandri nodded.
“Good. Sit down.” 
Mandri took the remaining seat, across from Salavan and the veiled stranger.
Salavan pulled the wrap of freeweed from his pocket, and he lit it in the brazier’s flames. He puffed it thrice to get it going.
“So!” he said as he slapped his leg to capture Mandri’s attention. “Are you infertile ground? The castrated painter? Or is it simply, the painter who doesn’t want to be a painter? You’d be surprised how many of those we find.”
Salavan puffed on his wrap.
Mandri simply sat there.
“Are your wits here, Mandri? Are you here?”
Mandri nodded.
“Use your voice. Assert yourself.”
Mandri cleared his throat, nodded towards the sheeted person, and said, “Who is that?”
“As I’ve said already, it is possible that you could die. Ellag died. I keep her around for the purpose of demonstration, and I think her presence will help put you into the right frame of mind.”
“That’s Ellag?”
Salavan’s chair creaked as he laid back into it. He blew a puff of smoke out the side of his mouth, as if the smoke could go anywhere in this cramped room. Between the freeweed and the fire, Mandri was having a hard time finding a clean breath.
Salavan crossed his tree-trunk legs and said, “Tell me, Mandri, what do you think Art is? If you could define it. Define Art.”
Mandri wondered what Salavan was playing at. He said, “Art is whatever you want it to be.”
“Don’t be coy, Mandri. This is important. You must be eased into the right frame of mind before we move on to the test itself.”
“I just don’t think it’s an interesting question, and I’m more concerned about what’s under that sheet.”
“Is that why you don’t want to paint anymore, you think it’s uninteresting?”
“More or less.”
“Which is it, more, or less? Be specific. You’ve spent too much time in front of an easel not to have some idea of what it is that you are doing.”
“I make pretty pictures.”
Salavan rolled his eyes and took a long drag from his wrap. He held the smoke in his great big chest, and when he finally exhaled, his round shoulders slumped like the essence of life was leaving him.
“You think Art is merely a word,” he said. “You think that it’s a label that people slap onto things for utility.”
“I didn’t say that.”
“Then say something. I’m trying to help you avoid ending up like Ellag here.”
Salavan puts his arm around Ellag’s shoulder and gave her body a friendly shake. Her sheeted head rolled limply and then settled into the crook of Salavan’s shoulder as if she were looking to cuddle. As she did, the sheet pulled taught over her face, and as it did, a smear of blood welled up to stain the fibers.
Salavan narrowed his eyes and glared at Mandrameen. The air between them swirled with smoke. 
Salavan said, “Answer the question.”
“Is she dead?”
“Of course she’s dead. Answer the question.”
“What was the question?” 
Salavan sighed, then he steadied Ellag back onto her own chair so that he could lean forward and free his hands for explanation. He said, “Ellag thought that art was about the artist. A person goes out into the world and has some incredible experience—like you’re having now. It changes them in some important, fundamental way. They are a different person because of it. They look at the world differently. But how could any of their friends or family know that any of this has occurred? The change is internal. It is not written on the skin. There’s no new sparkle in the eye. Their behavior might be different, but that will never communicate the depth of what is going on inside the mind. Consider a woman crying—for what reason does she cry? She tells you her child has died, but you’ve never had a child, Mandri, so how could you understand? This is the problem which Art purports to solve. A work of art is an attempt to break through that impenetrable barrier between our minds.”
Not one word of that made it to Mandri’s ear. He was too focused on finding a chance to flee. Salavan was so wrapped up in his own words, and in the freeweed’s smoke, that Mandri wondered if he could make a dash for the stairs.
Salavan said, “That’s what Ellag thought. She thought that art is a thing an artist does to let everyone else know what’s going on inside.”
Mandri nodded along.
“Does that make sense?”
“It’s very sentimental.”
“Isn’t it? Sentimental, yes, that would be a word for it. Unfortunately, it is completely and utterly wrong. Look how wrong it can be.”
Salavan bent down, grabbed the foot of Ellag’s sheet, and in one quick flourish, he flipped it over the back of her chair to reveal her corpse.
Her dead head bobbed and settled, and as it did a trickle of blood dripped out of the empty sockets that had once held her eyes. The belly of her tunic had been ripped apart, while the belly itself had been carved open with surgical care—skin folded back like a book to reveal a cavity under her ribs. The firelight flickered inside. Mandri could see her spine. She was hollowed out. 
“Steady, Mandri. Steady yourself… Now, looking at Ellag, you might be wondering what I am attempting to communicate with this work of art. You might suppose that I think that I am an artist, and that this,” he put his hand on Ellag’s skull and twisted it about in a perverse display of puppetry. “This is me communicating to you in a way that lets you experience, in a profound way, who I am and what it’s like to be me.”
He let go of Ellag’s head, and it slumped down onto her collarbone.
“But that would be a misunderstanding. Consider this—why isn’t speech, casual, conversational speech like we’re having now, why isn’t that considered to be Art? I am manipulating my throat, tongue, teeth, and lips to shape a string of sounds for you to experience. Sentences are things that can break down that barrier between our minds, yes?”
At this point the freeweed was having its way with Salavan. His arm’s gesticulations were growing frenetic. He cut the air with a slicing hand and said, “No. I am not an artist. I am many things, but I am not an artist.”
“You’re a murderer.”
“I’m not a murderer, either.”
Salavan took another big drag from his freeweed. The room was so small, and the smoke was so thick, that Mandri supposed it was getting to him too.
“Actually,” Salavan said, “that’s not true, I am a murderer. But I think you’re referring to Ellag, here. I did not kill Ellag. She died because she thought painting was about the artist. She thought that the painter was important. She thought far too much of herself.” He was now churning his words in the air with his free hand, as if mixing his musings with the smoke would bring out some flavor of the truth.
“You’re insane,” said Mandri.
“It is good that you should say that. Ellag was never able to make that step. She was too…she was too wrapped up in herself. Frightened.” He leaned forward a little in his seat. “See, if you look into the dark when you’re frightened, you’re bound to see frightening things.” 
Salavan made an explosion with his fingers, pretending to burst his eyes.
“Her eyes exploded?” Mandri asked.
“They did. It was fascinating.”
“What about her stomach?”
“Oh. That was me. All done after the fact, I assure you. Pel wanted to query the girl’s stomach. But we shouldn’t get distracted. I think you are about where you need to be.” He poked these words with his wrap of freeweed, shaking a clump of ash free from the glowing tip, causing Salavan to eye his wrap with some concern. He stood up, set it gently down onto the corner of his seat, and moseyed over to the far left corner of the room, hidden by Ellag’s shadow.
From the dark he pulled a huge square stone slab which was as black as the darkness in which it sat. Salavan struggled with it for a moment, then propped it up against his thighs and waddled it over. He set it down carefully at Mandri’s feet, and then he shuffled back into the dark to fetch three three clay jars. He set these down next to the black stone panel. In each jar was black paint.
Salavan pulled from his robe a paintbrush. Its handle was short, half as long as Mandri’s forearm—short, at least, compared to the length of the brush’s head, which was about the same length. It looked more like a miniature whip than a paintbrush. Salavan handed it to Mandri and said, “I want you to use these paints to paint a picture.”
“Of what?”
“Don’t think about what you are painting. Don’t give yourself that privilege. Don’t think about what should or shouldn’t be. You need to simply start painting.”
“You want me to figure things out as I go?”
“No. No. Don’t figure anything out. You are merely a tool. True art creates itself. It is reckoned with on its own terms. It is its own experience. It communicates nothing but what it is. You kneel here—” Salavan rubbed the floor in front of Mandri with his foot. “And you become the tool by which the work creates itself.”
Mandri squinted in confusion. None of that made a lick of sense. If he thought about nothing, then he would paint nothing. Even if he wanted to paint something, it would be hopeless, because in this dim light he wouldn’t be able to see what he was doing. And there were only the three black paints to put on a black slab of rock.
Salavan sat back down, and the sheer weight of him plopping onto his too-small chair disturbed Ellag’s corpse and she slumped forward over her knees. Her limp wrists smacked onto the floor.
“This test,” Salavan said thoughtfully, “Is a test to determine how skilled you are at removing yourself from yourself. Artists make the best divine instruments because of how practiced they are at becoming empty vessels which a god can then make use of. Every time you paint, you suppress your own self, for you must look at the painting as if you had never seen it, as if you are completely oblivious to all the meaning you’ve nestled inside every brushstroke. You must do this because you wish to know how the painting will move on someone who is not you.” 
Mandri nodded as if Salavan was making sense. He then decided he better get it over with. Perhaps if he swirled some of the paint on the rock, then Salavan would let him leave. He knelt down before the black stone surface and thought about what he should do.
With no palette, the stone itself would have to be the palette. It wasn’t like he was going to run into trouble mixing paints if the only color was black. One by one one, he picked up the clay jars and, trembling, he poured their contents onto the stone surface. The only difference between these paints, it seemed, was their viscosity. The first paint came out of its jar in a clump. It slopped onto the stone like a sandy gel. Mandri could see little granules of Fabled Black sparkling in the firelight. The next paint was a clean, syrupy goo that drizzled out of the jar. The last paint was so thin that he had to be careful pouring it out, lest it splash all over the place. Thankfully, the surface of the stone was ever so slightly bowled.
When Mandri was done with all this, he cast a side-eyed glance at Salavan to see if the man approved of what he was doing.
Salavan glared back and said, “Don’t look at me, look at the work.”
Mandri’s breathing grew nervy, and the smoke in the air was stifling. He fanned his tunic—light as the linen was, the room's heat had become unbearable. He knew that Salavan was looking for him to do a specific something, and if he didn’t do it, he would not be allowed to leave.
“What will happen if I fail?” he asked.
Salavan shook his head and said, “Think, instead, of what will happen if you should succeed. If you can work, and let yourself be used by the work, then I am going to stick you onto a wagon, full of artists like yourself, and it shall cross the Sand and lead you to the Amalgamete. You shall meet Him in the flesh! Think of it—meeting a god! He will make you into a champion!”
“But what should I paint?”
This, Salavan did not answer. He took another drag of his freeweed and reclined back into his chair. He looked away, studied his own smoke, as if he was alone in the room.
Mandri turned his attention back to the slathered-black stone. 
What could he possibly paint with black, on top of black, on top of black?
He poked the long-haired brush into the sandy gel and spread it around. It did not mix with the other paints, it pushed right through them, and the thinner paints in turn flooded into the grooves left by the brush’s passing.
He sat back on his heels and studied the whorl he’d made. The sheen of the orange firelight played with each paint differently. It stuck softly to the fine grained gel, it stippled the syrupy fluid, and it hardly touched the thinnest paint. Wherever the thinnest paint pooled, the image was truly black.
Mandri began to push and pull the paints around to build an image out of the light, as a sculptor might build an image out of shadows. He didn’t much care about what he was making, the brush hairs were too long and too limp to be too deliberate.
What was he making?
Black pools welled up like the hollows of human eyes.
A face, why not?
A stripe of shadow for the upper lip.
Mound up the gel to bring out the cheeks.
It was coming along.
A long and powerful face.
Mandri swirled the brush around in an eye socket, trying to find an eye.
Suddenly, there it was, an eye of firelight.
It blinked.
Mandri startled backwards in fright. He quickly gathered his wits and peered disbelievingly down at that fire-flickering eye.
The thinnest stream of black ran down below the upper lip, opening the mouth, drawing Mandri’s eye.
Was there a tongue in there? A black snake of a tongue glinting in the back of the throat?
Yes. There it was.
“Do you see this?” Mandri asked, but no response came.
He looked up to see what Salavan was doing, but Salavan was not there. Neither was the dead woman. Neither were the chairs, or the walls, or the room—there was only Mandri, the fire, the face, and the void.
Suddenly, the face began to extrude out of the stone, dripping in Fabled Black. Mandri scrambled backwards on all fours. When the black head was fully in the round it tilted down to stare at Mandri. Its eyes were a rainbow fire and its gaze consumed him. Mandri could feel his Spark tug against his stomach, as if it were being pulled. He screamed, but no sound came. A pressure grasped at his throat, a pair of strangling hands, and this force jerked him backwards, and backwards again, and suddenly, he was yanked out of the void.
When Mandri opened his eyes again, he was stunned to see that he was back in Salavan’s basement. It was Salavan’s hands on his throat, and it was Salavan’s face hovering over his own.
“What did you see?” Salavan asked as he shook Mandri.
Mandri’s brow was pouring with sweat. 
“I saw—I saw a face.”
Salavan studied the painted slab, then muttered a single, breathless word, “Incredible...”
Mandri tried to pull himself free from Salavan’s grip, but the man did not let go. Instead, Salavan roared and threw his great weight down upon Mandri and pinned him against the ground. Mandri heaved and wiggled but it was all for naught, for Salavan was strong.
“Hold still! You…must…hold…still!”
Salavan jabbed his elbow into Mandri’s stomach and leaned his great weight into it, squeezing the air from Mandri’s lungs. Tears streamed down Mandri’s face and his chest burned in agony. Salavan’s meaty hands clamped tight on Mandri’s throat and he squeezed with all his might.
Salavan’s plumping smile savored every desperate wheeze.
“I knew your Spark was ripe the moment I saw you,” he muttered.
A few juddering moments later, Mandrameen’s body was dead.</Text>

It is amazing how a shameless twist of truth written down a few thousand years ago becomes a foundational pillar of orthodox belief.

“I mean abominations. Think of it, Mandri, if it weren’t for the power of the Mazydai which has been pulled from the flesh of Solraheen, the Hrks would never have conquered the outland tribes. </Notes>

For temptation, for blasphemy, for a whole battery of horrors, he was in some sort prepared: but hardly for this petty, indefatigable nagging as of a nasty little boy at a preparatory school. Indeed no imagined horror could have surpassed the sense which grew within him as the slow hours passed, that this creature was, by all human standards, inside out - its heart on the surface and its shallowness at the heart. On the surface, great designs and an antagonism to Heaven which involved the fate of worlds: but deep within, when every veil had been pierced, was there, after all, nothing but a black puerility, an aimless empty spitefulness content to sate itself with the tiniest cruelties, as love does not disdain the smallest kindness?&quot;

            <Text>They walked through the night. The first real feature of the desert that Mandri saw was clump of bluish hills obscured by the morning haze. Those hills in the east, Moteah remarked, were called the Dune Hills. Mandri asked why they weren’t simply called dunes, and Moteah said they weren’t dunes. She added that at a pilgrim’s pace it’d be a whole day’s journey to reach them. The Ayramun did not march at a pilgrim’s pace.
Seb charged ahead in front of them all with the grim determination of a woman who wanted it all over with as soon as possible. She never talked, and she never looked up from the spot of ground a few feet in front of her. She simply marched. When everyone else took a pause to water, she did not stop. Soon she was a few miles ahead, a brown poke sticking out of a sea of rising heat and sand. She never once looked back, and nobody called out after her to wait.
Far behind her was Ayram, and giant as Ayram was, his pack seemed too big even for him. Mandri could only see him from the calves down. And there was Ayram’s right arm, which metered out the miles with his iron spear casually thupping the earth.
Close behind Ayram, lagging like an eager pup, was Moto. Moto had come out of Minting Rock as if he were never there, for he’d taken pause to beat the dust off his bright orange robe. He’d even removed the blood stain on the shoulder with a watery brown ointment that he kept in a blue corked bottle. His pack was much smaller. Mandri could see his head.
A few yards off Moto’s heels was Mandri. He took two steps for every one of Ayram’s, and every one of these steps was a struggle. It wasn’t so much the wound in his thigh as it was the general soreness. His legs still hadn’t recovered from being dead, and a whole night of hard walking had been rough. He tried to distract himself from the ache by listening in on Ayram and Moto’s conversations. Moto had ideas about capturing another Mazidariga after it had sucked out Obo’s pseudospark, and when Moto had an idea, he’d engage his hands and shoulders to help express it. Ayram would grunt acknowledgment, and when Moto suggested that they should try another Minting Rock, the ridiculousness ran an itch up Ayram’s spine and the giant readjusted his pack, sending the web of rope holding it all together creakling under the strain. This evidently meant no.
Moteah and Elrahet formed the rear. The younger woman was making sure that old Elrahet didn’t fall behind, though to Mandri’s eyes Elrahet didn’t look like she needed help. She had set off from Minting Rock at a steady pace and had never wavered. 
“She has desert legs,” is what Moto said when Mandri asked about it. Mandri didn’t know what ‘desert legs’ meant until that afternoon, after they’d crossed a good distance and the red sand gave way to a softer, deeper pink sand. His foot would sink with every step, and that set his calves to burning. He wanted to stop walking, sit down, and massage the muscles, but how could he when Elrahet would pass him by? Every time he glanced behind, Elrahet was there, a waddling blotch of black rags propped up by her cane, threatening to make him look a weakling.
But he was a weakling. He knew it, everyone knew it, so he didn’t know why he was soldiering through it. And it’d be at least eight more days of this—eight more days of Obo’s weight screwing a knot into his lower back. And because Mandri’s shrugging muscles were nothing but gormless strips lounging atop his shoulders, the litter’s thin straps bit right down through them to bruise the collarbones. Mandri kept trying to shift the straps around, to try and distribute the pain, but after a while, every spot along his shoulders was tender.
“Sol, this hurts,” he moaned. By now he’d used up every joint in his fingers to take the weight of the straps, and every fingernail was throbbing.
“You’ll find your legs in a couple of days,” Moto said over the annoying rattle of his pack. “We’re almost to the hills.”
The Dune Hills loomed large a few hundred yards away. Mandri was worried Ayram wouldn’t stop when they got there. The heat was unreasonable, but he supposed Ayram would want to squeeze effort out of every finger. Seb had already crested one hill and disappeared behind it—if they were meant to stop, surely she’d wait at the peak.
It turned out that the Dune Hills were aptly named—half clay and rock, and half sand. They weren’t sandy enough to be considered full-fledged dunes, but there was too much sand whipping about to not consider them such. They were steep, the tallest ones were a good four times Ayram’s height, and their pink slopes were pocked by smooth black boulders that looked like they were bleeding rust. There wasn’t a single sign of life anywhere, plant or animal.
They struggled up and over the first hill, but after that, there were plenty of gaps and valleys which Ayram seemed to know. To Mandri it was a confusing web in which every slip face looked exactly like every other, and all of it looked ready to collapse down on him if the earth were to give the slightest shiver. Ayram, confident as ever, led them through this maze until they came upon a shallow, sandy pan in the center of which was the smallest temple in all existence.
It was the quaintest thing, a single circular hut with sand-blasted walls of rough-hewn sandstone bricks. It had a domed roof of baked clay, and set atop its center was a vertical pole of petrified wood, tipped by a coronal splay of twigs—an Old Jandri piece which signifies a sacred place.
There wouldn’t be enough room inside for all of them to shelter from the afternoon sun. If they tried it would be standing room only, and Ayram’s scalp would scrape against the ceiling. Still, it was their destination, and as they approached, a swarthy woman popped out of the building’s shadow, bearing a self-satisfied grin. It was Seb.
“Took you long enough,” she said.
Ayram dumped his large pack next to the little temple’s entrance, and everyone else did the same, though Mandri was a little gentler with his own. With his shoulders and back relieved of their Mazid burden, he peered into the temple’s dark interior and hoped he’d find a chair.
“We should keep going,” Moto said.
No one agreed. Elrahet waddled straight into the temple, and Moteah followed.
“We’re on a good pace,” Ayram said.
“But we’re only a day out from Minting Rock.”
“I’m four days out from sleep,” said the giant. He then picked up his monstrous bag, wrangled it through the temple’s threshold, and ducked in behind it.
With Elrahet, Moteah, Ayram, and Ayram’s bag stuffed inside, there’d hardly be enough room for one more, so Mandri, being considerate, offered the position to himself. He rushed towards the entrance, stuck his head inside, and was surprised to find it empty. The explanation was there on the black brick floor—a hole. It was a perfectly circular hole. Mandri stepped inside the temple and peered down into this hole, where below, a firelight flickered into being. Ayram and the others were setting up camp inside.
Seb pushed on Mandri’s back. “Hurry up.”
“What is this place?” 
“It’s a hole. Now move it.”
The ground below the hole didn’t look too far away, maybe as far as Mandri was tall, so he jumped down into it. His ankles were the first things to realize that the ground was much further away than he imagined. He hit the dirt hard and his tired legs crumpled against the impact. He fell forward, and the rest of him thumped against the ground like a sack of beets.
Seb’s voice came from raining down from up above, “You know there’s a ladder, right?”
Mandri rolled over and saw a firm wooden ladder standing there, taunting him. He was too tired to feel any kind of embarrassment, though that didn’t stop Seb from cackling as she descended down to Mandri’s level. Her boots hit the floor, then she stood over Mandri and said, “I know exactly what you need.”
“I need rest,” Mandri grumbled.
“Yes, yes—that too.”
The room was a near-natural pear shaped cave, with only a little bit of work elbowed into the floor to flatten and smooth it out. The ladder ran right down the middle, and the wall beyond opened up into a tunnel which ran farther out than Moteah’s stick-and-tinder campfire flame could reach. Mandri didn’t care to ask where that tunnel led, all that mattered was that he was tired and there was enough room here to lay down. Ayram had already spread himself out, laying against his pack, eyes shut tight, hands clutching his folded arms, wrestling with sleep.
Mandri maneuvered himself nearer the dark tunnel, for there the air was cooler. He sat down, carefully, and claimed a spot of floor for himself. By the time Moto wandered down the ladder, he was dreaming of burgeons and beer.
The first thing to wake Mandri was Obo. Someone had brought Obo down the ladder and placed him next to Mandri. When Obo saw Mandri looking, the Mazid whispered, “Only two-hundred thousand steps to go.”
“What?” 
“There’s two-hundred thousand more steps until Bullr, roughly speaking.”
“Oh,” Mandri said as he closed his eyes again. Then he wondered aloud, “How many have we done already?”
“About twenty-thousand.”
“How do you know?” Mandri asked, already half asleep.
“There wasn’t much else to do but count.”
The second thing to awaken him was a feverish sweat. It was dark, for the meager fire had burned itself down to a tumble of coals, and the daylight outside was fading. All was dark and cold, and yet, Mandri was burning up, drenched in sweat.
He sat up and fanned his robe against his tingling skin, and didn’t lay down again until he made peace with the fact that he wasn’t going to feel better. His legs ached, his back was sore, his shoulders were shredded, and he didn’t know how bad his feet had suffered until he unwrapped his shoes to find that his heels were working up blisters. From then on, what sleep he managed to get came in fits and spurts, a few minutes here and there, and then he’d wake up sweating again. This back and forth sent his mind into a state of delirium, such that when Seb whispered out his name he was unsure if it were a dream.
“Mandri? You awake?”
 Mandri opened his eyes and all he saw was a shadow hovering over him. He knew it was Seb from the smell.
“Everything hurts,” Mandri groaned.
Seb leaned nearer still until she was whispering above Mandri’s ear.
“I know what you need. What you need is burgeons.”
Mandri’s ears perked up.
“You have burgeons?”
“Shhhhh,” Seb hushed. “Not so loud.”
The next thing Mandri knew he was following Seb’s faint footfalls into the darkness of the tunnel.
Mandri supposed they’d bumble around a bend or two so they wouldn’t have to whisper as they bit into the burgeons, but Seb kept going, and going, and every now and then they had to stumble down a flight of steps—never up, always down.
“Where are we going?” Mandri asked. His voice sounded strangely close to himself in the darkness, as if he were speaking directly into his own ear.
“I got a fire, up ahead.”
Mandri followed Seb around one more turn, then down a hall, and they stepped into a fire-lit room.
This room was a dome of natural stone with thin spikes of rock dripping down from the ceiling. In the middle of the floor was a fire, and next to it, there was a chair.
A blessed chair.
Mandri couldn’t believe his eyes. A skinny, square, blackwood chair with a seat of suspended red cloth and a back to match with a red pillow relaxing against a flat arm.
Seb was walking towards it. Soon she had her hand on the skinny armrest. Such a woman did not deserve to sit in such a chair.
Mandri asked, “Could I sit there?”
Seb sat down in it. “My burgeons, my chair.”
The rest of the room was empty and chalky white save for soot staining the ceiling. Mandri sat cross-legged on the floor next to Seb and he huddled closer to the fire. It was much colder down here than up above.
“Already sore?” Seb asked.
“I’m past sore. I’m broken.”
“Mind me to share you some spines tomorrow. I got plenty.”
“They help with soreness?”
Seb leaned back in her chair and fished a green thorn out her robe’s pocket. She eyed it as if it were a jewel.
“You chew ‘em, an it keeps you alert. But it’s more than that. The juices work the bitch right out of you.”
Seb popped the borcandi spine into her mouth and got to chewing. The first few chomps were accompanied by a horrible crunchy squelch, like she was biting down on a beetle.
“You don’t have the jaw for ‘em,” Seb said. “Look at that jaw. You got a woman’s jaw.”
“Well, my diet consists mostly of burgeons.”
“I bet if I made a flute outta your bones it’d sound like a widow wailin’.”
Mandri sat still. He’d bear any insult if there was a burgeon at the end of it.
Seb reached back into her robe. She fished around for a moment more and pulled out a leather pouch. She dangled this pouch around in the firelight, and Mandri tried not to look too impressed. 
“So, you a burgeon man?” Seb asked.
“Burgeons are the only thing that make life worthwhile.”
“Then you’re in luck. Look at what I got here.”
Seb reached into the pouch with two dirty fingers to pinched the stem of a burgeon. What she pulled out was stunning.
“What is that?”
“Call it God’s Eye.”
Mandri marveled at it. It was the most beautiful of all possible burgeons.
What a burgeon is, in short, is an intermediate stage between a flower and a fruit. Only burgeon bushes go through it. The final fruit looks something like a melted cluster of berries, with seeds dotting every pit. The burgeon itself is a plump capsule of hardened leaves, not too dissimilar to the more familiar flower bud.
The best way to grow burgeons is to shield them from the rain and drip-feed them on a careful schedule via irrigation ditch. This stresses the plant, and for some reason, the stress causes it to put out more flowers. Mandri always believed that this was a spiritually significant fact, a clear and direct example of how suffering leads one to bear richer fruit. It was one of creation’s themes. Of course, the plant can’t deal with too much suffering, not to the extent that Solitants might think is good for it. Withhold all the water and the burgeons never come out at all. The suffering has to be planned out far in advance, measured and applied by an experienced torturer. A daily regimen of sufferings, precisely applied, and as Solraheen makes holy men so too can men create plump and juicy burgeons. These God’s Eye burgeons were so plump and so juicy that they must be akin to saints.
“Where’d you find those?” Mandri asked.
Seb let the burgeon roll around in her palm to let the light play on its iridescent exterior, dark purples and blues. “Beautiful, ain’t it?”
Mandri reached out to touch it but Seb quickly clutched it away. “You think I’d give it for free?”
“I don’t have anything to give you,” Mandri said. “I’m not going to suck your toes or anything.”
“You got a dirty mind?”
“I was joking.”
Seb leaned forward in her chair to wag her finger right at Mandri’s nose.
“I know what they get up to in the cities,” she said. “It’s one sin after the next. One dark Spark corrupts all the others. That’s why people got to keep separate.”
Seb relaxed back into the chair and continued to admire the burgeon.
“What are we doing down here?” Mandri asked. “Why couldn’t we just eat the burgeons back up there?”
“Ayram don’t much appreciate burgeons. Liable to slit our throats if he gets a whiff.”
“Really?” Mandri said, eyes going wide.
“No. He’d be disappointed, is all.”
“Well, I don’t want to be on Ayram’s bad side.”
“Ayram’s only got the one side. Ayram is Ayram. Nothing else.”
Mandri nodded like he understood.
“Now,” she said, “How do you like your burgeons?”
“Any way I can get them.”
Seb scoffed, and licked her lips like she was about to say something mean, but she stopped herself.
“You’re like that Mazid,” she said. “Never can answer a question straight. Bet you would try to outwit a fart.”
“Seb, I honestly don't care—whatever you want to do to that burgeon, I will consume it. Crushed, boiled, stewed, crumbled in eggs, dripped over bacon, pressed into beer…”
“If you had to choose.”
“Well, one time I made a burgeon tea and boofed it.”
“Boofed it?”
“Poured it into my ass.”
Seb’s face screwed up as she confronted the mental image. Mandri hadn’t ever actually done this, but he loved the way the thought of it tortured Seb.
He said, “That’s what I thought too until I tried it. You only need, like, a quarter of the usual amount to get the same effect if you boof it.”
“City folk,” Seb muttered, disapprovingly.
“Hey, Solraheen didn’t put a second mouth inside our butts for no reason,” He was joking, but he kept going because of the tremendous frown Seb was wearing. “You ever think of it like that? If I were designing human beings, I wouldn’t mix the piping up like that, but it is what it is. It’s like you say, if He didn’t want it to happen, it wouldn’t have happened.”
Seb’s frown grew ever-deeper. She couldn’t say anything because the logic was structurally sound—it was what it was because of how it was.
“Think about it like this,” said Mandri. “We’re still nine days out from Bullr, and how long are those burgeons going to last us?”
“Us?” Seb asked accusingly.
“Well, okay, fine, how long will they last you?”
“This is God’s Eye, boy. It don’t take much to split open a stomach. Half a sliver off the stem would do it—even if you been accustomed.”
Seb pulled her long dagger from her waistband.
“Hold out your hand,” she said.
“Why?”
“Hold it out.”
Sane people don’t give their hands to a grungy knife-wielding woman in a cave. Mandri, lured by the promise of a God’s Eye burgeon, had no choice. He would have given his one good hand to a demon for the chance to taste that saintly burgeon.
Seb dropped it onto his palm. It rolled around, and then settled onto his fingers. 
“Hold still,” said Seb as she reached down and held the burgeon steady. Her blade cut through as if it weren’t even there, and when she pulled away, she pulled the burgeon away, and all that was left in Mandri’s hand was a few dewy drops of a cloudy pale-green sap.
“That’s it?” Mandri asked.
Seb held her blade out. Stuck to its edge was a thin sliver of burgeon. Mandri peeled it off, and then popped it in his mouth and swallowed it.
“The sap, too,” said Seb.
Mandri didn’t need encouragement to lick his fingers dry.
Then Seb whipped out a little glass vial, plopped the bleeding burgeon into it, and tucked it away.
“You aren’t having any?” Mandri asked.
“Sometimes, folks get a bad reaction to God’s Eye. It’s best if I play Minder for a while.”
“I’ll be fine.”
“Everyone says that.”
“I bet I’ve consumed more burgeons than any man alive.”
“Just sit back and watch the fire.”
Mandri stared at the fire and waited for the burgeonsight to kick in. He was quite giddy, because maybe a God’s Eye burgeon should give him a god’s eye sight.
“How long is this going to take?” he asked.
“Depends on the person.”
“You know, I wonder if the Mazidai are affected by burgeons.”
“They ain’t got Sparks.”
“I kinda want to give some to Obo and see what happens.”
“I won’t waste a good God’s Eye on no evil creature like a Mazid.”
“Evil?”
“Yes. Evil.”
“He doesn’t seem so evil to me.”
“Hah!”
“What?”
Seb gazed into the fire and said, “I seen a Mazid roast a child on a spit.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“I saw it with my own damn eyes,” she snarled. “It ran an iron shaft the width of my arm right through the little boy’s throat and… and then two smaller ones to pin the arms and legs.”
Seb's cheeks went flush as she talked. If her story weren’t true, she’d at least convinced himself that it was.
“Why would a Mazid do that?” Mandri asked.
“Who can say why evil does what it does?”
Mandri paused for a moment and tried to think. He tried to conjure a few excuses, but the burgeon juice was working its magic, for the flames of the fire were starting to slow right down.
He simply said, “Whatever.”
“Now hold on,” said Seb. “You do know the Mazidai are evil, don’t you?”
“Yeah, sure, they’re evil.”
“Nah, nah, nah. You think that freak upstairs is good, don’t you!?”
Mandri’s lids were getting heavy. He said, speech blurred, “You say you’ve seen some things. I’ve seen other things. I can only really go on what I’ve seen.”
“That Mazid would burn the world if he got the chance.”
Mandri shrugged his shoulders.
“Don’t shrug your shoulders at me.”
“Oh, come on,” Mandri said. “You know what they say…”
“What do they say?”
“There’s always…” his thoughts fluttered as the fire’s flames turned from orange to green. “There’s always two sides to every story.”
“Two sides? You shittin’ me? TWO sides!? What’s the other side to ten thousand folk gettin’ killed for runnin’ away? Cut ‘em right the fuck in half!”
“Ohhh, shit,” Mandri murmured as the world turned around him. He lay back on the ground to try and anchor himself. This had no effect.
Seb hovered over him.
“There’s a stright-down evil staring you in the face, and you can’t see it ‘cause of shome jrupin ol rashsifsh agrash suj…”
Mandri could no longer make sense of Seb’s words. The rock walls were folding around him, stretching past him, and when he looked past Seb at the soot-stained ceiling, he began to fall upwards into it, imperceptibly at first, but soon enough the rock zipped past in herks and jerks, then the black stained features of the ceiling began to congeal into a ceilingless void. 
This was nothing like burgeon-sight. This was nothing like reality at all. In a blink he’d been transformed into what seemed like pure movement—yes, he was nothing but movement, bursting, jolting up and down, no elegant smoothing in and out, no sense of natural timing. It was like he was being picked up by a god who liked to play with his food.
Mandri was still all there at this point. He knew that he was not ‘movement’, that this was all the work of the God’s Eye burgeon, and almost as soon as he set his mind to the task of bringing himself back down he succeeded—he was back in the cavern room, laying on the floor, staring up at that soot-stained ceiling.
But that soot was dark, black as night. Black as Fabled Black. And suddenly he was lost again, lost to the burgeon. He stared, stupefied by the sight of a fibrous purple ooze seeping out of that ceiling black, swirling like ink. As it descended it’s color changed into a deep and suffocating red. It reached down and latched onto Mandri’s stomach, adhering to his skin, for he was now, suddenly, naked.
“Seb!?” he called out, but there was no reply. He looked but there was only an empty chair. He tried to scream but the fibrous red had slithered up his chest and darted into his mouth. Next thing he knew, he was cocooned, and the red color filled his sight like a fog until all edges merged into each other and Mandri could not discern where he ended and the world outside began.

Beyond this point, Mandri could not construct a coherent sequence of events. There were shapes. Patterns. Eyes. Stasis and metastasis merged into an impossible third state of being.

When Jesus Became God, by Richard E. Rubenstein

 Lord Jesus Christ: Devotion to Jesus in Earliest Christianity. 


Philippians 2:6-11 Jesus is exalted by God to a status he did not previously occupy and given a name, the divine name, that he did not previously bear. In 1 Corinthians 15 the human Jesus exalted by God to rule over everything but God is shown to be subordinate to God. 

You are (1) treating the Aramaic idiom for a human being as though it were a title, which it is not, (2) assuming that Daniel's vision must have been of an individual even though the beasts were symbolic of empires, and (3) assuming that Daniel, if he was seeing an individual ruler of the people represented, the saints of the Most High, that he was not seeing a vision of that human ruler being given authority in the future.
In the New Testament it is only in the Gospel of John that the Son of Man begins to be viewed as having a prior existence in heaven. Of course, that and other works are drawing on the Parables of Enoch the interpretation of which also needs to be discussed if one is going to treat this subject thoroughly.

Science is boundary defining - it can talk about how things are different, but not how they are the same ???
How did the infinite god become the finite world? Platonists.

Hurtado, Larry W, 2013. &quot;Resurrection-Faith and the ‘Historical’ Jesus&quot;. JSHJ 11: 35 

https://larryhurtado.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/jshj_011_01_03_hurtado.pdf

P37 : Moreover, although the Gospel narratives portray Jesus as acting with divine authorization and accompanied by divine/miraculous power, e.g., in casting out demons, healing, and other miracles (e.g., Lk. 4.14-21), the resurrection is a fully distinguishable event. In the Gospel accounts, Jesus is very much the active and cooperating vehicle through whom God’s power is displayed, and he is the active agent in these narratives. Through Jesus’ words and actions divine power works miracles. Jesus touches the sick and pronounces them healed, commands demons to depart, rebukes the wind and waves, and summons the dead back to life. Jesus’ words and actions generate interest in him and criticism/opposition against him, the unavoidably central question being whether he is the valid spokesman and vehicle of divine purposes. It is significant, therefore, that, although there are statements about Jesus ‘rising’ from the dead (active forms of ἀνίστημι), in the overwhelming majority of NT instances Jesus is referred to as ‘raised’ (passive forms of ἐγείρω), either explicitly or implicitly by the act of God, Jesus the recipient and beneficiary of God’s power.7 Moreover, the statements commonly regarded as reflecting earliest proclamation tend to present Jesus as raised by God (e.g., c. 4.24-25; 10.9-10). In the Gospel narratives people are recipients of and respond to Jesus’ actions, but in the early proclamation of Jesus’ resurrection he is usually the object of divine action. Jesus’ resurrection certainly generated christological claims concerning him and a remarkable devotion to him, but we must note that NT discourse about the cause and agency effecting Jesus’ resurrection is also rather equally theological and even theo-centric. To underscore this point, I note that the NT texts do not typically ascribe Jesus’ resurrection to some inherent invincibility to death, or to Jesus’ own power.8 Instead, God’s power is exercised upon the truly-dead-and-helpless Jesus. As Gerald O’Collins put it, ‘God was the resurrector, Christ the resurrectee’.9 I shall return to this point later. 


. In contrast to the figures in such narratives, Jesus is not pictured as brought back to mortal life, but as catapulted forward into eschatological life, becoming thereby the first to experience this new eschatological embodiment. 




So, fourthly, we must note that in the NT Jesus’ resurrection also typically involves his exaltation and designation as the one who holds a unique status, both in relationship to the elect and to God. One of the earliest confessional formulae (Rom. 1.3-4) portrays Jesus’ resurrection as involving his designation as ‘the Son of God’.16 Acts 2.32-36 declares that God raised [ἀνέστησεν] Jesus and exalted him to his ‘right hand’, thereby appointing him ‘Lord and Messiah’. Another text that is widely thought to preserve an early Christian hymn refers to God’s supreme exaltation of Jesus and conferral upon him of ‘the name that is above every name’, for the purpose of Jesus receiving universal acclamation as Kyrios (Phil. 2.9-11). This universal acclamation of the exalted/resurrected Jesus was practiced corporately already in the early Christian worship setting, as reflected in Rom. 10.9-13, which explicitly refers to the confession of the resurrected ‘Lord Jesus’ (v. 9). The contextual appropriation of the OT expression which connotes worship, ‘call upon [ἐπικαλέω] the Lord’ (vv. 12-13), clearly indicates that this confession of Jesus’ exalted status was a liturgical action that carried this meaning.17 

Although Jesus’ message was focused on the kingdom of God, it is clear that very quickly within the period of his own activity he became ‘the issue’ on which people unavoidably had to decide. It was impossible to separate completely the question of his validity from the question of the validity of his own message. His teaching and other actions were sufficiently noteworthy and even controversial that people were required to judge whether he was or was not the valid spokesman for God, whether his actions represented the divine agenda to which assent must be given. 

43-44

In a previous discussion, I have emphasized the polarizing effect of Jesus’ activities, some individuals drawn to follow him and others who set themselves against him.21 In the circle of those aligned with Jesus, he was unquestionably the leader (the ‘Master’) and the others his followers, his word authoritative for them, and some of them even willing to give up their livelihoods to join his itinerant ministry. It is reasonably clear that his followers (and wider circles of the Jewish populace) regarded him as bearing prophetic authority, at the very least comparable to one of the biblical prophets.22 He was for his followers not simply one inspiring, eloquent teacher, prophet and holy man among others. Instead, even within the time of his own ministry, Jesus’ followers clearly defined themselves as a circle gathered around him, and regarded him as the eschatological person in whom God’s kingdom was heralded and signaled. 

Indeed, it seems to me entirely likely that during the time of his own activities at least some of his followers entertained the hope and expectation that Jesus would be revealed and recognized as (royal) messiah. The poignant statement in the Lukan Emmaus story is a dramatized but (I propose) an authentic reflection of this: ‘We had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel’ (Lk. 24.21). Moreover, this view of Jesus’ significance seems to be confirmed by the actions of Jesus’ enemies. As Nils Dahl argued decades ago, Jesus’ crucifixion must have been based on the charge that he was a claimant to (messianic) kingship.23 It is significant that Jesus alone, and none of those most closely linked to him, was seized and crucified. Clearly, the authorities (both temple leadership and Roman governor) regarded him in particular as the matter to be dealt with decisively, apparently believing that his execution would be sufficient to dissipate his following. So, the manner of his execution suggests that Jesus’ opponents were convinced that he was a royal-messianic claimant (or was intending to make such a claim). They were, thus, either massively and curiously wrong (to put it mildly), or (as I think more likely) were reasonably well informed of the enthusiasm and high expectations circulating among Jesus’ followers.24 

46

As I noted earlier, Jesus’ resurrection is predominantly referred to as God’s action, with Jesus the recipient and beneficiary of it. Moreover, this divine act involved both the remarkable bestowal of eschatological existence upon Jesus and also the unique exaltation and glorification of him. So, the proclamation of Jesus’ resurrection comprises a strong set of christological claims and also an equally robust claim about God. Moreover, Jesus’ central importance in earliest Christian discourse and devotional practice is predicated on and framed by the conviction that God has raised and exalted him, and now requires the acclamation of Jesus’ exalted status. That is, the christological content of earliest resurrection discourse is linked indissolubly to God’s actions. Jesus does not become a second deity, but has been designated by God spectacularly as the Messiah, the Lord whom all creation should now revere, and the divine Son who bears uniquely the favor of, and intimacy with, the one God.29 

Furthermore…

Likewise, the striking way that Jesus features in earliest Christian devotional practice is justified with reference to God’s action. This emphasis that Jesus’ exceptional status and significance rests on God’s own action and will is indicated, e.g., in Phil. 2.9-11, where God’s exaltation of Jesus is to issue in universal acclamation of him, which in turn serves ‘the glory of God the Father’. In keeping with the more polemical tone of the Gospel of John, Jn 5.22-23 declares that God now intends ‘that all should honor the Son just as they honor the Father’, and the Evangelist insists that ‘Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him’. Equating the honor to be given to Jesus with the honor due to God effectively makes Jesus co-recipient of worship, but this is emphatically so by God’s own fiat. In short, Jesus’ exceptional significance is rather consistently expressed with reference to God and God’s actions and will.30 

So, although the impact of Jesus’ ministry is an important factor, the proclamation of Jesus’ resurrection also involves God’s further, new action. This means that Jesus acquires a status and significance that surpasses, and cannot be accounted for by, his own earthly activities. The Jesusdevotion of early Christian circles is not adequately explained by, and did not arise simply from, his teaching or even his reported miracles. It was not the predictable or inevitable outcome of his ministry. Even if Jesus foresaw and predicted his own divine vindication, and even if this vindication involved his own resurrection, this would not have generated the specific conviction that he has been singled out for resurrection now, apart from the elect. Moreover, divine vindication of him as prophet, even as royalmessiah, would not automatically have generated the claims that he has been exalted to a unique heavenly status, given to share the divine name and glory, and that cultic devotion to God must now incorporate him as well. 

So, in addition to the impact of Jesus himself (and tradition about him) upon his followers, we also have to think of something additional, and also powerful in its impact. We must posit something sufficient to account for the strong specific convictions that God has raised Jesus from death to new eschatological existence, that God has exalted Jesus to share in divine glory, that Jesus’ name now bears divine authority and power, and that Jesus is now the Lord to whom all must offer acclamation. These convictions cannot be traced back convincingly to the teaching of the earthly Jesus alone. They are, at the least, radical escalations and extensions beyond the implicit and explicit claims that most scholars would judge can be attributed to Jesus. In several publications over the last twenty years or more, I have argued that these convictions were also prompted and decisively shaped by powerful religious experiences that struck the initial recipients with revelatory force.33 The resurrection of Jesus is a case-study in this phenomenon of experiences generating innovative religious convictions. So, let us consider what earliest information we have about the experiences that generated the claim that he had been resurrected. 







https://larryhurtado.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/how-jesus-became-god-per-ehrman/

With probably the majority of NT scholars, Ehrman emphasizes that the exalted claims about Jesus reflected in the NT (e.g., that Jesus shares divine glory, divine rule, the divine name, and is to be given universal reverence) all appeared soon in the aftermath of Jesus’ execution.  These convictions were based primarily on experiences of the risen/exalted Jesus (“visions” in Ehrman’s terms) by Jesus’ followers, which conveyed the conviction that God had raised Jesus from death and had uniquely exalted him as Christ and Lord. 

Ehrman (rightly in my view) also notes that these lofty claims about Jesus reflected in the NT seem to have erupted very early, so early that they are presupposed as widely shared already by the time Paul wrote his letters (from ca. 50 CE and thereafter).  In a commendable example of changing his mind, Ehrman acknowledges that prior to immersing himself in the evidence and scholarly analysis for this book, he had assumed a much slower and more drawn-out process, but was driven to conclude that these remarkable Christological beliefs erupted much earlier and much more fully than he had thought.  It’s always reassuring when a scholar admits to learning something new, and even to changing his/her mind. 


As a final criticism, Ehrman posits that the key to Paul’s Christology is that he thought of Jesus as an (or the) angel (of God/the Lord).  That, says Ehrman, explains how Paul could ascribe “pre-existence” to Jesus, and how, as a devout Jew, he could countenance worshipping Jesus.  As the key basis for this notion, Ehrman invokes a peculiar reading of Galatians 4:14, where Paul says that in his initial visit the Galatians received him “as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.”  Ehrman insists that this is to be read as a flat appositive construction, in which “an angel of God” = “Christ Jesus.”   But this isn’t actually as compelling a claim as he thinks.  Even Gieschen (on whose work Ehrman relies here) presents this reading of the construction as only a distinct “possibility.”  And most scholars (myself included) don’t think it really works.  The grammar certainly doesn’t require it, and it seems more reasonable to take it as a kind of stair-step statement, “angel of God” and “Christ Jesus” as ascending categories.

CONTEMPORARY HERMENEUTICS AND THE STUDY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT1 RICHARD B. GAFFIN, JR.

THE question of hermeneutics (or how the Bible is to be interpreted) is at the center of contemporary theological debate. In fact, it does not go too far to say that today all theological discussion is, in one form or another, hermeneutical discussion. Particular lines of inquiry are seen to converge in a hermeneutical focus. Specific issues are considered to be reducible to a hermeneutical common denominator. In a word, the problem — for it is recognized to be such — the problem of hermeneutics is felt to be the theological problem par excellence. 


To be more specific, hermeneutics and exegesis are related to each other as theory to practice. Hermeneutics is concerned with enunciating principles of interpretation derived, for the most part, from previously established epistemological and philological considerations, principles which, in turn, are to facilitate understanding of the text as they are applied in the concrete act of exegesis. This, for instance, is the conception of hermeneutics developed by Abraham Kuyper in the third volume of his monumental work on theological encyclopedia: hermeneutics is &quot;de logica der exégèse. 


these three aspects: language, translation, and exposition — , the leading movement in current developments refers to itself as the &quot;new hermeneutic&quot; (singular) in distinction from hermeneutics (plural). 

Nothing is more characteristic of contemporary hermeneutic than its attention to language, be it that of the text or the interpreter. 

(1) The first of these is the positive and indispensable role of language in understanding. Language is not secondary to meaning. Language is not the surface distortion of a presumably deeper level of meaning. Rather, one must make his point of departure, as Robinson puts it, &quot;the unbroken linguisticality of understanding.&quot; 
(2) A second stress, correlate with the first, is that all language is itself interpretation. The significant implication of this point, so far as the text is concerned, is that as it points to the subject matter, the language of the text is not only in need of interpretation but is already itself an initial interpretation of the subject matter. 

Hermeneutics has (of necessity, as we shall see) come more and more to deal with the phenomenon of understanding itself. 

Contemporary hermeneutics is intelligible only as it is seen to have its proximate roots in the so-called &quot;Enlightenment.&quot; That is, contemporary hermeneutics has its origin in that period (during the latter part of the seventeenth and during the eighteenth century) when the principle of human autonomy — which has always been latent in the heart of man — begins to come to consistent, well-worked-out, one may say, blatant expression. Man's reason is canonized as the final authority. The notion of an external authority of equal magnitude, be it that of Scripture or the church, is emphatically rejected. Coupled with the elimination of what has been referred to as the &quot;God-hypothesis,&quot; is an assertion of unbounded confidence in the ability of man to penetrate the mysteries of the cosmic order. History and nature are presumed capable of a completely immanent explanation. The pointed hermeneutical significance of this Enlightenment principle of autonomy may be stated in a single sentence: &quot;Man is his own interpreter.&quot; 

Several factors need to be noted here, factors which, it should be stressed, are inextricably related: (1) The doctrine of verbal inspiration, the notion of the divinely spirated, Godbreathed origin of the biblical text is abandoned along with the broader understanding of the nature of God and his activity of which this doctrine is a part. (2) A distinction begins to be made, an element of discontinuity introduced, between revelation, the Word of God, on the one hand, and the Bible, the words of men, on the other. (3) The methodological inference which is inevitably drawn is that no exceptions are to be granted to the Bible when it is dealt with as a text. It is to be treated like any other document which comes down to us out of the past. Scripture like all things historical has perhaps its relative right but no more than that. The presence of errors is a necessary methodological assumption. To put the matter more formally, the Bible (like any other historical document) is held to be the proper object of that methodology which in the past two hundred years has become more and more clearly defined and universally applied, the so-called &quot;historical-critical&quot; method. According to this method, the task of interpretation consists not only in explaining the text but also in passing judgment on the authenticity of what is reported and the Tightness of the views which are expressed. In short, the center of authority passes from the text of Scripture to the interpreter. 

The awesome, truly abysmal difficulties of this position were not immediately apparent. 
One may say that in its initial stages the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; was blinded by what is recognized on all sides today to be an incredibly naive, dogmatic Rationalistic outlook. However, it did not take long for the fundamental problem to surface. Because there are so many facets to this problem, it can be given various formulations. For our purposes it may be put as follows: if all historical phenomena (the biblical text included) are exposed to the corrosive effects of time, the relativity of history; then by what reason, on what basis, do the interpreter and his interpretation escape this same relativizing erosion and decay? 

It is not inaccurate to say that this is the question which (in one way or another) has moved virtually all theological and philosophical reflection during the past 150 years. To express it again in the plaintive words of Ernst Troeltsch: &quot;Where in life was support to be found, if all of its contents are historically conditioned and therefore fleeting and transitory?&quot; Idealistic philosophy, in particular, gives special attention to this problem and seeks to secure the autonomous human subject by establishing that personality (or some aspect thereof) is untouched by and therefore impervious to the flow of history. The result, however, was a hopeless historicism which the periodic revival of a rancid rationalism could perhaps temporally suppress but not alleviate. 

On the whole, the twentieth century has been somewhat more sober and careful. To be more precise, the movements within the orbit defined by the axis between Barth and Bultmann have shown themselves to be more sober and careful. But this sobriety does not involve in any final sense a repudiation of Enlightenment presuppositions. It by no means includes a rejection of the &quot;historical-critical&quot; method of biblical interpretation. On the contrary, this method is applied with increasing refinement and rigor. It is held to be a common, extra-theological motive. Acceptance of the historical-critical method is made the price of admission to the guild of theologians. It bears repeating here that the principal developments in theology during this century are not an abandonment, only a more subtle recasting, a more shaded reassertion, of the principle of autonomy. Hence the designation of these developments (or segments of them) as a &quot;neo-orthodoxy&quot; is a misnomer whose inappropriateness becomes increasingly apparent. 

Contemporary theology does differ from that of the nineteenth century, however, in that it has given up trying to secure man against history. On the contrary, it has come to assert — and to assert emphatically — the historicness {Geschichtlichkeit) of human existence. This notion of historicness is a difficult and many-faceted one. It has built into it the basic structural elements of the dominant theological outlook of our day. At this point in our discussion, however, it is sufficient to note in particular that it involves the idea of the radical temporality, the transitoriness, the unmitigated relativity, of man's being. Such an outlook is not without significant consequences for hermeneutics. The primary hermeneutical implication now is that both — the interpreter as well as the text — are caught up and swept along in the relativizing flow of history. No longer is the interpreter held to survey the text in regal objectivity and presuppositionless splendor. Rather he, like the text he seeks to interpret, is limited in his outlook and restricted by his presuppositions, which are bound to give way and be replaced in another time and place. This &quot;preunderstanding&quot; of the interpreter, however, is absolutely essential. No interpretation can take place without it. 


Hence that which gives distinguishing character to contemporary hermeneutic is its understanding of interpretation as dialogical in nature. Interpretation is dialogue in the most profound and fundamental sense of the word. The hermeneutical situation is understood as the interplay, the conversation, between text and interpreter, each with its definitely restricted perspective, each with its only limited validity. It is this back and forth movement which has given rise to speaking about the &quot;hermeneutical circle.'' In dealing with the text, the interpreter is not a spectator in the balcony, but an actor on the stage. He too is involved in the flow of history. Consequently, not only does he interrogate and interpret the text, but the text addresses, challenges, &quot;interprets&quot; him (the interpreter). 


7 A favorite model usçd to describe the nature of this speech event, this linguisticality, is the distinction between seeing and hearing. Man in his essence is not one who sees, but one who hears. He is not one whose concreated task is to subdue the earth and conquer it. He is not so much one who surveys and makes definitive statements about something or someone. Language can be used in this way (as it is for instance in science), but then it is being employed superficially, inauthentically. Rather man is one who is addressed and hears, who ever speaks to and is spoken to. (Here one comes upon the deeper motive for the current stress on preaching and proclamation.) Correlative to this view of man, history is not seen primarily as an ordered, connected sequence of events. Rather its essence is a dynamic, interpersonal reality, fluid and open in character. 

, I would underscore that the intensity of this preoccupation reflects just how pressing has become the dilemma created by the rejection of the divine origin and authority of the Bible. A crisis in understanding is the price paid for autonomy, for making man the interpreter constitutive for meaning and revelation. Ours is a day when, as never before, man has become a question to himself. Man himself has become hermeneutically problematic, and his entire existence is conceived of as one great interpretative endeavor. In a world in which it is held that the only absolute is uncertainty, he searches for norms. From the aimless roll of time in which he is caught up he tries to wrest meaning. On the ever-drifting sands of historical theology he attempts the impossible task of erecting a coherent statement of faith.

1) Opposition to the presuppositions of the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; must continue to be sharply focused and unabated. To put it positively, the consideration of most profound, most fundamental hermeneutical significance is very simply this: the Bible is God's word. That this is basic is obvious, but just how basic does not always appear to be sufficiently grasped. The Bible is God's word — one must say that this, strictly speaking, is a pre-hermeneutical or, if you will, a metahermeneutical consideration. 

that conviction may not be called in question or made hermeneutically problematic. Let me be crystal clear concerning the conviction I am talking about here. It is not a deeply rooted persuasion about the central message of the Bible; it is not a being grasped by the basic theme of Scripture, although this, to be sure, is involved. Rather it is a settled conviction, a firm belief, concerning the text as text. 

The book of Romans, these words penned in ink on the papyrus (perhaps by an amanuensis!), 

But it appears to me increasingly necessary to insist that the conviction that the words of the Bible are the very words of God is an integral and inamissible component of saving faith. 

In other words, there is danger that, in one way or another, we begin to treat time as an enemy of God's truth and seek to secure ourselves against history. One must certainly share Professor Zuidema's recently expressed pique over the caricature that orthodoxy views the Bible as a book which has been dropped down straight out of heaven.9 Still, it is difficult to deny that in the orthodox tradition justice has not been done to the historical character of the Bible, either in terms of its origin or its contents. There has been and continues to be a tendency to view Scripture as a quarry of proof texts for the building of a dogmatic edifice, as a collection of moral principles for the construction of a system of ethics. That is to say, there is a tendency to force the Bible into a mold, to impose upon it a unity which, to a greater or lesser degree, is foreign to it. 


New Testament Theology 

https://www.obinfonet.ro/docs/tbnt/tbrex/caird-tbnt.pdf

The argument against the holy spirit is guiding you, and him, as that you are coming to different conclusions as people who are also invested with the holy spirit. 


G. B. Caird, was a British theologian, biblical scholar and Congregational minister.  At the time of his death he was Dean Ireland's Professor of the Exegesis of Holy Scripture at the University of Oxford. 

New Testament theology is a historical discipline. It is not to be confused with either dogmatics or apologetics: for its purpose is neither to provide scriptural authority for modern doctrinal beliefs nor to make those beliefs appear reasonable and defensible to the unconvinced inquirer. Its purpose is descriptive. 2 We may indeed believe that in the New Testament we have a divine revelation valid for all ages. But that revelation was made in historical events, and those who first thought out the significance of those events did so in relation to the circumstances of their time and with a pastoral concern for particular congregations; even their general statements were made with reference to the particular. They never dreamt that what they wrote would, centuries later, be subjected to the microscopic scrutiny of modern biblical scholarship, providing in every unusual phrase and every unexpressed assumption matter for a doctoral dissertation. Nor did they imagine that it might be used as a rule of faith and practice in a world changed beyond their imagining. Yet for us that scrutiny is necessary, since we cannot be confident in discerning the relevance of their teaching to our day until by all the resources of historical research we have learnt its relevance to their own. Karl Barth once properly warned us to be suspicious of a biblical research which loses itself in details of antiquarian reconstruction and forgets that the Bible is a book about God; but the Barthian revolt against Historismus all too easily becomes an indifference to history totally incompatible with the belief that God revealed himself in events which happened sub Pontius Pilato 

The distinction between New Testament theology and other related disciplines is one which has all too often been ignored. Systematic theologians naturally wish their work to be regarded as biblical theology, in the sense that it is in harmony with what they find written in Scripture. But to confound dogmatics with New Testament theology is to assume that the New Testament writers had minds which worked exactly like ours and were interested in the same questions as we are. 

If, for example, we take it for granted that Christians in the first century attached much importance to the questions of church order which occupy the attention of modern ecumenical conferences, we shall certainly distort what little the New Testament has to say on this subject; for the Pastoral Epistles are more interested in the bishop's morals than in his authority. Romans 9-11 will certainly be misrepresented if we treat it as Paul's philosophy of history or as a treatise on predestination and free will, and not as a very practical wrestling with a problem of missionary policy. Paul, in Romans 13 was not merely airing his views on the state but communicating something to a particular group of readers, so that we need to determine not only what he could have meant by the words but also what the readers could have been expected to understand by them. If we not only ask what a New Testament writer said, but also what he was communicating when he said it, we shall be chary of giving the New Testament doctrine about a question which the New Testament writers themselves never raised. 

There is therefore an element of judgement in all history, not merely in the sense that the historian must exercise critical discrimination, but in the sense that we are judged by what we make of our past. This does not mean, however, that historians are hopelessly imprisoned within the walls of their own subjectivity or of the subjectivity of their time. The work of creation is never ex nihilo. It must be admitted that Winston Smith in George Orwell's 1984, whose task it was to 'correct' back issues of The Times in order to make them conform with party propaganda, has his counterparts in real life; and that even those who adhere to the principle 'Comment is free, but facts are sacred' are liable by inadvertence to impose on facts an interpretation they are incapable of bearing. But the moral of this long tale is simply that historical accuracy is the product of free discussion, honest criticism, and constant revision. 




This method has one obvious advantage. If New Testament theology is to be of value, it must be of value to the ongoing life of the Church; and one of its functions is to supply 'raw material' for systematic theology. Theologians have with justice complained that the findings of biblical scholarship have too often not been presented in a form which they could readily use; 6 and the dogmatic method is, superficially at least, exempt from that complaint. But the objections to it are overwhelming, for it raises at least four types of problem. 


1. There is the problem of category, i.e. the confusion of doctrine with revelation. 'For the love of Christ leaves us no choice, when once we have reached the conclusion that one man died for all and therefore all have died' (2 Con. 5:14). Paul undoubtedly believed in the objectivity of God's saving and revealing act in Christ; but the impact of that event on his own life depended on his having reached a conclusion about it. Doctrines, ancient and modern, are the product of human thought about the revelation of God; they are not revealed truth. 7 We are saved by believing in God, not by believing doctrines, not even the doctrine of justification by faith. 

2. There is the problem of interest. The dogmatist assumes that the New Testament writers dealt with matters of perennial significance, and concludes that what seems important to him or her must equally have been important to them. But the New Testament shows, for example, little interest in those questions of church order which have engrossed the attention of modern ecumenists. Paul, like Jesus, is impatient of protocol; 8 it did not matter to him who administered baptism, and there is not a shred of evidence that it mattered to him or to anybody else who presided at the eucharist. James Barr 9 has effectively shown that, while the biblical writers frequently use words for time in talking about other subjects, they never, with the one exception of Qoheleth, make statements about time itself. and he has reasonably questioned whether there is any value in speaking of 'a biblical concept of time'. When the Second Vatican Council decreed that there are not two sources of revelation (scripture and tradition) but only one (scripture as interpreted in tradition), there was an immediate danger that conservative scholars would start ransacking scripture to provide authority for those dogmas which had previously been believed on the basis of tradition alone. 10 E. P. Sanders has convincingly argued that the traditional Lutheran interpretation of Pauline theology, together with the picture of Judaism which it assumes, is the projection on to the first century of a sixteenth century controversy. 11 Personal interest is thus a common intruder into the study of the New Testament academic. 

3. There is the problem of reference, i.e. the assumption that in the New Testament 'the speaker is referring to what we should be referring to were we speaking the words ourselves'. 12 When, for example, we read of a contrast between gospel and Law, we tend (if we are thinking dogmatically rather than historically) to suppose that the one refers to the Christian and the other to the Jewish religion. But Torah covers much more than what we mean by religion; it is also the code of civil and criminal law of the Jewish nation and the national ethos of the Jewish people, the Jewish way of life. 

4. There is the problem of authority. Modern Christians naturally wish their teaching to be regarded as biblical, in the sense that it is in harmony with what they find in Scripture. This is an aim which any honest biblical scholar will hardly wish to criticize. But if that harmony is guaranteed from the outset by doctrinal authority, whether by the explicit statement that the doctrines of the Church are ex sese irreformabiles or by the unacknowledged infallibilities which are more characteristic of the churches of the Reformation, 13 it becomes nothing more than a tautology. Human beings hardly put themselves under the authority of the word of God in the Bible--under its criticism and judgement, its illumination and renewing powers--unless they allow the Bible to speak, above all the voices of ecclesiastical dogma, with its own original, authentic voice. Moreover, the dogmatic approach to the New Testament is inevitably selective. Theologians of various traditions have all appealed to the New Testament to provide warrant for their conflicting views, and so have made themselves vulnerable to the cynical epigram of Werenfels: 'This is the book in which every one searches for his own opinions, and every one with equal success finds his own opinions.' 

1.2.2. The Chronological Approach 

Those scholars who led the revolt against the dogmatic method, deeply impressed as they were by the variety of New Testament experience and thought, denied also that there could be a theology common to a collection of books which were the product neither of a single setting nor of a single generation, and undertook to substitute for the theology of the New Testament 'a history of New Testament thought'. The aim here is simple: we must trace the growth of Christian ideas from the seed-beds of Jewish or Graeco-Oriental thought, through the various stages represented in the New Testament, to the catholic 


Those who have contributed to the history of early Christianity have come to it from a particular field of research and with a predominant interest which has coloured their view of the whole period. Thus Professor Bultmann discovered in the New Testament evidence of Gnosticism, where the Old Testament scholar sees only the natural and proper development of Hebrew ways of thought; and the provocative writer Stauffer, criticizing Deissmann and Dalman for attempting to illuminate the first century by the use of Hellenistic or Jewish documents from later periods, represented early Christianity as merely one branch of apocalyptic. Just as the nineteenth-century quest for the historical Jesus, with its host of mutually contradictory lives of Jesus, ended in a horrifying form of scepticism, so the mutually incompatible histories of early Christianity have raised doubts about the validity of their method and the very possibility of their objective. Nobody will dispute that it would be desirable to possess an account of the development of early Christianity which would command general agreement. But do we have the evidence to make this possible? The chronology of the New Testament is notoriously problematic, even for the life of Paul, where the evidence is strongest. 17 The attempt of J. A. T. Robinson 18 to give an early date to the books of the New Testament has not won many converts, but it has demonstrated the precarious nature of the arguments by which dates have been assigned. And if it is hard to date whole books, how much more speculative must be the dating of their constitutive elements, the hypothetical sources and redactional strands of the Gospels and such items as the hymns which it has been fashionable to detect within the Epistles? Scholarly terminology has frequently disguised the difficulties rather than solving them. What, for example, does the term 'prePauline' signify? Is it that which antedates the conversion of Paul, or the writing of his first letter, or the writing of the letter which happens to be under discussion? And can we be sure that what is pre-Pauline in the second and third senses is independent of the influence of Paul? 

-12- 
It was once generally accepted that in its doctrine of the person of Christ the New Testament displayed a steady development from the 'low' Christology of Jewish-Christian Messianism to the 'high' Christology of the cosmic Christ and the logos doctrine; but Dom Gregory Dix 26 has warned us against too facile an assumption that a Christology expressed in Greek terms of status is necessarily higher than one expressed in Jewish terms of function, and in any case there is no Christology in the New Testament higher than that of Phil. 2:6 ff., which is earlier than any of the non-Pauline writings. B. Lindars has argued that the use of Old Testament quotations in the New Testament underwent a logical development dictated by the changing apologetic and pastoral needs of the Church; but he is careful to point out that this 'logical sequence . . . can be linked to historical development at some points, but not always'; 27 and that, in one case at least, ' John preserves the oldest application, Acts the second, and Mark the latest'. 28 Whatever hypothesis we adopt about the 'primitive' beliefs of Christology or any other subject, we are liable to find that in some respects Matthew, Luke, and John are more 'primitive' than their predecessors. 29 In any religious community different degrees of development and different levels of profundity coexist; movements of thought rarely proceed in a single, straight line. Moreover, developments do not necessarily take place at the time when they are first recorded, nor are the processes by which new ideas are reached necessarily identical with the arguments by which they are subsequently defended. 

The task of writing a history of early Christian thought is thus beset by at least as many pitfalls as the task of writing a life of Jesus, and scholars who attempt it are likely to find that their work commends itself only to their most ardent disciples. But even if such a work could be successfully completed it would in one respect differ from New Testament theology in that it would deliberately ignore the canon. If the apostolic age is to be treated simply as an important chapter in the continuously unfolding story of religious thought, or even of divine revelation, the books of the New Testament are not in principle different from any other book. According to this view, these books are normative for the life and teaching of the Church, not because of any intrinsic quality, but because the Church, after much wavering, has so decided.

            <Title>Pile Of Dead</Title>
            <Text>A long year ago, Mandrameen decided to quit painting. In the weeks leading up to that moment, he’d laze the days away in the hall of a governor named Eruhd. Mandri drank the governor’s wine, stuffed his face with peach chicken potstickers and pickled lizard pluck, all the while admiring the paintings of the Lady Frumule.
Mandri liked Frumule’s work. She had no equal—surpassed by some, yes, but no true equal. She was decent. She was a painter’s painter, and that meant that the subtleties of her brush were completely lost on the Hrkan elite, and her tremendous talent went largely overlooked. Mandri saw in her a kindred spirit, and he was inspired by almost everything she did and that included how she died—she killed herself by jumping from a balcony that overlooked the sea.
Mandri had scribbled a few charcoal compositions of that moment, the moment just before the jump, the lady standing on a white stone banister with waist-length hair wind-blown against her figure, hugging her, when nobody else would. Strangely, Mandri could never find someone to put up the funds for the finished piece.
On one of those lazy days spent idling around in the governor’s halls, Mandri saw a rare sight—one of the twelve Hrkan Lords was admiring Frumule’s paintings. The old man stopped to contemplate each piece, an especially curious sight because this Lord was the Lord Gagan, a rough and tumble fellow who’d clearly risen up from the grumble of the Skulsi, a battle hardened fanatic who looked more likely to chew on the canvas than admire its deft use of color. He wasn’t the usual foppish wimp that makes a show of art appreciation. And Lord Gagan struck his most thoughtful pose before Frumule’s greatest work, a painting titled, “The Shadow of the Goriol Valley”.
Mandri’s opinion of the painting was that it was a work of meager genius, and only meager genius because Mandri could not admit anyone as a true genius. The painting was good. It was a view from the low Goriol Valley trail, looking up at the ridge line which sheltered the valley from the eastern winds. The sun was setting behind that ridge, so most of the scene was covered in shadow—blues, purples and muddy grays that seemed almost red when nestled against those cooler hues. Near the bottom, in the middle distance, was a sinuous, slow flowing creek. Its water was truly red. That’s the first thing the viewer sees as one walks towards the painting from afar, for not only is the creek spotlighted by the sun peeking over the ridge, but the composition is structured in such a way that the eye is drawn to a stepping-stone waterfall that’s set on a golden third. Below this waterfall, bobbing in its pool, is a brown lump of something strange. Step a little closer to the painting and it becomes clear that this lump is a face-down, lifeless body. The water isn’t merely red, stained as such by clay or vegetable matter, it is blood red, for the shadowed valley slope above is carpeted in human corpses.
One almost has to squint to see the bodies, but they are there, soldiers all, brown bodies folded and crumpled on top of each other like a storm from the Abari highlands had ripped through the valley and dumped them there. 
Lord Gagan said, “I think this is the worst painting ever made.” 
No doubt the Lord had seen a mound of bodies before. Probably, he’d ordered them made. Perhaps the Lord was suggesting that Frumule should have painted fruit and flowers instead, because a sheltered woman could not possibly capture the greater meaning that a well bloated body presented when it was piled on top of twenty others. Mandri couldn’t say for sure as he had never seen a pile of the battle dead. He always assumed that he never would. He would never know if the Lord’s chiding remark had merit. Then the battle of Minting Rock happened and a good seventy something Hrkans died, and half the Ayramun as well. When the fighting was finished, Ayram directed whoever was left to gather up the dead, Hrk and Outland alike, and put them into a pile. 
They were to be piled into the shape of a sphere. Mandri was not told why it should be a sphere instead of a regular old pile, and as a pile of bodies does not naturally take a sphere’s shape, Mandri was conscripted to construct a large bowl out of Minting Rock’s rubble. Mandri spent the afternoon building that giant bowl, and he did a terrible job on account of the hobble in his leg, his missing hand, and his general desire to be useless. When the bodies were eventually tossed into this leaky bowl they made a regular old lump—not a sphere. 
No one seemed to care. An effort had been made and an effort was enough. Mandri supposed everyone was too exhausted to be upset with poor workmanship. And they were handling their own dead friends, so the mood was dour. There were also those desiccated giants, the ones that had been tucked away inside of Minting Rock’s tombs for who knows how many centuries. In the collapse they’d split apart like twigs and whatever was found of them was tossed on top of the pile like kindling.
By twilight the grim deed was finished, the dead were together. Mandri was allowed to creep away and rest against a heap of rocks, and there he sat, alone, munching on some Hrkan hardtack he’d gathered from a dead man’s robe. His thoughts turned to that painting of the Goriol Valley and the Lord Gagan’s chiding critique.
This pile of dead did not resemble what Frumule had painted. There was significantly more blood in Frumule’s vision, and Frumule’s dead bodies were more seductive, though that was just how people were painted, living or dead. Her bodies were well-muscled and well-naked, or half-naked, and they looked like they’d just stepped out of a bath instead of choking each-other in the sand. It was a typical dramatic device—the perfection of youth cut down before their time—but Frumule’s message went further than that, for Frumule came from a school of artists who thought they had important things to say. She wanted to make people aware, as if they weren’t already, of mankind’s abiding concupiscence.
Her subject was war, her project was the perversion of lust and desire. Frumule’s battlefield lay strewn with naked men lying upon naked men. They’d all come down from their passionate trance, where reason gave way to baser instinct, where they wrestled, where their limbs tangled and their weapons, phallic, penetrating, stabbed into slits that bled. It was all quite pointed and homoerotic, with eyes rolled back, jaws slack, because ecstasy and death often looked the same and so did battle and sex—if one side isn’t satisfied, perhaps they go at it again until everyone is utterly spent.
Mandri surveyed the rubble of Minting Rock, as well as his own memory of what had transpired, and there wasn’t a lick of sexual energy in any of it. There’d been excitement, yes, but that did not last long. Whatever relief there was at the end had been firmly put to bed as soon as the bodies of the dead were tallied.
Forty’s body could not be found, and that set the mood of the Ayramun careening into a fog of gloom. She had been well-liked. Seb had seen her jump into the fray, before the collapse, and that meant she was entombed in the bottom of Minting Rock’s central well.
Chopper’s death was unnecessary. He’d lived through the collapse, but in a fit of chop-lust he sprinted towards a Hrkan soldier and was walloped by Ayram’s spear. Ayram was not forthcoming about precisely how it occurred, as all he said was, “The idiot got in the way”. But Chopper’s body told the story—his ribs were shattered, and his lips were stained by his own blood. He’d died choking on it.
Bush-headed Tob had been unlucky. He’d survived the first half of Minting Rock splitting off, but from the way Moto told it, the second half’s collapse sent a leg-sized shard of stone whistling down in Tob’s direction. If Tob had been standing a step to either side, he would have survived.
The old witch Elrahet survived, as old witches always do. She was busy mumbling witchy incantations as she laid her hands on the pile of dead. Moteah was beside her, managing a meager flame that illuminated nothing as she tried, pitifully, to shield it from the wind. The rest of the surviving Ayramun—Ayram, Seb, and Moto—kept themselves busy trying to salvage what they could from the destruction. They’d already looted the dead for anything useful, mostly foodstuffs, as the Hrks had brought plenty of hardtack wrapped neatly in crinkly brown-leaf squares, each stamped with the sunrose sigil of Hrk.
“It’s all bullshit,” Mandri muttered.
He was referring, of course, to everything—his leg, his skin sticky from sweat, Frumule’s attempt to impress the world, and the Ayramun, too, because all their friends had just been slaughtered and they were already moving on. They were glum, sure, but it didn’t feel like that was enough. Not a watery eye in sight when someone should be wailing. Poor Chopper. Poor Tob.
And Obo was gone.
Unfortunate.
Mandri had lost his hand for nothing.
He thought about humming a song for Obo. Obo wasn’t human and never had a Spark, but he was deserving of a song, and if not a song, at least something more than mere remembrance.
Mandri groaned against the thought that he shouldn’t even be here. He should be back in Meskalim, laying in his field getting high on burgeons.
High as the uglies on a too-tall horse.
Folks in Eez call it tickleberried.
All he had to show for his many travails were the wounds.
Seb had been idling nearby like a dried out lizard. She said, “You look mad to be alive.”
Mandri snorted and said, “Unfortunately it seems I’m too lucky to die.”
“Lucky?”
“I’ve cheated death about five times in the past four days, so I’m starting to think that luck is real.”
Seb chuckled, though that did nothing to lighten the mood because she was so grimy. A fat black borcandi spine poked out between her rubbed-down teeth. 
“No such thing as cheatin’ death,” she said. She spat a wad of goo into the sand. “If there was, then everyone been cheatin’ death every moment of their lives. Shit, since you been sittin’ there you breathed ‘bout a hundred times—that’s a hundred deaths you just put off, but I don’t see you thankin’ luck for the miracle.”
“Breathing is not a miracle.”
“Tell that to folks that can’t breathe. Friend of mine once died when she was sleepin’. Wasp flew straight in her open mouth and stung her in the dangly bit. Thing swole up the size of a pigs uglies.”
“Sounds horrible.”
“An’ it could happen to you. Could happen any given moment, but I don’t see you prostratin’ yourself every second, thankin’ luck for keepin’ the damn wasps from uggin’ up your throat.”
“Well, in case it’s necessary, I will give thanks.” Mandri opened his arms to the reddening sun and said, “I thank you, Luck, for keeping the wasps away!”
Seb snorted and smirked. She appreciated the sarcasm.
“No one’s special,” she said. “Everybody is who they is, an’ that’s all they is.”
“I don’t disagree.”
“Wouldn’t matter if you did. The gods are playin’ a game an’ that’s all there is to it. An’ you best believe me—‘cause you might catch sight of the hand of Solraheen, and you best be ready or else you get slapped.”
“Right,” said Mandri, flippantly.
“Don’t ‘right’ at me,” Seb said, offended.
“Sorry. It’s just the last time I heard someone talk about Solraheen’s hand, it was a priest getting his head chopped off.”
“What’s a priest losing his head got to do with it?”
“He was arrested for stealing the legs of the Lybion martyrs from the temple of Jeetz.”
A look of disbelief on Seb’s weathered face. She said, “Them legs are as watched as the sun.”
“That’s why they caught him and put him on trial. And you know what he said in his defense? He said the hand of Solraheen directed him. He said if Solraheen didn’t want him to have such sacred relics, then Solraheen wouldn’t have allowed the theft to occur in the first place.”
“And he were right.”
“The judge said that if Solraheen wanted that priest to keep his head, Solraheen wouldn’t have allowed the man to be caught.”
Seb nodded without appreciating the irony. “That’s how it is.”
They both sat there, staring at the mound of bodies, Seb in wistful repose, and Mandri leaning away, wondering if the odor pricking his nose was coming from Seb, or himself, or the bodies. The woman was still as dirty as when that Hrkan soldier had pulled her out of the sand. She was as comfortable in that cake of dirt as any burrowing lizard.
Eventually, Seb stood up and said, “Come on.” She brushed off her ass, as if that would wipe away the absolute filth that covered her. “I been lookin’ for the Mazid’s body all day, an’ now that you're free, you’re gonna help me find it.”
“Why?”
“Because that’s what Ayram told me to do, an’ now that’s what I’m tellin’ you to do. Let’s test your luck, maybe you find him afore me.”
Seb and Mandri spent the next hand and a half searching for Obo's body. They had no luck until Mandri got tired of looking and decided to apply himself. He realized that if he’d been thrown clear of the destruction, then Obo probably had as well. From there they checked around where Mandri landed, and sure enough, there was Obo, still swaddled in black, poking out of the sand like a black grub. Seb didn’t want to touch Obo, so Mandri pulled him out alone, though this didn’t require much effort. Mandri found himself hoping that he’d feel Obo wiggle back to life once shaken, but no, he was as lifeless as the rest of the dead, though nearly weightless in comparison. And his skin was much paler, even by Obo’s standards.
At Seb’s urging, Mandri carried the Mazid back to the makeshift camp in the middle of Minting Rock’s rubble, for that is where Ayram sat.
The giant had his broad back turned, uncovered, and he was sitting on a wooden stool that had been scavenged from wreckage. The witch Elrahet was checking this incredible wall of flesh for wounds. The stool squeaked and groaned every time Ayram shifted his weight, but he was perfectly silent as the old witch sewed up a severe gash that wrapped around his side. As she worked, she washed away the sand from his tightly sculpted skin with a wet rag. The man was animal skinny and strong, and each time he lifted his arm to give Elrahet clearance to scrub, the striations in his shoulders popped and his shoulder blade melted into a pool of rippling muscle.
He glanced over his shoulder and noticed Seb approaching empty handed. “Seb, you soilbucket! Did you find it?” 
Seb ducked under the words with a reverent bow. “When did I never do what I said I was gonna do?”
“Where is it?”
Seb stepped aside to reveal Mandri carrying the Mazid.
“Put it over there,” Elrahet snapped as she pointed with her elbow.
Laying on the ground nearby was the Mazidariga child, dead. Mandri laid Obo down next to it. Both were swaddled in black, with only their faces open to the air. They looked oddly like siblings—their skin had that same cloudy pallor. Obo was the bigger of the two, or he would have been if he hadn’t had his legs chopped off.
Ayram sighed and his shoulders slumped. Then he slapped his knees and stood up, against Elrahet’s protestations. He twisted back and forth to test the stitchwork that riddled his side, and when this sent a thin stream of blood dribbling down his ribs, he stole a long, thin strip of wool from a white Hrkan cloak and bandaged himself up. Elrahet tried to help, but he pointed with his bearded chin towards the twin corpses, Obo and the Riga.
“Go and do it,” he said.
Elrahet grumbled, then waddled over to the corpses and shooed Seb and Mandri aside. She then straightened the bodies out so that they lay flat on their backs, bellies even, and she knelt in between their heads, making sure the skirt of her robe folded nicely to make a pillow for her creaky knees. 
From nowhere, that golden blade flashed in her hands, shining bright in the red light of the setting sun. The sight of it turned Mandri’s stomach.
Elrahet’s head craned towards the sky, and the speech that ushered from her throat was so polluted with guttural urks that Mandri wondered if they were even words. Not even the croaks of vomiting toads sounded so much like her gibberish. After the witch croaked through a garbled verse, she bent low over the Riga child and with her blade she cut the air around it, as if freeing it from some invisible tether, and when that was done she raised her arm and slammed her knife into Riga’s black-robed belly, burying the knife up to the hilt.
The Riga child’s eyes flicked open and bulged as if trying to escape its skull, one red eye twisting left, the other twisting right. Mandri wondered if its brain might be exploding. Then the whole body juddered, and the little legs spasmed, kicking sand onto Ayram’s boot. Elrahet pushed down on the Riga’s hips with her free hand to steady the creature, and when the jerking finally settled down, she ripped the blade from the stomach, bent over the wound, then set her lips upon it.
Every fiber of Mandri’s being wanted to look away from this unholy sight, but he couldn’t—such is the allure of dark and twisted things. The Riga wasn’t human, but it looked enough like an innocent child that Mandri felt shame for staring, and he nearly fainted when the witch slurped up blood from the hole in the Riga’s belly. A trickle of red dripped from her scrunched-up withered lips as she swung around to kiss the lips of Obo. But of course, it was more crude than a kiss—she squeezed Obo’s jaw open, and spit the contents of her mouth into Obo’s throat. Out came blood and chunks of viscera, and so too came a formless gray light, the same glowing ember that Mandri had seen zip out of Obo’s body before the battle of Minting Rock began.
Elrahet shut Obo’s jaw, clenched it tight with her leathery palm, and set to whispering that guttural language into Obo’s ear. She held her dagger aloft Obo’s throat and nicked the air above, seeming to brush Obo’s corpse with her blade as she played at guiding the ember down into his stomach. When she was finished, she set her ear to Obo’s heart, closed her eyes, and listened. 
A stillness settled over those gathered as they waited for something magical to happen.
Then Elrahet’s beady eye snapped wide as if struck by thunder.
“Boy! Quick!” 
Her eye fixed on Mandri and she  waved him towards her.
Mandri hobbled over and she grabbed his wrist then yanked him down to his knees, right next to Obo’s body.
“Squeeze the hand,” she said, and she held up her own bony claw of a hand to demonstrate, clutching some invisible stone and pumping it with her fist.
Mandri held up his hand and did the same.
She slapped him across the cheek.
“The other hand!”
He held up his poulticed wrist. The weedy thing was no longer oozing black. Elrahet reached out with her knife, and with a quick flick she cut through the bandage that held it all together. The poultice meat sloughed off to reveal the nub of his wrist coated, and between the coin-splotches of dried black paste was a web of fresh pink skin. Though it was healed, it looked diseased against his natural brown complexion.
“Squeeze the hand ,” Elrahet said as she rubbed Obo’s chest.
Mandri imagined his severed hand clutching Obo’s heart, and he squeezed with all his invisible might. 
Obo’s ribcage thumped.
Mandri gasped in shock.
He squeezed again, and another thump bumped up.
“Harder,” Elrahet growled.
Mandri’s determination deepened, such that he was no longer breathing. Sweat beaded on his brow, and just when it seemed that he would faint, Obo opened his eyes. 
“Sol’s light,” Mandri muttered. He sat back into his heels and heaved a sigh of relief.
Bleary-eyed Obo slowly glanced around, first to his right, to Elrahet’s sneering visage, then to Ayram’s blood spattered self, then to the black rubble of Minting Rock behind him, and then he squinted at the pile bodies beyond. When he turned his head and saw Mandri, his lips crumpled into a weak smile, broken when Ayram’s great paw gripped Obo’s whole head and lifted the Mazid up to lean him against a rock.
Ayram turned to Mandri and said, “Command it. Make it do something.”
“Do what?”
“Make it hiss like a lizard.”
“The boy is not ready for true work,” said Elrahet. “When his leg is mended, when his mind is steadied, then we shall make him Minder. A more urgent matter threatens our fate.”
“The Mazidariga?”
“Damn right,” said Seb, who was crouching nearby like a sandrat waiting for someone to drop a crumb of bread. Ayram silenced the wiry woman with a sideways glance, then he glowered at Obo and asked, “How many Mazidariga are there?”
“I don’t know,” Obo answered. “More than one. Or rather, more than you can run from. You can be assured you will be hunted until killed. However, there is a peaceable solution to that particular problem which I’m sure you’ll find agreeable.”
“Out with it.”
Elrahet snarled the answer. “The Mazid wants a Spark.”
“Yes, but there is another way around the Riga.”
“How?”
“Before I answer, I’d like to know why you took me captive. Don’t say it was to kill some demon. Do you want me to drive Hrk’s armies into the sea? Lay waste to every Hrkan temple? Kill every Lord? The prospective Lords, too?”
Ayram picked up his spear and began to wipe it with a rag. Both its ends, the chisel and ball, were solid red, as if made of a different metal.
Ayram said, “I don’t want you to kill a Lord. I don’t want you to kill a demon. I want you to kill the Amalgamete.”
“There’s no use in it,” Elrahet grumbled.
Obo was quick to counter her. “I don’t think that’s true. You see, if this is all an act of rebellion, then I am on your side. I would welcome a change in the continent’s leadership. The Lords are weak and fractious. They create more problems than they solve.”
“You aren’t getting a Spark,” said Elrahet brusquely.
“Simmer down, it’s only talk,” said Ayram. “Either it says something sensible, or we ignore it.” He leaned on his spear and asked intently, “How do we elude these Mazidariga demons?”
“Before I get to that, please, stop and consider—what is the one thing the Hrkan Lords are scared of?”
“You?” Elrahet grouched.
“Yes, but no. You see, I was made to help manage that one thing that checks the Hrkan Lords—that is the Hrkan people. You may think that I was made to terrorize you, but the Lords don’t care about the outland tribes. You’re tangential. In fact, they’ve sympathy for you if you can believe it. The guild is the only thing holding the common folk back from stealing what arable lands you people have left. If your goal is to plunge Hrk into chaos, you’ll be signing your own writ of doom.”
Ayram chuckled and shook his head. “I know what the Hrkan people can do.”
“Then why agitate them?” Obo asked. The force of his argument was working an energy into him. If his arms were able to move underneath his swaddling robe, they would have been going mad. “If you want Hrk to fall cleanly, you have to be precise. You needn’t a Mazid to do this. Kill a few choice men and women, the ones keeping the corruption in check, as well as a few others who bridge the nation’s natural divisions. Apply some pressure to the right places, and Hrk will fall apart under its own weight. That would be a more manageable decline. It might take some time, but believe me, Hrk hates itself more than it hates you. Simply get them to no longer want to be a nation, and they won’t be. That will give your outland tribes room to breathe.”
“You speak as if you have experience tearing down kingdoms.”
“How do you think Hrk tore down the Old Jandri world? It wasn’t Mazidfire. Disagreement is the natural impulse of your kind, prey on that, and any nation in the world would spiral into a cycle of death as soon as first blood is drawn.”
“The thing you don’t understand,” said Ayram, “Is that I don’t care about Hrk. I don’t care about the outland tribes. What I do care about is killing the Amalgamete.”
Obo looked deeply into Ayram’s eyes, as if to gauge the man’s sincerity. Mandri, in turn, looked to Elrahet, who was as set in stone as her leader. Seb seemed less convinced of the mission, though she was more difficult to read. It was difficult to know what lay behind her scowl at a glance—it was probably nothing more than a too-sour borcandi spine, as a string of juice was dripping from her lip.
For Mandri’s part, he was alarmed. He’d remembered what Ayram had named the Amalgamete back in the pit-cave—he’d called it a god-swallower.
“I don’t understand,” said Obo, stealing the words right out of Mandri’s mind. “If there’s this great evil running around, why not let Hrk deal with it?”
Elrahet thrust her cane in the air and shouted, “We don’t have time for this!”
Obo squirmed inside his black swaddling robe. “You went through all this, because you need me to kill a demon?”
“It is the Lord of demons.”
“Why not poke it with your spear?”
“It’s very big.”
“How big?”
Ayram leaned on his spear and said firmly, “How do we avoid the Mazidariga?” 
“Well that’s simple,” said Obo. “Actually, the solution was in your grasp just now, but true to form you’ve squandered the opportunity.”
“Out with it.”
“You could capture a Riga after it has whistled the pseudospark out of my body, then you could walk wherever you please unmolested. You would then wake me once you reached your destination.”
Seb stood up and said, “Wait a finger—are you saying that we could have—”
Ayram waved Seb off, but Obo answered her anyway. “Yes, you could have carried me and my poor cousin around the Sand free from the worry of the Hrkan hunt. Or, you could end all difficulties by giving me a Spark.” He mounted his argument before anyone had time to laugh. “One distant whistle from a Mazidariga will end me. If I had my own shard of the divine, then it stands to reason that I would be freed from the Mazidariga’s influence entirely.”
“Free from the hunt,” Ayram muttered.
Elrahet added, “Freed from a Minder as well.”
“Yes,” said Obo. “But if you give me a Spark, you would be giving me my freedom. I said it before and it will always be true—in return for such a gift, I would slay anything you wished.”
Elrahet said, “Tell me, creature, if a true Spark danced in your belly, what would stop you from killing us? What would stop you from violating your word?”
“Nothing,” Obo admitted.
“Behold!” she shrieked. “A truth! None will come as quickly from a puppet’s tongue. I’d sooner trust the creature with a venomed blade than a Spark. We’re better off stumbling blind into a nest of battles.”
Ayram smirked. “We’ll make do without its wisdom. And we should make ready. We’ll have to outpace the Hrks.”
“To where?” Obo asked.
“We make for the bones of Bullr, then we head south to the Goree Mountains.”
Obo was unimpressed. “The Bullr basin is surrounded by Hrkan posts. If there was a lord of demons dwelling anywhere near there, it would have been noticed.”
“The demon isn’t hiding in the bones. It hides in the Goree.”
“Where in the Goree?”
“I don’t know.”
“You don’t know?”
Ayram’s grin spread wide inside the bloody bush of his beard. “This may surprise you, Mazid, but I can know things which I don’t know.”
Obo was not surprised. Neither was Mandri. The biggest of all outland pokes was unable to distinguish between knowledge and gut instinct—this was one of the least surprising things in all of Solraheen’s creation. Also unsurprising was the sad truth that other pokes went along with it. Absurd, but not surprising, as size is certainty in the Sand.
The only surprising bit was Elrahet. This woman had knowledge of the Spark, visions of the future, and yet, she was content to call herself Ayramun. It was because of her that Mandri feared the truth of the Amalgamete, though not just her. He’d now met two witches wielding golden knives, and both speaking of a godlike being. Importantly, they didn’t disagree about this god’s existence, but whether or not it needed to be killed.
Mandri decided that Obo ought to know about that other witch, Pel, the one who’d started him on this journey. Perhaps it might change Obo’s mood if he knew that these pokes weren’t the only ones preaching about an Amalgamete. It might make Obo more amenable to his Minding. If the Amalgamete were real, then all of this might make sense.
He found himself hoping it was real. It would be a real shame for that big pile of bodies to mean absolutely nothing. If it didn’t mean anything, then any old passing artist could stumble by and make it mean whatever they wanted, and that would be a shame.</Text>

            <Title>Dying Pilgrim</Title>
            <Text>Ayram led them to a southeast leading Charnel road called the Hatthir road. There were plenty of pilgrim skeletons lying about the Hatthir road. One of them, it turned out, was still alive. Ayram noticed the man first. He picked up the poor pilgrim and set him the shade of a makeshift tent. The dying pilgrim stared out at all the Ayramun with winkless eyes. His skin was like paper, and his ribs were countable through the window in his yellow haircloth habit.
This pilgrim thought Ayram was Solraheen enfleshed. Ayram did not disabuse him of this notion. He sponged water onto the man’s lips, and the man wheezed out a few final words which no one heard.
Mandri gave the pilgrim a rock he’d found the day before. It was a hollow tube of rock scrubbed smooth by sand. Obo had said it wasn’t a rock, but part of a hardened reed. Whatever it was, it put a passing joy into the pilgrim’s eyes, and Mandri was glad to see it. Then they all moved on to let him die.</Text>

            <Title>Sight Spot</Title>
            <Text>Finding Elrahet was easy because she never moved far from where she sat down, and that morning Seb had seen her sit down at the ambush sight spot. Getting up to her, however, was difficult. Seb could either climb up the steep cliff face, or he could take the long way, and since he had to carry the dead body, he took the long way. He followed the Junei road up into the mouth of the Junei pass, then instead of following that road through the mountains and all the way south to Meskalim, he scrambled off onto a smuggler’s trail which snaked up into the Hias. Before long, he hopped off that trail to follow a path which Ayram had made, one which double-backed towards the east.
It was nearing mid-day when Seb made it to the that wide, mid-cliff ledge where Elrahet was sitting. As far as ambush sight spots go, it was perfect—it offered a privileged view of everything east of the Hias mountains. Below was the mouth of the Junei Pass, out of which the Junei road poured. This unkempt road meandered down into the dark Junei hills, where it was dissected into a filigree of footpaths that wiggled down into the valleys and bent around black screes and outcrops of rock before shooting through the ravines and bowing along the bottoms of the wide, long-dried washes before emptying out, at last, into the Junei plain. Once out on the plain, all roads got lost because the white ground is a rocky caliche that gets swept clean by the strong northerly Junsi wind.
Elrahet was alone up on that high ledge. To Seb’s blurry eyes, she was nothing but a bundle of black rags and long smoky hair. She was sitting cross-legged and looked like she was communing with the vastness of the world, but really, she was sitting, watching, and waiting for a caravan to rumble along so she could put an end to their travels.
“Took you long enough,” she said as Seb approached.
Seb didn’t wait to catch his breath before saying, “Gugi found a dead body and—”
“I know.” 
Seb wondered how she knew, because she hadn’t yet looked at him and what he was carrying. Then he realized that this was, after all, the sight spot, and it had a good angle on just about every ravine, and on top of that, she was a witch. Who knows how far her witchy eyes and witchy ears could reach.
“Bring it here,” she said.
Seb knew bloodwitches were cantankerous creatures, but Elrahet was especially cantankerous. Seb wondered about her age, though numbered age was rarely a thing people of the Sand kept track of. A sand dune has no age, and outland witches like Elrahet were just as elemental. Her features were as dark, sharp, and solemn as any slab of shale. Her sun-drenched skin was as brown, leathered, and wrinkled as the bark of any pepperwood tree. Her layers and layers of black rag-robe pillowed her knobbly frame and made her look like a ragged, perhaps diseased crow. Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the Hias mountains themselves, and probably as old.
“Must I command your every twitch? Put the body down.”
Seb gently put the dead boy down, not wanting to annoy her. He didn’t want her to shoo him away before he’d heard what she might say. It was his great mission in life to hear what she had to say. This was a difficult mission, because not only did Elrahet harbor disdain for mankind in general, she seemed to hate Seb more than most. And why shouldn’t she? She could see the plan. She knew what he was. And when she did speak, she spoke softly, hoarsely. Her throat croaked like a dying man. All her sentiments were brusque and rude. All her sentences were death sentences. 
Then there was her bloodspeech. That’s what Seb called her absent-minded witchy mumbling. He called it bloodspeech because whenever she spoke, his own blood tingled, and as soon as the boy was laid down flat, she set to work probing the body for signs, whispering that cursed bloodspeech as she did.
Her study started with the extremities, the fingers and toes. Then she worked her way up the fore-arms, her fingers tracing veins, and she worked her way over the ankles and up the lower-lower legs. When she got to the dead boy’s knees, she ordered Seb to take off the dead boy’s tunic. This Seb did with some difficulty, as Elrahet was not inclined to help or even move out of the way. Once it was done, and the boy was naked, Elrahet began her study anew.
There was an odd black birthmark on the boy’s chest. Elrahet squeezed it between her bony fingers as if to pop it off. Then she picked through his mop of black hair like a mother looking for lice. Then she cupped his uglies, but there was no great providence there, and next she tucked her thumbs into her palms and set all eight fingers to work in palpating the boy’s belly. When she got to jabbing her fingers up under the boy’s ribs, Seb’s impatience got the best of him—he needed to know what was going on.
“Why don’t ya just cut him open?” he asked bluntly, though he’d forgotten to stop chewing his borcandi spine as he asked it, so his words were a little lost between squelches.
Elrahet looked up at him through her imperious brown gaze, and her incurable sneer strained the tendons in her neck.
“Go busy yourself,” she growled.
Seb stepped back and privately cursed himself for not handling the situation with more tact. He should have expected less. Elrahet was impossible to please. In the first few months of Seb’s journey with the Ayramun, he’d tried winning her over with kindness—he’d make her meals, wash her blankets, carry her things, and for all that she called him a ‘servile oaf’. If he ignored her entirely, that only enraged her. If he did what she wanted, exactly how she wanted it, no more or no less, then he was a ‘mindless poke’. It had been three whole years and as many months, and Seb had learned almost nothing from her.
The only bit of wisdom he’d ever heard her speak was a rather childish aphorism given to Purl. Purl had been pouting about some useless thing and Elrahet said to her, “Every weakness is a strength, and every strength, a weakness.” If anyone else had said something as stupid as that, Seb would have disregarded it as merely twisting words. Strength is strength. Weakness is weakness. Seb’s eyes, for example, were a weakness. If a thing was up close he could keep it sharp, but ‘way far out’ and ‘not too far off’ were smashed together into a blurry haze he called ‘out there somewhere’. He looked out on the Junei plain from that high ledge, and all he saw was a wash of white ground underneath a blur of blue sky.
The only good thing that came of his unreliable eyes was that he never had to stand watch, and while he took special pleasure in not being saddled with that chore, calling that a strength was merely twisting words. When a man is strong he doesn’t need to twist words. For a witch steeped in the mysteries of the all-white Spark to say a thing like that, to say ‘weakness is a strength’, then there had to be some deeper purpose underneath the surface. Elrahet only ever spoke to bend the world to her will. Her words might have been for Purl, but Seb had overheard it, and him overhearing it was no doubt as much a part of  her intentions as if she’d said the words to him directly. She was sending him down a path. Seb was sure of it.
One day Seb realized that the only other person he’d ever known who’d had vision worse than his, was his old aunt Sesha. Old Sesha saw splotches of light and shadow and that was it. But if she stared at a person for long enough, and got all glassy eyed, then she would begin to see bands of radiant color resolving into the outline of the person. She called it aurasight. She saw red or black for killers and thieves and the like, green or blue for gentle folk, gold for the merely curious, and so on. It was an invaluable skill. Her weakness became a strength, and Seb figured that’s how it must work with eyesight—lose sight of the natural world to gain sight of the hidden one.
Whenever he tried to see auras, he’d mimic what he’d seen his old aunt Sesha do. She would stand as still as a statue and stare without focus. She’d get all shaky and sweaty as if she were killing herself with the effort. Seb wasn’t sure what was going on inside her head. It seemed simple, like all she was doing was narrowing the world down to her and her target, and then, through vein-popping concentration, she’d will the auras into existence.
Seb stared out at the Junei plain and tried to find the coming caravan by its aura. He knew the caravan was out there somewhere in that blur, making its way towards the Junei pass to be set upon by the Ayramun. He let his eyes cross just enough so that the white landscape doubled and blurred until the edge between the sand and the sky softened into a clean gradient of white-to-blue. He strained under the effort, and at that point there was nothing else in the world but him and the distant caravan—if it was even there. He supposed it was there, and he supposed that supposing it was there was enough to make its aura flare.
He stared into that blur and bore the look of a man possessed—jaw clenched tight, breathing in sips, skin tingling, muscles tense. He could feel the energy screaming out of his eyes, he was scouring all the world with it. He trembled as old Sesha trembled. Sweat beaded on his brow. 
Then he caught a faint whiff of a curious odor. A foul odor. Was it him? It could be the dead boy. Or old Elrahet. 
He took another sniff and was hit with a familiar musk—it was him.
And there were some nesting brightbeaks, up on the cliff behind. Seb knew this without looking because when brightbeaks jump out of their holes they flap their little wings so hard that it beats a pathetic, warbling whistle out of their tiny chests. One flew right by his ear.
But that brightbeak wasn’t the most distracting thing. That honor went to the way in which the borcandi juice oozed out of the spine tucked in his cheek and welled up in his mouth. Swallowing it all down was difficult because borcandi juice doesn’t play nice with the stomach, so people spit it out. Spitting would break his concentration, but his concentration was already broken, so he spat—he spat out  the whole damn wad. It was as big as his tongue.
“Dammit, Seb! You’re a servant of Shis, I swear it!”
Elrahet’s accusation sent Seb into a flustered panic. He wiped his cheek and prepared to leap to his defense, then was horrified to see a long thin track of green-gray spit lacing across the dead boy’s chest. Thankfully, none of it had touched Elrahet.
“Aw, shit! I’m sorry! Shit. I didn’t mean to.”
He crouched down and tried to atone for his stupidity by wiping the dead boy clean with his dirty sleeve.
Elrahet glowered and said, “Get away afore I have you tossed off the cliff!”
“I didn’t mean it, I’m sorry.”
Elrahet had a short club-like walking cane that she always kept near, and she picked it up and swung it at Seb’s head. He pulled back in time to watch it brush his nose.
She said, “I’m that close to cursing your flesh so it steams your bones.”
“I didn’t mean it. Here, let me—”
She swung again, and her back swing was faster, so fast that her cane head smacked his cheek. If she’d been serious, it might have broken the bone.
Seb clutched his bruised cheek and backed away, thankful it was only a warning, though Elrahet’s withering glare said her patience would not bear another word. 
Seb cursed himself again as he walked away. This was another weakness of his—he was forgetful. He couldn’t hold onto a moment if he were alone in a pitch-black cave. People said this was because of all the spines he chewed, but Seb knew that wasn’t true because he’d always been like this. And he’d never once been in a position where his fitful mind was a strength. Gugi had said that if his mind was always jumping around then at least that means he can’t be sad for too long, and so he should be happy about that, but somehow that wasn’t true—being sad was the one thing Seb could be for too long.
He leaned over the cliff face and spat a loogie down. He watched it fall with some delight, though he was denied the pleasure of seeing it splat on the rocks below because the ground was far enough away to be ‘out there somewhere’.
That’s when Moto came scrambling down to the sight spot from some hidden perch up above.
Seb disliked Moto. Moto, a black man from Zos, was stronger, younger, and more skilled than Seb in every way imaginable. He was too well put together to be an Ayramun. Everyone else made do with dark, patchwork robes and nail-strapped soles for shoes, whereas Moto had thin silver metal buckles on his dusty black boots, and he wore an orange robe that was tucked and folded into sharp knife pleats that slanted across his chest and were kept secured by a wide and tight black sash around the belly. Moto was so clean and fastidious that he would have been at home in the rete of Hrkan Lords. He even had a sword, a long, curved sword inside a brass-studded scabbard—it even had a name. Worse than all this, he had healthy teeth. Few things made Seb more aware of his own disgusting self than being in the presence of healthy teeth. A man is hard done up when a smile does nothing but make him jealous.
Moto surveyed the Junei plain and said to Seb, “You can’t see them, can you?”
The bastard knew he couldn’t see shit. That’s who Moto was—there was a dead boy not ten feet away, an ill omen just discovered, yet here Moto was taking the time to take Seb’s spit right out his cheek.
“I can’t see shit,” said Seb.
Moto chuckled. His was a damned hearty, healthy chuckle. “They’re there,” he said. “They’re on their way. Exciting, isn’t it?” He then looked down at Elrahet, pretending to notice the dead boy for the first time. “And who is that?”
Loath to be interrupted, Elrahet grumbled out a barely-audible answer. “He’s a complication.”
“A complication? What does that mean?”
“Means what it means.”
“Please, I need to know what it means. The Mazid will be here before long.”
Elrahet tore herself from her task and squinted out at the horizon. She said, “I don’t see anything.”
“They’re there,” said Moto as he pointed out into the blur. “There’s a tiny black speck and a faint cloud of dust just there. That would be them. That would be our target.”
“You sure that’s them?” Seb asked.
“Who else could it be?”
“Could be anyone.”
Moto snorted in annoyance, which was a common enough occurrence that some of the Ayramun called him the rutting bull. He said, “Salavan told us that the Mazid and his Minder were making for the pass and the two would be hiding themselves in a blackwood caravan. Salavan said they’d be coming mid-day today.” Moto pointed out to the desert again, this time with two imploring hands. “There’s a caravan out there. It’s mid-day. It all fits. That’s who we’re hunting.”
Seb spat another loogie off the cliff and asked, “Did old Salavan say anythin’ about a dead body?”
“No,” Moto said defensively. “Are you saying something about a dead body?”
“I’m not sayin’ nothin’, I’m lookin’ at it.”
“Yes, I see it too. What I don’t see is why it changes anything.”
“If there’s a curse floatin’ in them hills, then Ayram should know about it.”
“Who said anything about a curse?”
Seb looked to Elrahet for support, but she was in no mood to humor him. She simply grunted and said, “Unexpected bodies are foul omens.”
“Damn right,” said Seb.
Moto snorted again. “Everything is a foul omen to you,” he said. “A rock stuck in your shoe is a foul omen. A dead leaf is foul omen. Unless Elrahet thinks there’s something more here, then it doesn’t change anything.”
“How’s it not change nothin’? How’s findin’ a dead body not put a notch in your noggin?”
“Because I’m a man of resolve, Seb.”
“You don’t even know for sure there’s a Mazid out there in that desert. Could be only merchants and we come out here for nothin’.”
“If it’s only merchants, then we knock off a few fat bellies and we get a little richer. What’s the problem?”
“Could be that those aren’t merchants, but a bunch of Hrkan Skulsi in disguise.”
“If it’s Skulsi, all the better. We’d be killing people worth killing.”
“Could be a Mazid and no Minder, what then? Need both, don’t we? What if it's only one and not the other?”
“Hrks wouldn’t move a Mazid this far out without its Minder. They don’t trust the Mazidai.”
“What if it's a Mazid and a Minder and some Skulsi. What then?”
“A few soldiers won’t change the balance.”
“What if it’s more'n a few?”
“Then we’ll kill more than a few.”
“And how much is that?”
Moto rolled his eyes and pulled a small, red leather purse from out of his robe. Seb’s eyes went wide at sight of it, for inside that pouch was a ribbon of black silk, and folded inside that silk were two smooth rock crystal lenses set inside thick brass rings. These rings were joined together by a dangling chain that when stretched was the length of Seb’s forearm. Seb always itched to try out those lenses, but Moto never let him touch them. Seb hated Moto for that. If those two lenses, set in array, could magnify the distance and make the horizon seeable, well, Seb wanted to have a look.
Moto sat down on the edge of the cliff and propped his elbow up on one knee and let his other leg dangle free. He hunched over, put the smaller lens up to his eye, then stretched out the other lens as far the chain would let, and began his squinting study of the distant blur.
Seb didn’t like that Moto was sitting that way. It wasn’t just the lenses, it was the casual disregard for what Seb was capable of doing. In a flash, Seb could be right behind him and push him off the cliff. Seb could end him right there. For all of Moto’s skill and style, Seb could end him here. There were plenty of moments like this when Seb could do it. Could do it while Moto slept. While he ate. Seb had half a mind to do it right now.
“I count fifty-four of them. Give or take.”
“Fifty-four’s more’n most,” said Seb.
“And fifty-four is exactly how many Salavan said there’d be—though there is an odd fix about them.”
“An odd fix?”
Moto squinted again. He was evidently having trouble keeping his quarry in focus.
“It’s like they’re…well…they’re a standard caravan guard alright, but it’s like they’re marching in squares.”
Seb didn’t know much, but he knew one thing for certain—Moto’s expectations were getting in the way of the truth. And one other thing he knew for certain was the proof. “There ain’t no caravan guard that keeps a column,” he said.
“That’s why I say it’s an odd fix.”
“It’s an odd fix ‘cause they ain’t no caravan guard.”
“Eight wagons,” Moto added. “Exactly how many Salavan predicted.” 
Seb screwed up his face in thought. Eight wagons was several more than the average merchant train. Predicted, maybe. But a merchant guard marching in tight formation? Caravan hands in this part of the Sand were ragged bands of backwash from distant Hrkan conquests, not the kind to march in squares.
These were Skulsi, Seb was sure. Fifty-four Skulsi and a god-damned Mazid were bearing down on them. And how many more men might be hiding in those wagons? Thirty?
Seb compared all this to what the Ayramun brought to bear—forty-three bows. Forty-three bows and Ayram. And old Elrahet. Against anyone else he liked the odds, but nobody tangled with a Mazid with good reason—the thing could wipe out armies. Their only hope was the element of surprise. The Junei hills were a decent place to bushwhack a column of Hrks. Everywhere the slopes were steep, and no matter which particular route was taken into the pass there were places where a strong arm would have a clean shot at the whole enemy column—that’s assuming the whole column was dumb and tried to stuff through all at once, but Skulsi weren’t dumb. Against fearful men, an ambush here would be a slaughter. Against experienced warriors, Seb was not so sure. Add a Mazid, if the Mazid was ready...Maybe the odds three to one against. And that’s assuming the Mazid got taken down without too much trouble. 
Moto said, “I’d take them for Skulsi, but even from here you can see they’re wearing the stingy brown wool of blackwood guards.”
“Could be they been drilling common hands,” said Seb.
“That could be.”
“Could be those really are Hrkan troops.”
“But they’re wrapped in brown wool,” said Moto.
“So? A man can change his clothes.”
Moto shook his head. “A Skulsi doesn’t drop his whites for convenience, not even for subterfuge. It’d be a black mark.”
“The Sand makes converts of us all,” said Elrahet. 
Moto let go of his outstretched lens and watched it dangle on its chain. “Pride,” Moto noted through a plaintive sigh, “Is the only thing a Skulsi has. Once a soldier earns the white robe, he’s not going to take it off.” He then acceded a shrug and added, “Still, even if they’re wearing brown, they could be fighting men.”
Seb said, “They could be rabble, and they could be eighty Skulsi.” 
“I said fifty-four.”
“What about them wagons? Could be more of ‘em hidin’ in them wagons. And if they’re Skulsi, then they got skin in the game.”
Elrahet was thinking the same. “They won’t run when the killing starts,” she said.
“And the way we’re set up—”
“I know,” said Moto. “This only works if they try to run. But this is a game of risk. This is a Mazid we’re dealing with. The Skulsi hardly matter.” 
“Then it’s decided,” Seb said. “It’s off.”
“It’s not for you to call, Seb. Sol’s light knows you’d be the last person allowed to make that call.”
“You ain’t shit either.”
“That’s where you’re wrong. Ayram put me in charge.” He stood back up to make sure Seb got the full measure of him. “And like it or not, this is the only opportunity we’ll have to catch us a Mazid and his Minder, and men marching in formation isn’t enough to call it off.”
“What about the dead body?”
“What about it?”
Seb was stumped. Moto wasn’t the type to go in for intuition unless it was his own. He might listen to Elrahet, but she wasn’t saying squat. In fact, she was remarkably passive considering the circumstances. Her skin was so lined with age that even the subtlest action of her brow would send it cracking into sharp relief, and at the moment there was only the faintest hint of that familiar sneer. She was watching, though, watching like she already knew what was about to happen.
Moto asked Elrahet, “How did the boy die?”
Elrahet pointed to the boy’s neck and said, “Bruises.”
“He was strangled?”
She nodded. 
Seb stepped over and knelt next to the boy’s head. There was a story written on the boy’s face that Seb couldn’t read. There simply weren’t enough clues. The boy’s lips were ashen and cracked, but overall he didn’t look water-starved. His skin looked like it had never seen a sun-blister. His dark brown eyes bore that calm expression of death, serene, the kind of rested ease that Seb desperately wanted but wasn’t willing to go that far to get. 
“Wish I could figure what he’s doin’ here,” Seb said. 
“His body doesn’t look too spoiled,” said Moto. “Elrahet could always try and bring him back. Then he could tell us himself what he’s doing out here.”
Seb looked to Elrahet with eager eyes—watching the old witch work magic on a Spark was first and foremost amongst his desires. “Yeah, bring him back!”
The suggestion sent Elrahet sneering all the deeper. “Why don’t you do it yourself?” she said, each word laced with derision.
Moto smirked. “Yeah, Seb, do it yourself. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be bagging a Mazid and remaking the world.”
“If this don’t work out, an’ Ayram finds out there’s a dead body up here that you didn’t let him know about, then I’m blamin’ you. It’ll be your fault. Your fault.”
“Yes, that’s how responsibility works. Now, those wagons will be here before long, so get back down there and do your job.”
Moto then pinched a flat stone finger whistle between his lips and whistled the song of the Jek Tresset to let the Ayramun hidden in the valleys below that the ambush was on. He stabbed and fluttered the high notes to encourage haste. Twittered replies sprang up from the hills below, and then, without so much as a parting nod, he set off down the path that led into that maze of mounded clay and rock.
Elrahet was keen to leave too. She stood up and shuffled down the path after Moto, though she wasn’t headed down into the hills. She was headed to her witchy little cave to conjure a blanket of fog the likes of which the Junei hills hadn’t seen for an age—a nice impenetrable fog to lay cover for the ambush. Damn it all if Seb wasn’t going to follow her and watch how she did it.
He had to keep his distance though. Following Elrahet, he’d learned, was difficult on account of her witchy senses. He had to be completely out of sight, and far enough out of sound that a crunch of pebbles underfoot wouldn’t give him away. It would have been impossible to follow her at all if he didn’t already know where she was going. The night before, he’d searched around for her cave and found it—a thin crack in the base of a giant sloping slab of granite that constituted the greater part of a mountain peak. It was a bit of a climb to get to it, and Seb wanted desperately to see how the old witch managed it, but that’d be too risky. He had to wait. He waited until the sun was sitting in the middle of the sky, and then he ventured after her.
When he made it to the cave crack, he could hear Elrahet’s faint mumblings echoing out. He shuffled inside and saw, illuminated by a shaft of light, old Elrahet squatting over the corpse of a sizable black-backed lizard. 
The beast was belly up, and Elrahet’s fingers were already knuckle deep in its guts. Her arm twisted and twirled and her lips whispered incantations as her upturned eyes searched the blue sliver of midday sky that peeked through the crack in the rock above.
Then she turned and set her old blue eyes on Seb.
He stumbled backwards in fright and bumped his head on a rock and howled in pain.
“Damn!”
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, then she set her eyes back on the sky, and put her hand to work again in the lizard’s corpse.
She lowered her voice to a whisper
Seb strained to hear her garbled words.
“Em bestet buguul.”
When the words were echoed and gone, she looked down at her handiwork and said, “Em bestet shemuul.” 
She pushed down hard with her palm to squeeze the last meal out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Shefre gor, amkukre dor.” 
Her knotted fingers kneaded the intestines. 
“Shefre gor, zomgagor.”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up into the air.
“We would be dust without it.” 
She dropped the entrails back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within.
Seb waited with bated breath for a sight of a Spark, or some effervescent swirl of glowing smoke, or anything, but nothing happened.
Elrahet snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s white belly wider. Into the hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, and then pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin. The lizard’s belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Its gummy tongue popped out of its shovel mouth. Right when Seb supposed that the thing had come back to life, it went limp again. Elrahet pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh.
“It is possible,” she said in a quiet whisper loud enough for Seb to hear, “that the beast is infertile.”
Seb ventured over. It seemed she was talking to him. There was no one else.
“This won’t work?” he asked as he knelt across from her.
“Not with this beast.”
Seb poked the lizard’s corpse with a curious finger. He could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-gray intestines inside seemed to writhe and pulse like a knotted mass of worms.
“What are you gonna do?” he asked.
Elrahet hissed at his impudence, then said, “I need a fertile stomach.”
She looked at Seb’s stomach.
“Fresh blood from a fertile stomach,” she said.
Seb’s skin went cold at the insinuation.
“How about the dead boy? Maybe that’s why we found him. Solraheen dropped him there for this purpose.”
“You are also here,” she said. “You are right here in my cave during my time of need. Did Solraheen not also provide you to me without my seeking?”
“My blood’s no good.”
“Quit your bellyaching and give me your arm.”
“My arm?”
“The arm.”
“Thought you were gonna cut out my stomach. How much blood do you need?”
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given, least of all for magic. There’s no telling what a witch might do with it. But this was a golden chance to get in with the old woman and he had to take it. He studied her countenance to gauge her sincerity. Even in direct light, the difference between Elrahet’s smile and her frown was almost imperceptible under her sneer. It was common belief amongst the Ayramun that Elrahet never smiled at all, but Seb knew that wasn’t true. He’d seen her smile. He knew what it looked like. She wasn’t smiling now. 
“Your arm,” she said.
Seb rolled up his sleeve and extended his arm. Elrahet grabbed his wrist and Seb nearly wretched because her whole arm was still dripping from lizard blood. He also didn’t care for the way she seemed to relish the sight of his veins bulging under his brown skin.
Seb thought his blood was potent. He thought she’d only need a prick. She was only going for a fog after all, not a mountain storm. In truth he didn’t have the slightest idea how this all worked, but if it took more than prick of human blood for a fog, then what would it take for a mountain storm?
He shuddered at the thought. Elrahet felt this shudder in her fingers, and when she felt it, she smiled. It caught Seb off-guard for it was more than a crick in the corner of the lip, it was a full-on, nearly toothless grin.
Seb asked again, this time with more than a hint of unease, “How much do you need?” 
Elrahet’s smile faded and that mess of aged lines settled back into her familiar sneer. She pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from out of the shadows beside her and laid them between herself and Seb. Then she unsheathed a long, thin golden knife from her belt and held it’s curve length-wise along Seb’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said, without affection.
“Same.” 
Elrahet savored the returned courtesy, then pricked her dagger’s tip into his flesh and flicked her wrist with expert care to open the vein. Seb remained stoic through the sting but he watched with grave concern as blood streamed out of the wound and ran around his wrist and over Elrahet’s knuckles as it flowed steadily down into the bowl.
After what seemed an eternity, he jerked his arm free. 
“That’s it,” he said firmly, and he held his hand up and pinched the wound closed with his thumb.
“Your gift is humbling,” said Elrahet, “Yet the bowl is but half-full.”
“That should be enough.”
“Is it?”
“I’ve heard it said that a poor witch blames her tools.”
Elrahet scowled. “Who told you that?” she asked.
“You’re not the only witch I’ve known.”
Elrahet grumbled as if she were about to bark and bite. 
Seb backed away.
When next she spoke her voice was thick with contempt. 
“Think better of where you sit on the scales of the Ayram’s mercy. I could have your stomach for a bag.”
She tossed the scrap of linen at Seb’s face and shooed him out with a flick of her finger.
Seb cursed himself yet again, because not only did he spoil whatever goodwill he thought he’d earned, but he’d let her prick his right wrist, his pulling wrist. Every pull of the bowstring in the coming ambush would bring a twinge of pain. </Text>

            <Title>Pit Cave</Title>
            <Text>The spitting, scrawny man walking in front of Mandri, the one carrying the ‘unconscious’ Mazidobo, his name was Seb. The man walking behind Mandri, the short and stout man whose bread wasn’t baked all the way through, his name was Hill, and according to Hill, these two names were the only two things that Mandri needed to know. Don’t bother with ‘why’, or ‘what is going on’, or ‘I can’t see where I’m going’, no, the only thing that mattered was that Seb was in front and Hill was behind and that was the way things were going to be. If Mandri did so much as breathe too loudly for Hill’s comfort, that was sufficient cause for an open handed smack on the back of the head.
It was impossible for Mandri to not make noise because sound carried well in the pitch-black tunnel, and Mandri’s once-dead-legs were as stiff as rods so every step begged a groan. Every bend of knee felt like a spiked trap exploding into his thigh. Instead of striding through the dark like Hill wanted him to, Mandri shuffled through it on sensitive feet, doing what he could to avoid the trash that littered the floor, and that was hard to do too, because the tunnel was a dumping ground.
There was a horde of trash piled all the way up the low ceiling. It was not a place for unshod feet. And things hid in the shadows of the dancing torchlight—picked-clean bones of small animals, splintered balkanut like shattered skulls, perhaps a few shattered skulls as well littered amongst the curved clay shards of wasted jars and all manner of organic waste, the worst of which were the cold and gooey lumps of muck that glistened when they welled up in between Mandri’s toes—Mandri couldn’t figure what this substance was until Hill stepped in it, too.
“Gods damn it be! Seb, was this you?” Hill was pointing down at a dark stain that soured the toe of his hard leather boot.
Seb paused his march and turned around. He shoved Mandri aside so he could get an eye on it.
“Course not,” he protested.
“Why can’t you shit in the hole like everyone else?” Hill challenged.
“I told you, it wasn’t me.”
“It’s always you.”
“It was Choppa’.”
Hill let loose a frustrated sigh. “It’s always you or Chopper, and since this shit is half green, that means it’s you.”
Seb turned a cold shoulder to Hill’s indignation, and started off again into the dark. Hill nudged Mandri to follow.
Seb said, “Don’t play no blame games with me, Hill. Who’s the one pilin’ up all this trash up in here, huh? Ya know there’s a hole for all this, too, but ya’ll too lazy, aren’t ya? Get yourself together afore you come and pick on my habits.” 
Seb wrapped up his complaint with a snort, and he readjusted Obo’s dead weight to accommodate a hefty harrumph. 
Mandri followed along timidly. He searched the flickering ground for a clean edge of stone to scrape his shit-stained foot against. This tunnel was the most loathsome place that he had ever seen. Black moldy growths pickled the ceiling. It was cramped tight with so much stuff and yet not one thing in it was whole. With each step Mandri was becoming more and more convinced that he was back in the good old world because this was life in all its crummy lived-in-ness.
It wasn’t until the trio left this rubbish tunnel and spilled out into a cleaner, roomier tunnel that Mandri was sure—this was an old cave system, not some corridor of Shis. On one side of this tunnel was a store of chopped lumber, and stacked crosswise on the other were plump canvas bags branded with a black Hrkan sunrose compass. Strewn on the floor in between this stolen grain and the firewood was all manner of toe-jamming obstructions—beer pots, sweetgrass baskets, holey-soled and stringless leather boots, a bundle of crude arrows propped up inside a beer pot, more beer pots. Seb picked his way around all this junk as if he’d placed each piece himself, like a pampered toddler waddling through scattered toys, and on his shoulder, slung like a freshly slaughtered sty-pig, was Mazidobo. His unfortunate nose bobbed in and out of Seb’s armpit with every step.
 It was hard to believe anyone could bring a Mazid down so low, and that these two boorish bandits were involved was inconceivable. Seb was as unimposing as an outland poke could be, dirty and hungry looking, with sunken eyes. He looked like desperation itself more than a man, and he wasn’t the dangerous kind of desperation either. He looked like the sad kind of desperation that Mandri could defeat by simply looking away.
Mandri looked behind at Hill. Hill had his plump pinky finger stuck halfway up his own nose, digging for gold.
Mandri grimaced. “Leave some for me,” he said to Hill.
Hill 's eyes flashed, his cheeks flushed, and he gave Mandri a rude but pulled punch in the ribs.
“Get going!” he shouted. Mandri got going. He took two steps, and when that wasn’t hurried enough, Hill shoved him in the back as if that would help. Mandri’s stiff legs couldn’t cope with the sudden shove and he tumbled forward into Seb’s hips. Seb went sprawling, and so did Mazid Obo. The three of them tumbled together into the glinting darkness.
“Whore’s breath!” Seb shouted at Hill. “You a pokey old tacko, ain’t ya?!”
Seb pushed himself up to his feet. He glared down at Mandri and his eyes looked intent on killing.
Hill rushed by them both, and his torch flame whipped behind like a flag.
Mandri and Seb both looked after Hill in bewilderment. Just beyond the stout man was the bald, pale, and naked Obo fleeing into the darkness. Hill wavered briefly at the sight of Obo’s exceptional agility, for the Mazid looked part lizard as he leaped from rock to wall to the ceiling, and bound back again. Hill shouted back towards Seb, “Go get Ayram!” and then he charged on again into the dark.
Seb stood still, dumbfounded, and watched the chase until Hill’s torchlight disappeared around a bend. They were left in the dark.
“Shit,” Seb muttered.
 A robe-swish later and Mandri felt the cold iron point of a dagger prod his back.
“Don’t you think about tryin’ nothin’ stupid,” said Seb
“I won’t.”
“What’d I say about talkin’? Now get movin’!”
Mandri stood up and he started to move in the direction he supposed Seb’s dagger wanted him to go. The two of them walked like this, bumbling through the pitched-black dark, toes and knees crashing into whatever happened to be in their way. Eventually they came to yet another tunnel, one which gave way to the blinding light of day. When Mandri stumbled out into the sunlight’s warmth, he couldn’t see a thing.
Thankfully, Seb’s dagger disappeared, and Mandri’s aching legs took the opportunity to collapse. Instead of slamming into rock, his knees splashed into warm, soothing sand. He dug his hands into it. It was so damn comfortable compared to the chill of the caves. He wanted to wriggle into it like a sand flea.
“Where is Ayram!?” Seb shouted.
“Ayram’s not here,” said a gruff voice. 
“Then where is he?”
“He’s back inside.”
Mandri felt a brush of air as Seb darted back into the cave.
Mandri tried to blink out the burned-in image of day which occluded the world from view. It faded into a fainter white. He looked up, and there was a circle of blue sky above him, and when he looked back down at the world around it became clear that he was encircled by tall walls of white stone that rose up a good fifty feet. He was sitting at the bottom of a colossal limestone bucket, a pit cave, and the prenoon sun angled it’s light down the sides of this bucket, leaving Mandri’s half of the pit in a dusty, radiant glow, and the other half in a crescent shadow which glowed with warmth from from all the reflected light.
There were dark figures milling about in that warm shadow, some standing, some sitting. They were all looking at him. He was kneeling like an idiot in a spotlight of sand.
One of them stepped forward into the sunlight—a dark Zosan woman. Her smooth face was framed by a white headscarf that was wrapped tight, with one end hanging down and wrapped around the neck. The rest of her figure was shrouded to the ankles by a beige robe. It was a clean and simple look, and despite the wear and tear that spoke of a life roughing it out in the Sand, the woman wore it all with a hint of regal bearing, for she held her shoulders in a kind of self-important swoop that showed she’d been trained in the art of woman-standing-still. 
Her voice was as uncompromising as her posture. 
“You’re the dead boy,” she said. 
Yes, Mandri was the dead boy. It was such a simple matter of fact, but the way she said it made it seem like it was some keen insight that was obvious only to her. 
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. He was anxious not to appear ruffled. He sat back on his heels and contemplated standing up but decided against it because he wasn’t sure if his legs could manage it.
“I am Moteah,” said the woman. She wrinkled her nose as she looked down at Mandri. He supposed she could smell death on him.
“That man who brought you out here,” she said.
“Seb?”
“Yes, Seb. Do you know why he was in a hurry?”
“Uh, well… I think your other prisoner escaped.”
“The Mazid?”
“Yes.”
The word was hardly out of Mandri’s mouth when three scraggly men, all wrapped up in deep desert fashion, leapt to their feet and sprinted across the sand towards Mandri. In five strides they brushed right past him, and on the sixth they disappeared into the dark tunnel, leaving behind a cloud of sparkling dust swirling against the blackness of the cavern depths.
Moteah turned to others gathered, and said to them, “Someone get the boy fit for walking.” Then she ran into caves.
“Get him fit for a dog’s dick,” said a grumbling voice.
“Oh, shut up Spiddy.”
“You shut up.”
“No one’s to mess with the boy until Ayram’s sussed him out.”
The woman who’d come to Mandri’s defense was a silver-haired, athletic woman who looked like one, or both, of her parents was a desert fox. She said, “My name’s Forty.”
“I’m Mandri.”
“Yeah, whatever.”
Forty puffed herself up and said, “I shouldn’t have to say this, but things being what they are—no one touches a hair on this prick’s head unless Ayram says so.”
She nodded towards Mandri. A few unhappy grunts followed.
“Now,” Forty said, continuing to address the shadows, “Who’s got Papi’s clothes?”
When no one answered, Forty stamped her foot and said, “The boy needs robes before we set out and Papi’s will fit. So, who’s got ‘em?”
“Come on, Forty—Papi’s not been dead two days.”
“So? Do you think he cares what happens to his clothes?”
“I care.”
“Did you take his clothes, then, Belk?”
“No. Tob did.”
Forty turned to a lounging shadow tucked right inside the bottom swerve of the pit’s crescent shadow. She motioned for Mandri to follow her into the shade and so he did.
 In that  shadow’s edge was a burly man stretched out amongst a couple burlap sacks. This man’s head was a wiry bush of black, for between the beard, brows, and hair there was hardly a splotch of skin. There was a mouth in there somewhere because sticking out of it was a smoking pipe of freeweed. 
This man, Tob, was propped up on one elbow. He took one look at Mandri and said, “The bastard can freeze and burn for all I care.”
Forty sauntered over to the limestone wall and sat down next to this irascible bush of a man. “This is Tob,” she said.
Mandri nodded.
Tob grunted.
“Tob is an idiot,” Forty said.
“Oh, come off it,” Tob moaned.
“Are those Papi’s clothes?” she asked as she pointed to the bundle of clothes that lay between Tob’s elbow and armpit.
Tob patted the bundle with care and said. “They are. Make a nice pillow, don’t they?”
“Let’s have ‘em.”
“The only way the boy here is gettin’ them is if Ayram commands it.”
“Give them here,” said Forty, undeterred. 
“Woman. What did I just say?”
“You want to explain to Ayram why the boy isn’t ready to go when he gets out here?”
Tob took a long, thoughtful drag from his pipe, let the smoke swirl around with his thoughts, then finally relented.
“Alright.”
The man pulled the bundle of clothes out from under his bushy bulk, and made to undo the string that wrapped it all together, grumbling as he did it. “You know, last I checked we was called the Ayramun, not the Fortyun.”
“Never said we was.”
Tob gave up trying to undo a troublesome knot, and he tossed the wrapped bundle of clothes at Mandri’s feet. “Go on,” he said. “But you need be remembering who those clothes belong to.”
“I’ve heard,” said Mandri. “They’re Papi’s.”
“No.” Tob scowled. “They’re Ayram’s. Everything is Ayram’s here. Clothes on my back. Those clothes there at your feet. The food that’s coming to your belly. It’s all loaned out, if you like. Everything’s Ayram’s, not yours, not Moteah’s, and not Forty’s either. So don’t get confused by the way this woman act.”
Mandri picked up the bundle. He pulled at the plaited hemp string and unrolled the clothes onto the ground. There was a thin brown woolen robe that was crumpled with salt and sweat, and a loose fitting cowl, brown, with a diamond pattern of beige sewn down the sides. There was also a pair of rawhide boots that, when he put them on, seemed cut perfectly to size. It was all in good shape, too, though the robe had a blood stain around the collar, and there was a splotch of blood running along the length of the left arm and a thin stream of it running all the way down the left side.
When Mandri finally had it all on, Tob looked him up and down with a peculiar stare and said, “That’s what Papi wore when he got killed.”
“Yeah, I figured.”
Tob blew a puff of smoke in Mandri’s direction.
Mandri said, “I take it you’re not comfortable with me wearing this?”
“Like the woman said, Papi’s dead. He don’t want em.”
Mandri could feel the rest of the Ayramun glaring at him.
“I don’t know,” he said, “It seems, uh, it seems a bit rude to be wearing these.”
“Ain’t it, though?” said a voice in the shadow behind.
“Oh screw off,” said Forty. “It doesn’t matter.”
Mandri looked down at the bloodstained sleeve. “Really, I’m fine with just my tunic,” he said.
“Won’t be fine when we head out into the Sand,” said Forty. “That tunic would leave your legs in sunboils.”
“Hell of a lot wrong with Papi’s robes too,” Tob said. “Those clothes have got bad luck knitted right into them.”
“Don’t start,” said Forty.
“This ain’t a matter of startin’ and stoppin’. Those clothes are plain bad luck. That’s how it is.”
Moteah groaned and Tob’s caterpillar brow winked at Mandri and he said, “Women don’t know about luck, do they?”
“I don’t either,” said Mandri. “I don’t have any luck.”
“That’s a lie. You gotta be the luckiest prick this side of Shis.”
“Am I?&quot;
“Number of people lucky enough to die and get found fresh-dead by us Ayramun is, like, what? Two people managed it? You lucky as a prince to be standin’ there alive.”
“I guess.”
“What were you doin’ out there in the hills anyway?”
“I have no idea.”
A large brutish man, larger than Tob and with a face that looked like it’d been broken in half said, “I’ll tell you what he was doin’. That boy there’s a curse. Sun as my light, that boy there is gonna get us all killed.”
“That so?” Tob asked.
“Seb didn’t jus’ find him dead in the hills. He found him in the same damn ravine we was ambushin’. An look what happened—more n’ half of us dead.”
“That so?”
“It’s so.”
Forty intervened yet again and said, “We were dealing with a god damned Mazid and eighty something Skulsi. We were always gonna lose people. This little shit had nothing to do with it.”
“We woulda lost less if it weren’t such a shitshow, and you tell me, how’d things go down that way?”
“I’ll tell you,” said Tob.
Forty rolled her eyes and said derisively, “Let me guess—we got unlucky?”
“Damn right.”
Near Tob’s belly was a leather pack and he reached down into it and pulled out a bright brown brassy pouch the size of his fist. He loosened the string that kept it closed and revealed to Mandri an assortment of rocks and pebbles inside. “Take one of my rocks.”
“Don’t,” said Forty.
“These are lucky rocks, boy,” said Tob. “Count yourself blessed. They be small measures of luck, but they do in a pinch—not that a lucky boy like you needs them.”
“How do you know they’re lucky rocks?” Mandri asked as he looked over the stones pretending to be impressed. 
“They’ve been tested,” Tob said. “You pick a rock up, try to do somethin’ with it, then see what happens. If it works, good chance is the thing is lucky. If it works ten times over, then its been tested.”
“I see.”
“I keep the unlucky rocks, too,” Tob continued. “They’re not as good as a curse pot, but if someone gets to pesterin’ you, slip one of these bad boys into their pocket.” Tob then took another pouch from out of his things, and opened it to reveal another bunch of rocks. Each of these had a white ‘X’ scratched into them. Tob picked one of them up and smiled at Forty while he thumbed its grooves.
“Little stones of retribution. Ever find one of these babies in your shoe, Forty?”
Forty simply shrugged.
Mandri asked Tob, “If a rock is lucky, how does that make me lucky?”
“Don’t get him started,” Forty said, but the question had hooked Tob with ease.
“It’s like peelin’ paint—”
“Tob,” said Forty, interrupting. “You're the unluckiest bastard in the world.” She turned to Mandri and nodded towards Tob like he was a sideshow. “He hides his face in all that hair cause he’s so damned ugly. And guess how he got those scars.”
Mandri shrugged.
“The man got his head chewed up by a keenkedra.”
“But I survived!” Tob proclaimed. “Who has touched tongues with a full-grown keenki and lived to tell about it? No one! None but me. And why? ‘Cause of my stones.”
“You’re lucky you survived, but you were unlucky as uglies to ever get swallowed in the first place.”
“That’s the thing, though!” Tob exclaimed, his left eye wide with excitement, revealing to Mandri that under all that hair, the right side of his face was paralyzed. Something like that is usually obvious from the way the lips skew when a person speaks, but Tob’s mouth was little more than a hole in that brush of a beard, and while that hole did skew, the right side had an excuse for not moving as it was busy supping on his pipe.
“You need some bad luck to really know about luck,” said Tob. “It’s the always-lucky that don’t know a thing about luck because they don’t need to. They don’t step in any holes and they get to believin’ that holes don’t exist. But I’ve stepped in all the holes. I know my way around them by now. I’ve got Luck mapped out as well as anybody who ever lived.”
“That does make sense,” said Mandri.
“No it doesn’t,” said Forty.
Tob brushed her off and said to Mandri, “If I shoot an arrow at you, what says whether or not it kills you?”.
“Luck?”
Forty cut in again and said, “Luck has nothing to do with it. It’s skill.”
“It’s luck!” Tob retorted. “Skill says whether or not you hit the target. You aim at the neck, and if you’re skilled, you hit the neck. Luck says whether it rips through the pipes or only scratches the throat.” As proof of his words, Tob brushed up his beard reveal, lurking under a scraggle of neck hair, a long white scar that wrapped around his throat.
“Looks like someone tried to chop your head off,” said Mandri.
Right after Mandri said this, a shorter, stunted bald man who’d been snoozing away perked up and shouted, “Chop!?”
“No!” said Tob with expressive hands. “No chop. No chop today.” 
“Chop?” the bald man asked again.
“No chop.”
The bald man pouted and lay back down. As soon his head hit his packy pillow he was snoozing again.
Tob turned to Mandri and said, “Don’t say that word around Chopper unless you need something chopped. And if you need something chopped you better find him and let him do it—or else. Anyways, like I was sayin’, the arrow that did my neck was shot from only twenty paces. Busted right through me. And that arrow came from a Scweeman no less—as skilled as any here with a bow. But he couldn’t beat my luck, and half my luck is these stones. I’d wager more than money that my stones is what saved me. ‘Cause Forty is right, my natural luck is shit. It’s only cause of these stones that I’m here talking to you now.”
With that said, everyone settled down, and Mandri sat down next to Forty because she seemed to be the only person who would tolerate him. 
“Better get used to waiting,” she said. “It’s half of what we do around here.”
“And who is we?”
“We’re the Ayramun. Well, you aren’t. You can if you want to be.”
Tob overheard and said, “That’s not up to him.”
“Yeah, whatever,” said Forty.
From then on no one spoke. They all sat and waited in that crescent shadow. Mandri was thankful for the quiet. It gave him time to think about how in Solraheen’s name these people—these people—had killed eighty-something Skulsi and captured a Mazid. On top of that, they’d brought his own Spark back into his body. There was something strange happening here, and for the first time ever, he came to admit that somebody else must have a better idea of what was going on. The only thing he knew for certain was that someone wasn’t sitting on their haunches here in this hell hole. Perhaps it was Ayram.
So Mandri sat and waited for this great man to make his entrance.</Text>

            <Title>Ambush</Title>
            <Text>Seb hated the waiting that came before an ambush. The future was coming and with it came death or glory, so it was hard not to get excited and make expectations. He dreamed of death and glory. He’d been anticipating the moment for days. His expectations were built up so high that they’d gone past giddy excitement and had hardened into a sense of impending doom, such that he felt certain he was going to die. He reminded himself that he felt that way during the last ten big ambushes, and yet he came out alive. But there were Ayramun who’d been through it twenty times and died on the twenty first. It was horrible, this feeling. Having to sit with this fear for so long made it worse to be the ambusher than the ambushee. Travelers in the Sand might be expecting to encounter some gang of hard-up outland pokes, but they expected to live through it or they never would have set out in the first place. Death comes as a surprise for them, and their dread is short lived. It wouldn’t be close to what Seb went through. Those people were lucky they died so quickly.
But maybe they weren’t lucky. It might be true that the only thing that matters is what the mind is like at the exact moment of death, because when the Spark drops out of time, who knows, those last thoughts might be crystallized for all eternity. If one’s last moment is agony then it’s agony forever. For the lucky it's a deep sleep. For folks who get ambushed in the desert, if a sharpened point of iron implants itself in the forehead and scratches the right lobes, that look of shock and surprise gets fixed on the skull and it sets hard as stone. There’s not much comfort in the fact that these terrified expressions eventually get wiped away when some gummy mouthed, flat faced lizard waddles in and chews it up, because by that point the Spark is already good and gone.
If it were true, it could happen to Seb. That was a real worry. This particular ambush was feeling more risky than most. The plan to take out the Mazid and its Minder had to play out exactly as expected, or else all the Ayramun would be killed. If a Mazid were free to run amok amongst them, they would be killed no doubt. A Mazid could wipe out an entire army by itself. And even if they did take the Mazid down cleanly, there’d be the fifty-to-eighty men of unknown prowess that needed killing. If they were Hrkan Skulsi, that would be too much. 
Fifty-to-eighty Skulsi.
Maybe ninety.
There were only forty three Ayramun with fifteen arrows each. Seb’s rule of thumb was that arrows go roughly three-to-one, misses to hits—depending, of course, on the skill of the archer. He didn’t have an aptitude for numbers, but it seemed like there weren’t enough arrows. It would be close, and close was dangerous. And their arrows were a kind of shit—the tips were lizard’s teeth reinforcing a hardwood point. The shafts were a strong, close-grain wood, but that made them too stiff. A band doesn’t live long in the desert if they’re always scraping by. 
He knew he wasn’t the only one worried about it all because the rest of the Ayramun were quiet as declawed cats. Even the three lizard brothers who never stopped joking around, they were quiet. Ambushes usually weren’t an exception for them. A gold caravan could be passing right by and they’d find humor in risking everyone’s discovery by tumbling a stone down a rocky slope, or blundering a fart and then claiming later that they couldn’t help it. Even these idiots were keeping low and moving slowly, naught but skinny shadows being whipped to and fro by Moto’s whistled calls though the Junei hills. 
There was no forgiving horsing around because the rumor was that a Mazid’s eyes were as good as Moto’s rock crystal lenses, and a Mazid’s ears were as good as a spade-eared bat. That caravan was close enough now that if a Mazid truly was in their midst then his superfine senses would uncover their trap if they weren’t careful. Despite this, when their troupe came to halt in a narrow valley, Seb dared to climb up the slope and sneak a peek over the crest of the hill. He could just pick out the brownish speck of that caravan against the white of the Junei plain.
He was trying to gauge the manpower when Moto hissed a whisper at him.
“Seb! Get down!”
Seb spun around and there was Moto, staring daggers into him. Seb seethed like a lizard caught unawares, then reluctantly ducked back down into the shadow of the valley slope. Moto was the only one allowed to peek out over the hills and down into the spreading plain. He was the only one allowed because he’d said he was the only one allowed. Ayram had given him that authority and Seb couldn’t argue it. If Ayram were in charge he could maybe wheedle the privilege out of him, but there was no sense in pleading a case to Moto, so Seb slid back down the valley to take up the hiding place that he’d scouted earlier in the day
It was a decent valley, long, narrow, and steep-sided, and it bowed to the left, around a lumpy hill, which was good because the hill kept their hiding places out of sight until the last moment. Still, Seb would have preferred springing the ambush in the Junei Pass proper like they usually did. Moto insisted on doing it out in the hills on account of, ‘everyone expects to be ambushed inside the pass’. Moto insisted that the best thing to do was to mirror the caravan as they made their way across the plain, then meet them in the hills and attack while their eyes were set on the gap in the mountains.
Seb appreciated the logic of it—work against expectations, but at a certain point the best land for an ambush was the best land for an ambush, didn’t matter if they knew it was coming. People worried about ambushes in bottlenecks because bottlenecks were the best place to ambush. A valley like this was no true bottleneck. Compared to the vast expanse of the Junei plain, sure, it would do, but the slopes were nowhere near the height or steepness of a mountain shelf. The Hrks could scramble up them and maybe escape. It’d be like kicking off the top of an ant hill and all of a sudden it’s a free-for-all in all directions. They’d leave the wagons, but wagons weren’t what the Ayramun were after. And if those boys were Hrkan Skulsi, then the last thing he’d want is to do is share a slope with them.
All this was building up a frightful stress. It was even getting to Moto. The man was peering through his lenses, and his searching eye was so bugged out that he looked like he was seeing straight through the stomach of Solraheen. 
Seb was close enough to him to hear him whisper, “Shit.”
Young Papi, a scrawny, short, and excitable lad with a ratty face, was squatting nearby behind a stone. He heard Moto’s adumbration too, and he asked the man, “What is it?”
Moto said, “They’re changing routes.”
“What?” Papi squeaked.
“We need to move,” said Moto.
“They’re not coming through here?”
Moto ducked down from his hilltop sight spot and tucked his lenses back in their bag. He sat for a moment, elbows on knees, a perfect picture of contemplation, then said, “They were going to come through here, but now they’re not.”
“They changed directions?” Papi asked, eyes as wide as the moon.
Moto didn’t answer. He was back to brooding.
Papi said, “If they changed direction, then you think they know we’re here?”
“We need to move,” Moto repeated as he looked over his shoulder. “We need to hop over a few hills.”
Big Rork’s bald, blue-eyed, jug-eared head popped out from behind a boulder to share his opinion on the matter. “We can’t move now!” he said. “The Mazid will see us.”
“We can move if we’re careful,” Moto replied. He flicked his hand in the air as if Rork’s opinion were a fly. “The caravan is still a ways out.”
Rork’s upper lip curled. This wasn’t a natural facial tick, it was something he did because he thought that flashing his teeth made him look fierce. He said, sharply, “If you can see the Mazid, the Mazid can see you.”
Papi said, “We should wait for Elrahet’s smoke.”
The rest of the forty Ayramun were scattered about on either side of the narrow valley, and every one of them was staring up at three men. They couldn’t hear what was being said, but over the years they’d learned to read body language from afar. Moto was doing a decent job feigning calm, but Papi and Rork’s pained expressions told everyone everything they needed to know. 
Moto picked up his unstrung recurve bow and crawled back up the hilltop.
“Papi’s right,” Seb called after him. “We should wait for the fog to move.”
“Damn waiting for that witch!” Moto cried. “If her shits not here by now, it’s not coming. We need to move.”
“What about Ayram?” Papi asked.
“Yeah,” said Rork. “Where’s Ayram?”
“Let Ayram worry about Ayram.”
From across the valley, Skitter whistled to grab everyone’s attention. Once their gazes were in hand, she pointed up to the Hias mountains behind. There, drifting out of the dark belly of the Junei Pass, was a gray, wispy mist. It was hardly noticeable, but all the same it was there and it was pouring down into the hills, growing thicker by the moment. Elrahet’s magic was coming.
The snooty look in Moto’s eyes evaporated. He beckoned Seb up to him, and Seb scurried close. Moto whispered, “That damned fog is going to make it impossible to mirror that caravan. I’m going to get down to the plain to make sure I know exactly which path through the hills they’re taking. I’m putting you in charge until I get back.”
Seb nodded. Rork overheard and was less enthused. He left his boulder and squat-walked over. “You can’t do that,” he said. “Only Ayram can put someone in charge.”
“I don’t care who’s in charge,” Moto said scornfully. “Just don’t leave this valley. Don’t even think about it.”
There wasn’t anything in Moto’s words for Rork to argue with, though the wild look in his eyes and the veins spidering out of his shaven skull said he was trying to find it. Rork was a man who was always defending his place in the pecking order. The list of men who could give him short shrift was, itself, short—there was Ayram of course, and then barely Moto. No women. Moteah could probably take him if she wanted to try, but Rork would never admit it. He had a hard enough time admitting that he’d lose a brawl to Ayram. He’d have to be dead sober, and even then it’d be all, ‘you never know’, and ‘if things happened like so-and-so’, and ‘if I were proper mad I could kill anything’.
Rork’s hateful eye chased Moto as the man scuttled down the valley slope. At the bottom Moto dusted off his burnt orange robes and then did a glancing head count to make sure all the Ayramun were where they needed to be. He broke his own law of silence by saying out loud, “Alright, you idiots—sit tight, I’ll be back soon.” Then he turned around and disappeared around the valley bend. He was gone in less time than it took Seb to fish another borcandi spine out his sleeve.
Seb was chewing through his spines at a prodigious rate. Moto leaving only made the stress worse. It was never good for discipline when a leader leaves the group, even a much begrudged deputy leader like Moto. Without a man to lead Seb knew it was only a matter of time before someone got a bright idea that needed taming. Seb figured Rork would be the first to act up, because that’s just who he was. When Rork rambled back down to his boulder he was muttering insults and curses at no one in particular.
“Loosen up, Rork”, said Forty. Forty was an older woman with a rascal’s disposition. She playfully twanged her bow at Rork—a mocking shot at his self-importance. Rork sized up this affront with a puffed-out chest, and said, “Big show. Biiiiig show. But you better be careful, Shorty, ‘cause anything can happen in an ambush. With this mist rolling in, I might not know which way I’m shooting.”
“Same goes for me,” said Forty, tongue only half-in-cheek.
“Pipe down, Sol’s sake,” said Seb.
Forty gave Rork one final fleer, then the two marched apart and settled down to watch Elrahet’s mist bleed out of the mountains. 
The humidity had already reached them—Seb could smell the pleasant musk of moistened earth. And up in the mountains, the mist was no longer merely a mist, congealing as it was into ropes of fog, fog magic’d with purpose, spooling out into slender smoky tendrils that slithered down into the hills like snakes. Some of them twirled up into the darkening sky and there the wind caught them, lifted them higher, brushing out the finer threads. A low, rolling drum of distant thunder echoed out from somewhere deep inside the mountains.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” Papi said. Seb agreed. This was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of belly magic. It was, perhaps, too good. If he could see it, then no doubt a Mazid could see it too. What a Mazid would make of it, he could only guess, and just as it was all starting to coalesce into something resembling a natural, smooth fog, a misty fissure snapped into the sky over the mountain peaks, and from it a herd of storm clouds emerged. They crept out slowly, hesitantly, like cautious cattle out of the pen, but once they were out they began to billow as they fed on the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of Elrahet’s den.
Two fingers later and these storm clouds were blotting out the sun. Their gray shadows drooped down over the Ayramun’s valley, and not long after that the drifting fog mantled the nearest hill and fell upon them. Visibility dropped so low that Seb’s near-sightedness was no longer an impairment, for no one else could see further than he. They all watched the valley bend even though it was out of sight, for they all expected that at any moment, Moto would come jogging back to get them moving again.
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, little pricklings on the skin, a light peppering of the sandy rock and clay. This didn’t last long, for the raindrops swelled and in half-a-hand they were no longer prickling but plunking. 
“A bit much, isn’t it?” Papi said as he sheltered his bow with his short brown cape. “Don’t she know I can’t shoot no good in the rain?”
“It’ll stop soon,” Seb said.
But it didn’t.
The rain dribbled off the rocks and stony clay, and where there were depressions and scars in the earth the rain was pitter-pattering puddles into being. These puddles grew into boot-swelling pools that overflowed their banks, and streams poured down the valley slopes, following the run of furrows that ancient rains had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millennia. Seb figured it was more water in one short span than this stretch of desert had seen in twenty decades. It brought out the lizards—or rather pushed them out. A little gray bonbon popped out of the clay right next to Seb’s boot. Its swiveling eye looked mightily confused by the sudden downpour. It was so flustered that it didn’t have time to notice Seb’s heel coming down on it’s head. 
Seb looked over to young Papi. The boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers.
“Might as well be swimming,” he said. “Damn this goddamn rain!”
The curse was hardly out his lips when a gnarled flash of white lightning split through the iron mist above.

CRACK-BOOM!

A chorus of startled yelps echoed out from the Ayramun.
Papi looked like he’d shat himself. “Elrahet’s never conjured more than a mist!” he squealed.
Tizm, a gray-scruffed old-timer stationed across the valley grumbled out, “That old witch is gonna get us killed!”
“Where’s Moto?” came another ragged voice out of the rain.
“Screw that,” said another. “Where’s Ayram?”
From there the Ayramun began to bicker. The specific charges and insults being thrown across the valley weren’t anything new, but the stress and fear had so softened everyone up that the simplest ‘eat my shit’ cut deep. If it weren’t for the rain dampening their fighting spirit, there might have been a brawl.
Seb didn’t begrudge them their bellyaches. They’d been fed a raw meal. None of them were prepared for this kind of weather. The ground under his butt was getting slick and muddy, and if it rained any harder it would be difficult to shoot a bow because the wetter his bowstring got, the more it lost its spring. And there was no telling what a pounding rain would do to an arrow’s flight because Seb had never shot in such conditions. He knew enough to know that it wouldn’t help. For an ambush where everything had to go right, this was downright bad.
Seb began to brood and boil, but he caught himself in the act—he was torturing himself with expectations.
He needed to recenter himself.
Things weren’t bad. They weren’t good, either, but they weren’t bad.
This kind of thinking, this breaking the world into ‘good’ and ‘bad’, this was a symptom of expectations.
The truth was that everything was happening exactly as it was supposed to happen.
Seb closed his eyes and thumbed a short chain of prayer beads that he kept stashed in his robe, and as he did, he chanted a prayer to try and repress his simmering frustration.
	
	A well without water
		is filled with purpose,
	An arrow in the dirt
		has hit its mark,
	There is no mystery
		below the surface,
	There is no self
		above the Spark.

He repeated this five, ten times as he drew his shoulders in against the rain. This plunking rain. This purpose-driven rain. The fog, the bickering, these were purposeful too—to what end, Seb wasn’t sure, but now that he was looking for purpose he could sense a great deal of it, and perhaps it was brewing something terrible. The Ayramun were about to intersect with destiny—no—that was wrong to say, for destiny is ever-present. They were always intersecting with it. There were no bit-part players here. Poor and ragged as they may seem, these Ayramun were people, and all peoples are descendants of the first man and first woman, each soggy, grumpy face was the culmination of a hundred thousand generations of toil, as many generations as the Hrkan Lords themselves, and so each were as important, as godlike, for if but one of them was missing then events would not unfold as they were meant to. 
But he shouldn’t privilege the living. If the rock under his feet did not exist then he would not be sitting here, he would be sitting somewhere else, and thus the future, bounded by lines of immanence extending from the present, would wind a different weave. Yes, this very rock was sacred, as all things are sacred, as the dead lizard under his boot was sacred. All things are filled with the Spark’s sacred power.
“Seb! Quit your fartin’ about!”
“What!?”
The call had come from Rork. He and a few other miserable looking louts were down on the valley floor, straddling either side of a trickling stream that was building up in the middle of the valley’s run. Seb was about to chastise them for doing Sol-knows-what when he noticed that Moto had returned and was standing in their midst. Seb leapt to his feet and filtered down the valley slope with the rest of the Ayramun. 
Down in the valley’s belly, Moto face was alight with an excitement that no one shared.
“What’s wrong with you people?” he asked. “We’re about to bag us a Mazid and you look mad about it.”
Tizm, the old bent-backed wonder, kicked at the swelling stream and pointed to the sky and shouted, “The old witch has overcooked it!”
A refrain of agreement rained down. A few shushed, then others shushed back. Moto tried to calm them all with plaintive hands, saying, “People. Please.”
“Please my ass!” said Tizm. “This rain is gonna ruin everything!”
“The rain is perfect,” said Moto. “It’s got the Hrks hunkered down in a valley finger.”
“The Hrks?” asked Papi.
“Yes,” said Moto with a wary grin. “It’s Hrks we’re hunting. Hrkan Skulsi.”
The admission that it was Skulsi, not Blackwood caravan men, sent a wave of discontent rippling through the gathered Ayramun. Moto tried to stem the unease by lying. Seb knew it was a lie because when Moto was working through a big lie he’d smile and whine at the same damn time, like people’s doubting faces were annoying to him. “They’ve gone and lined themselves up against a wall for us,” he said. “Jumping them will be the easiest thing in the world, but we’ve got to hurry.”
Someone on the outer edge of the huddle blurted out, “What’s this about Hrks?”
Moto raised his voice above the rain. “The Minder and his Mazid didn’t come with a Blackwood caravan. They came with a Hrkan guard.”
Another round of shouting broke out, followed by another round of shushing and counter-shushing. Moto again tried to calm those gathered with nothing but his frantic hands. In the end he resorted to a sharp whistle, which shut everyone right up.
Moto said, “The fact that it’s Hrks doesn’t change a damned thing.”
Rork’s bald head stuck up above the huddle like a veiny, boiled egg floating in a stew. He spoke up and said, “All the better! I’d rather kill a Hrk than a Jandri man!” 
Moto nodded and said, “They’re bedded down like rabbits in a long, straight ravine.”
“The one with all the karkle bushes?” Seb asked.
“They’ve all got karkle bushes in them,” said Moto.
“The valley we’re standing in don’t.”
“It doesn’t matter,” said Moto. “All we have to do is sneak up and shoot some Hrks. It’ll be the easiest thing in the world. I know it’s raining hard, but I’m not asking you to feather an eye at ten-score yards. With this rain and fog we can get up close. You won’t miss. You can throw stones at them if you want to. You can stuff mud down their throats if you want to.”
“Where’s Ayram?” asked another.
 A quivering frustration flashed in Moto’s face and he shot a beseeching look to the heavens before saying, “This is happening whether Ayram’s here or not. Whether you like it or not. And it’s happening now, before this rain and fog let up. Let’s get moving!”
He turned and pushed his way past a few Ayramun and set off back towards the bend. After the briefest hesitation, Big Rork marched after him, and at his encouragement, everyone else followed. Together they were a small, sad herd of outland folk, a jumble of soggy wool and tired feet slapping the mud aside the building stream.
Seb kept to the back as they eventually climbed up and out of the valley and then crossed over a few others. They tramped through a flooding basin, and all the while Seb eyed the rainy mist with unease, for he could feel providence at work in that mist. Unlike the providence that people pray for and expect, this providence was providing something undesired, Seb was sure of that. Destructidence is what it was. Deathidence. There wasn’t an established word for it, which itself was a telling sign of the plundering spirit of the age. People only cared about their relationship to Solraheen’s plan so long as they were getting something good out of it. These Ayramun were no different.
Eventually Gugi found his way to Seb at the back of the wandering troupe. The skinny man’s face was agog with fear. He clearly wanted to talk, so Seb indulged him.
“Whaddya want?” Seb asked.
“Ya know where we headed, right?”
“I do.”
“It’s that cursed ravine, the one where I found those bones!”
“I know.”
“You should say somethin’ to the others.”
“Why not you?”
“I don’t ever say shit so no one’s gonna listen to me.”
“They won’t listen to me either.”
“They would. I would. That ravine is cursed, and people are gonna die if we get down in it.”
“I thought you said if we moved that body out of that ravine, then the curse would be moved out with it?”
“What do I know about curses? I was just sayin’ shit. For all I know that curse is what brought this storm and lured them Hrks down in it.”
Seb said, “Are you tryin’ to get out of payin’ me my spines?”
Gugi spat a wad of borcandi juice right where Seb was stepping, clearly upset that Seb could think about debts in a time like this. Before he could voice that concern, a muted horse’s whinny was heard through the splashing rain. Everyone instinctively crouched down and rushed to the shelter of a sloping mound. They were still a few-score yards away from the ravine where the Hrks were sheltering. Nothing of those troops could be seen through the mist.
Moto raced back down the line of Ayramun to crouch down next to Seb and Gugi. Voice low, he asked, “You two scouted this ravine, right?”
Gugi and Seb both nodded.
“Anything we should know about it?”
Gugi was quick to respond. “It’s cursed and we shouldn’t be here.”
“Cursed? What do you mean, cursed?”
Seb said, “This be the ravine where we found those bones.”
Moto snorted, almost laughed, then said, “I need to know the lay of the land. I can’t see through this damned mist so I don’t know if there’s an easy out for them up on the eastern side.”
“Moto,” said Gugi, leaning into his words, “I’m tellin’ you, this place is cursed. It’s gonna get us killed.”
“So what? If it’s cursed for us, it’s cursed for them too. Doubly so for them, cause they’re sitting in it.”
“Yeah, but we the ones who found the bones! We the ones that been warned! Not them. Us! Me!”
Moto gave up on Gugi and turned to Seb. “Is there any way in and out of that long stretch that might make it easy for them?”
Seb shook his head. “That stretch is mostly steep. There is one little nook on the other side that’s kinda like a stair but that’s it.” 
“How wide?”
“Not that wide.”
Moto paused to think, then said, “I want you two to go back a ways, and cross to the other side of the ravine where it’s safe. Then work your way back down the other side and then set up where that stair is.”
“Just us two?” Gugi asked.
Moto turned and motioned towards his sister, Moteah, who was not at all enthused to be at her brother’s beck and call. Like Moto, she carried herself with an air of authority, though she was even more arrogant about it than her upfront brother.
Moto looked her square in the eyes, “Get Rork and twelve others to follow Seb and Gugi. You’re going to set up on the other side of the ravine, and we’re going to try and push the Hrks towards you. So be quick and be ready. There won’t be a whistle. When they come, they come.” 
Moteah snuck away, gathered up Rork and the nearest twelve Ayramun, then brought them to Seb and Gugi. Gugi wasn’t about to take charge, so Seb crowned himself and led them all back towards the mountains, keeping the course of the cursed ravine a small-score yards away to his right. When he felt they’d gone far enough, he led them sliding down into the steep ravine, and then they had a tough, nervy scramble back up the other side. Once up they headed back towards the plain, keeping low and quiet.
Seb knew the place he was looking for, but with the rain and mist there was no way he’d find the spot until he was already upon it. The fog was so thick that he kept second guessing whether he was even following the right ravine. Nonetheless he kept going, one foot in front of the other, trying not to think too much about the fight that was only fingers away. Soon, he was confronted with the sound of snorting wagon ponies drinking their fill of rainwater.
He crouched down, and the rest Ayramun behind did likewise. He ambled over to the edge of the ravine and slithered up against a big, solid boulder that leaned over the ravine’s lip. From there he could hear horse hooves stamping in the ravine’s stream. If a horse was that close, then a Hrk might be closer. He didn’t want to peek over the boulder to get the lay of the scene, but when he heard the clank of wood on wood he couldn’t help himself. He steeled his nerves and peered over the boulder.
Right below him were two horses still hitched to an tarp-covered wagon, and behind them were two more horses and another covered wagon, and whatever was behind them was lost to the mist. There was only one man. He was a natural Hrk, so far as Seb could tell, a natural Hrk with redblack hair and a full black beard that made his head seem massive. Clad in sopping wet browns, he was darting to and fro amongst the wagons, prepping them against the rain with all the urgency of a man who knew the curse that water puts on a wagon that’s been drawing dry. He was driving himself insane as he scampered through the rain and fumbled with the wheel tents that were ready-tied to the sides of the wagon bed. He snapped one down and slapped the sideboards twice with an open hand, and this loosed a latch which pinned the tailgate, and when that swung open, a dead body dropped rolled out of the bed and plopped down into the mud.
It was a dead Jandri boy in a white tunic.
Seb turned to his troupe behind him. The confusion on his face must have been easy to read because Rork grumbled and invited himself up to Seb’s rock. The man kept his vein-strapped head tucked against the rock’s hump as he peered out around it.
Upon seeing the wagons and the lonesome wagonmaster, and the dead body, Rork’s confusion surpassed Seb’s. His bulging eyes searched for some sign of the rest of the enemy, but found none.
“Shit.”
Moteah joined the two men at the boulder and quietly stole a look for herself. Her usually uptight expression didn’t show the slightest hint of concern.
“What do they got a corpsecart for?” Rork asked her in a whisper.
“Why would I know?” Moteah said.
“Your brother’s the one who went scouting.”
“Do I look like Moto to you?”
“Yeah, you do,” said Rork. “If he sprouted tits I couldn’t tell you two apart.”
Moteah’s brow tightened even further. It wasn’t anger. She called it ‘severe disinterest’. It was one of her two expressions, the other being plain old disinterest. Problem was, that look wasn’t a good way to deal with a man like Rork. The best thing to do was to pretend not to notice him, even ignore him altogether. Unfortunately for Moteah, she was too good looking to get away with that either. To a man like Rork, her wrinkled brow was nothing but shirred meat, and he rest of her nothing but meat wrapped up in a woman’s robe.
“Bitch is leadin’ us into a trap,” he whispered to the others.
“I’m not leading anyone anywhere. Seb is.”
Seb felt the eyes of both these schemers bear down upon him. 
“Don’t lookit me,” he whispered back. “I didn’t set this up.”
They were still looking at him.
Seb pointed east, in the direction of the Junei Plain, and whispered, “There’s a overhang in the ravine down a ways. It could do as a cave. It could be that the Hrks have taken it up.” 
“Seb, you’re a soilbucket.” Rork’s voice was uncomfortably loud. “This is a goddamned trap if I ever seen one. I bet my three uglies they know we’re here.” 
Rork turned to the iron mist from whence they’d came, and he cast his suspicious eye about, as if the dark boulders lurking in the haze were really Hrkan Skulsi in disguise. He unwrapped his bow from its cow-leather strap and strung it with an easy flick. The rest of the Ayramun caught on to his excitement, and they strung their bows in kind. Then all thirteen of them, Gugi included, crept up to join Seb, Moteah, and Rork at the lip of the ravine. When their fists were full of arrows, Rork decided that the time was right to strike. He gave his bow a pull to test the string, and then he stood up and loosed an arrow at the unaware Hrkan wagonmaster.
The arrow didn’t have far to go. Almost as soon as the fletching was free from Rork’s fingers the arrowhead was planting itself into the back of that Hrkan neck. The man clutched and gurgled, then fell to his knees and splashed down face-first into the budding rainwater stream. His head was buried full in the running water, and downstream one of the horses whinnied and stamped when it found its drink suddenly awash with blood.
Rork ducked back behind the boulder and gave Seb a contented grin, like he’d just won the battle all by himself. Then they waited. Moto had said there wouldn’t be a whistle, so they had to wait for the battle straight. It was unbearable. They waited for at least a full finger, and by then the rain started to let up and the sound of the ravine’s running water was louder than the plunks which poured from the sky.
Rork made to climb down into the ravine.
Seb caught the hem of his robe and pulled him back.
“What are you doing?” Seb rasped.
“There’s no one here,” Rork sneered.
“Moto said we should wait!”
Rork stretched his arms out to gesture at all the nothingness down in the ravine. He said, “Wait for what?”
“A signal.”
“Signal to do what? What are we ambushing, horses?”
One of the Ayramun, a young one named Ritt, popped his head up and said, “There’s Hrks down there somewhere, I feel it.”
“Quiet down!” Moteah snipped.
Much to Moteah’s dismay, and Seb’s amazement, Rork stood straight up and put his finger and his thumb to his lips and whistled out a three-chirp alarm—bright and sharp. The sound cut through the falling sheet of misty rain as easily as if it weren’t there at all. The horse’s ears swiveled as they regarded Rork with some confusion.
Before anyone could do anything, Rork scrambled down to the bottom of the ravine, arrow knocked, and waited for something to happen. When nothing did, he growled a curse and shot an arrow into the back of the already dead Hrk. 
“I’m not stayin’ here no longer,” he said.
With that, Rork marched across the ravine and tossed his bow up onto the other side and started to climb out.
Moteah swept up in Seb’s periphery and shot an arrow right at him.
In clean dry air a gull-feather arrow with a whistling nock would trill with excitement when released, but soggy as it was, Moteah’s arrow flew across the ravine with nary a whine. Rork had no idea what hit him, and it hit him in the back, right inside the left shoulder blade and continued on through the heart. He fell backwards, back into the ravine, and he was limp dead before he hit the ground.
Seb gasped. It was against the rules to even scratch one of their own, even a throbbing cock like Rork. Killing an Ayramun was a privilege reserved for Ayram.
Before Seb could get out a word, Moteah grabbed him by the breast of his robe and yanked him down behind the boulder. He twisted her hand off him and held it firm in his wiry grip.
“What’d ya kill him for!?”
Moteah put her finger to her lips and shushed him. Seb grimaced then spat the whole borcandi blob that had been stewing in his cheek. He spat it right at Moteah’s face, but quick as a cat, Moteah ducked out of its terrifying arc and the wad landed with a splat on Gugi’s chest. Gugi squealed in disgust as he flicked the gooey gunk away. Moteah clapped his mouth shut with her free hand and her eyes flared caution at both men. She pointed with her chin to the opposite bank and mouthed a silent warning—Hrks.
Seb let go of her wrist and peered around the boulder. There across the ravine were two shawled figures wandering out of the mist. At first he took them for Ayramun, but the first of them made a foreign gesture towards the other, and when Seb saw a flash of white under one of their ruddy cloaks he knew for sure—these were Hrkan men.
The two figures paused, cocked their heads towards Seb like they’d felt his thoughts ripple the fog between them, and they dropped down flat against the ground.
Seb ducked fast behind his boulder. He turned to Moteah and had to restrain himself from shouting. 
“They know!” he whispered.
The sound was hardly out his mouth when from behind them, on their own cozy side of the ravine, a Hrkan horn of war thrilled the air.
BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommmm
Hrkan battle horns are deep and drooping bleats that tremble the bones of even the most well armored lizards, and Seb was clad in nothing but rags. When the horn blast jumped up behind him it startled him out of his skin. He yelped and swore and swiveled around to face the terror, and there, deep in the fog, running right towards him, was a blurry host of men, Hrkan Skulsi, white coats flashing bright under their brown disguises. Maybe twenty or more of them.
They moved in silence, a leggy, white speckled blob, all business, just jogging right up like they were lost and about to ask for the way to the road. They didn’t try to intimidate with screams and yells, for in truth they were killers, not soldiers. The power of the Mazidai had long made armies obsolete, so the kind of professional fighting man that the Hrkan world breeds is one who lusts for the frenzy of small skirmishes where the pain of death is anesthetized in glory, and man proves himself against man.
The horn bleated again.
BWEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooommmm
The Skulsi blob began to sprint. 
Seb felt a strange warmth running down his thigh and he realized that he’d pissed himself. Moteah loosed an arrow at the running blob and before she saw the results, she took off sprinting west, back up along the ravine and towards the mountains. Seb took off after her, and the rest of the Ayramun followed. They trimmed the ravine, pursued by that mob of Hrks, while on the opposite bank those two Hkran cloaks had somehow multiplied into twenty. They shadowed the Ayramun, silent like the others, and they bunched up against the ravine as they waited for the terrain to present an opportunity to close the gap and kill. Seb nocked an arrow midstride and shot it across, but it flew harmlessly into the mist. Others had more luck—Gugi put an arrow through the leading man’s leg, and the man behind him was struck down when an arrow rammed into the side of his skull. The two figures crumpled to the ground and those behind bumbled over them, but this did little to allay the chase. 
Then Moteah jumped down into the ravine.
Seb wondered what insanity could have possessed her to give those Hrkan Skulsi a leaping chance, when in the next instant, a thin, golden beam of Mazidfire came ripping right by his ear.
The line of this blazing beam shot out in the misty distance. Seb ducked low and avoided its swipe, but the men behind him weren’t so lucky. The fire ran right through the back of Gugi’s head and burst out of his eye-socket as if his brains and bone weren’t there. As his body slumped down, the stripe of fire burned a slit into his skull, and then the fireline’s distant fulcrum swiveled and the beam of death swiped a downwards arc through the air, cutting four Ayramun into uneven halves as the fire smashed into the earth, sizzling the soggy clay as it went.
As suddenly as it came, the Mazidfire was gone. Somewhere in the misty distance, the unseen Mazid had closed its mouth, and what was left of that golden beam ran roaring into earth, leaving in its wake charred flesh, black glass, glowing stone, and smoke.
All those still alive threw themselves down the ravine’s steep slope. Seb bumped into a karkle bush on the way down and rolled uncontrolled to the bottom where he flopped belly-first onto the muddy ground and slid with a splash into the ravine’s nascent stream. The rest of the Ayramun were already scrambling to their feet and fleeing along after Moteah. Seb stayed put, for there in front of his eyes was the very bush he’d seen that morning, the bush from under which he’d pulled those accursed bones. Its black twigs bloomed above him like a monument to fate. His mind was unpinned by the significance of it, and he felt that awesome humbling chill which only comes when one catches a glimpse of the divine plan.
He tried to reel himself back in by telling himself this bush was just a bush—no more or less a major player in the divine plan as the mud squishing against his stomach, or even Ayram himself. Yes, this bush was just a bush.
And yet…
And yet he was supposed to crawl up under that bush and so he did. He crawled up under it, and he lay himself down, right down where those bones had been, and he watched through the brambles as the Hrks descended upon his straggling companions.
Ten of the leaping Hrks were shot down by arrows before their feet landed in the ravine, leading to a lopsided melee in favor of the Ayramun. Yet the Skulsi, undaunted, charged on. Their feet flung mud as their powerful strides closed the distance as fast as drag-backed lizards. Seb cowered under the bush lest the obligations of battle came to him. His gut turned at the sight of one man sticking his boot on the back of another’s head, suffocating him in the mud. This cruelty was paid in turn with a knife stuck through his gut. 
By then, the Hrks that ran along ravine’s right lip caught up, but they did not join the fray. The continued on to chase what quarry had escaped.
The battle below them raged.
Swords and knives clanged and sparked. Mud-caked fists buried themselves into eye sockets and sharp elbows cracked against ribs. Deeds were done which which warranted songs, for the bravery and fight, in both Hrk and Ayramun alike, was tremendous. In the end, all that was left was a smattering of corpses and two mud-grumbled men, both wounded and breathing hard with blades held out before them. Neither made a move as both were content to catch their breath.
The rain had stopped. The ravines stream was trickling. Seb felt the itch of purpose stirring in his stomach. Perhaps the bush had reserved him for this very moment, for here was an opportunity for decisive action, and that was all anyone could ever ask for, clarity of cause and effect—the outcome of a skirmish turned with him. Seb twisted out from under his bush to fire an arrow at the man he took to be a Hrk, but just as he did, two figures stepped up to the lip of the ravine above him. The shorter one opened its mouth and a golden beam of Mazidfire burst out. It cut both combatants in two.
Seb froze in fear at the sight of the Mazid and its Minder. He hustled back under the bush.
He had never seen a Mazid before, and he couldn’t see much of it now. It was shorter than its Minder by a good foot, the height of youth, and it was skinny, and its misshapen frame was wrapped up in black robes and a black cowl like a penitent priest. Seb couldn’t see the eyes, only the general gauntness of its face, which was white as sea foam, like the creature had been dipped in cream. Its chin was smooth and hairless as an egg, and its brows were shaven. The Minder was a normal Jandri man, dressed in the standard scribal robes—rich blue with a blue hooded cape that mantled his broad shoulders like a pelt.
Another man joined the two figures up on that bank. Unlike the others, he was a natural born Hrk through and through—blackred hair, greying around the temples, with copper skin and eyebrows so thick they could flog lizardskin. His dark cloak was held together by a silver sunrose brooch—the mark of military command. This man marched up to the much shorter Mazid bearing a look of such contempt that it seemed to Seb that he was about strike the creature, but he merely pointed to the dead men down in the ravine and shouted, “Explain yourself!”
The Mazid said meekly, “I don’t know what you mean.”
“You killed one of my men!”
“I didn’t know which was which.”
“So you killed both?!” The commander turned to the Mazid’s Minder and said, “I don’t know how you people breed these things, but something’s wrong. Each one is dumber than the last.”
The Minder said, “You preach to the choir, captain. You’ve only had to deal with it for a week, whereas I am bonded to it.”
He pulled his handless left arm out of his robes as if to prove the fact.
“Well get a better grip on it!” the captain shouted.
“I’ve tried. But the Lords are married to their methods. They say they’re balancing intelligence with docility, but then they bind me to this Mazid, which is neither intelligent nor amenable to instruction, and when I complain they tell me to bear it like a man, and move on. So bear it, captain—those are not my words, but theirs.”
The Skulsi captain looked like he was about to strangle them both.
The Mazid, caught like a child between quarreling parents, bowed its head respectfully and said, “I’m sorry.”
The Minder tsked his annoyance. “What use does the captain have for an apology? Tell me, what can he do with it?”
“He can—”
“That was a rhetorical question.”
In the Minder’s good hand was a short rod of wood wrapped in braided leather. He held it up to the captain and said, “You may hit it if you like. It won’t hurt the creature. It doesn’t feel pain, but I find it works out my frustrations nonetheless.”
The Captain took the rod firm in hand.
“Avoid the head and neck,” said the Minder.
The captain swung the rod and brought it down hard on the Mazid’s shoulder socket. The whole arm sunk down and went limp, clearly dislocated, and it looked brutal, but Seb winced more than the Mazid did.
The Captain stepped back to appreciate the bludgeoning, then said, “They don’t make Mazidai like they used to.”
“They don’t.”
“It’s a wonder the Lords make use of these things at all,” said the captain. “They’ve long outlived their usefulness. We Skulsi can handle these outlaws on our own.”
The scribal Minder was miffed by this remark. “Captain,” he said, “the only reason you are dealing with outlaws at all is because the outland tribes are too whipped by the Mazidai to become anything more than outlaws. Get rid of me and my kind, and you might find yourself on the front line of a real battle.”
“What do you mean, a real battle?”
“I meant no disrespect.”
“It sounded like disrespect.”
“I assure you, I meant no disrespect.”
The captain glared at the Minder, then said, “We don’t have time for this. We’ve work to do.”
“No,” said the Minder as he drew his lips tight. “I won’t have a captain of the Skulsi brewing discontent behind my back. If you’ve something foul towards me brewing in your stomach, then let’s have out with it.”
The old captain glowered and said, “Remember that you are here to make things easier for me, not the other way around. And I’d say that killing my men outright is a violation of that mission. Worthy of censure! If you were not a Minder I would have had you burned out for incompetency.”
The Minder was unimpressed. “Yes, if I were not a Minder you could do all manner of things. But fantasies are the domain of children and beggars, not soldiers who stand up straight. White light, we speak of the decline of the Mazidai, but if you are Hrkan Skulsi then I worry doubly for the Lordship.”
“You have a problem with me?”
“Look at you—pomped up like you deserve something better than what you’ve gotten, like you don’t understand that I can speak to you how I want. Worry about yourself, captain, lest that self-important stomach growl too loudly forget the station of its Spark.”
“You’d threaten a captain of the Skulsi!?”
“I would. You should be stricter with your moods, given how easily I could end you.”
The captain smirked, put his hands on his hips, and eyed the Minder with amusement. He said, “I doubt you have the control. Just the other day one of my men saw your Mazid let an outland poke run free. It could have easily burned the man down, but it didn’t.”
The Minder looked upon his Mazid with some confusion and asked it, “Is that true?”
“Yes,” said the Mazid meekly. “The man posed no imminent threat.”
“Did I tell you to spare our quarry if it posed no imminent threat?”
“No.”
“Did I give any order that could be construed as a grant of mercy to any of these outland pokes?”
“No.”
“Then tell me, why did you not burn him down?”
The Mazid gave no answer.
“That was not a rhetorical question,” the Minder said.
“I guess…I’m not sure”
“You’re not sure!?” the Minder exclaimed, as if the utterance was not possible.
“Hah!” laughed the captain. “You see? You’ve barely got a hold of that thing.”
“Oh, shut up.”
“Wait until Lord Gagan hears about this. He’ll have you out in the pastures where you belong, minding sheep not Mazidai.”
The Minder countenanced the captain’s threat with a grim nod. Seb could feel the captain’s smugness even from underneath his karkle bush. 
Then the Minder said to the Mazid, “Obo, kill that man.”
The Mazid’s throat glowed gold. Soon its mouth was alight with the fire of gods and a thin beam of light shot out. A heartbeat later, and the captain crumpled to the ground. In the place where his forehead used to be was a black and smoldering hole. What was left of his face was fixed in hurtled surprise.
The Minder grunted in satisfaction, looked down on his Mazid with contempt and said, “Don’t you ever think about what you want or don’t want. You don’t have wants. Get creative with my orders again and I’ll have us both sent back to the guild for—”
His words were interrupted by the sight of the Mazid shuffling towards the ravine’s lip. Despite its apparent frailty, its movements were deliberate and precise. It then began to climb down into the ravine, leaving its Minder in a state of shock.
“What are you doing?” the Minder spat, but the Mazid did not answer. It had reached the ravine’s belly and was walking towards Seb’s bush. It was close enough now that Seb could see its gaunt visage clearly—a ghoul of a person, with gray, empty, Sparkless eyes.
“Stop!” the Minder commanded with a shout. His word shook the Mazid’s spine. The Mazid paused, struggled a step, then continued on as if laden with chains.
The Minder stretched out his handless arm, his stubby wrist wrapped in white cotton, and he pointed it at the Mazid and yanked it back, screaming, “STOP!”
The shout was so strong it had form and purpose, for it punched the simpering rain, exploding the droplets out to drape a bubble of dry air which enveloped himself, the Mazid, and Seb. The command wrenched Seb’s own Spark in his stomach at the sound of it. It struck the Mazid with force, as every single muscle in its body snapped taut, and the sad creature titled, limbs-bent, frozen and unbalanced, and when the bubble of rain collapsed down on it, it fell over, stiff as stone. The slight creature splashed onto the muddy ground with all the jarring heft of a tossed blanket.
Its unsettling gray eyes remained unnervingly alert. They swiveled in their sockets and found Seb inside his bush, and Seb lay transfixed. In Seb’s long journeys through the Sand he had looked every manner of creature in the eye, and in each of them he’d found some sort of kinship—not so when he beheld the pale, bald, browless, lashless, grey-eyed Mazid.
His fixation on this creature was broken when the Minder stomped down into the belly of the ravine. This short climb put the man out of breath, and he stood still for a moment before giving the Mazid a probing kick. The Mazid was still as stiff as a board. The Minder cursed his own luck, then picked the stiff creature up, put it upon on his shoulder, and began to walk away. He was almost lost the mist when Seb slithered out of his bush and drew his knife.
 Seb crept along, making extra sure he didn’t slop too loudly in the muck as he closed the distance to the Minder’s misty figure. Stalking a man with his back turned triggered Seb’s instinct for the hunt. He matched the Minder’s footfalls and kept himself ready to leap should the breeze carry his sound or scent towards his prey. Excitement swelled when his quarry strolled past the bodies of Rork and the Hrkan wagonmaster, for there, too, were the noisemaking horses still hitched to their wagons, each beast oblivious to Seb’s murderous pursuit. The first horse eyed him without so much as a. Seb picked up his pace, and soon he was only yards away from the Minder, and when Seb could no longer contain himself, he screamed such a deep and wild scream that it surprised even himself.
The Minder dropped his burden in fright. Seb plunged his knife into the man’s flinching shoulder. The blade blurred against the backswinged arc of blood and Seb’s arm swung through flurry of blows. The Minder twisted and fell and into the sticky mud. He tried to scramble free, tried to shove aside the onslaught, but the man had only had the one good hand. He raised his stumped forearm to shield his face, but Seb’s knife was there, and it was there again in the ribs, and there in the stomach, and in the neck, then ripping through the muscle in his flailing arm. Seb jabbed at the man’s throat, and jabbed again, and again, and he did not let up until his knife slipped out of his hand from the glut of blood.
A few gratuitous punches later, and the Minder was dead.
Seb sat back on the dead man’s waist and admired the kill. It wasn’t clean, but the struggle had been quick, one-sided, and glorious. Seb admired his ultimate prize, the pale Mazid, who lay limp in the mud behind. Its eyes were stilled and its body dead, as it was no longer bound to any will. The sight of it settled Seb into the realization that he’d succeeded where all the other Ayramun had failed, and an exultant cheer welled up in his stomach. He made to scream his victory to dead gods above, but his shout was chilled by the sight of a short, irascible pillar of black rags standing only a few yard away—the old witch Elrahet.
Some unseemly witchness had swept her down from her mountain cave, and there she stood in the mist, just behind the Hrkan wagon. Her dark eyes quested the muddy ground, and her gnarled cane prodded at the body which had fallen out of the wagon bed. It was as if she hadn’t even noticed Seb’s great triumph
Seb quickly gathered himself up, and the limp Mazid as well, and he hustled over to the witch to show off his prize. He held the Mazid out to her as an offering, expecting praise, but Elrahet merely glanced and nodded. She was focused instead on the some hidden purpose in the dead body at her feet—it was a skinny Jandri youth clad in nothing but a white linen tunic. Sensing Seb’s chagrin, she nodded towards the Hrkan wagon which was packed to the boards with more dead Jandri youths. They’d been crammed inside the bed like poached pigs, and Elrahet knocked one of their dangling arms with her cane and said, in her sneering way, “The Amalgamete has outgrown its suckling chin.”
The sight of so many bodies unsettled Seb’s stomach, even though he’d just got done gutting a man’s throat.
“They’re not dead,” Elrahet said scornfully. “Their Sparks are still bound to the flesh. Look.” The dead boy at her feet was half-slipped from his white tunic, revealing his legs and uglies. She poked him in the stomach with her cane to drag the tunic further up, revealing a ring of raspberry darkness welling up under the skin and circling wide around the bellybutton.
“He was meant to be food,” she said.
“Food?” Seb asked.
“Food for the Amalgamete. The beast is ready to eat. We’ve not caught our Mazid a moment too soon.”</Text>

            <Text>His servant, Salavan, was quick to clarify, “Please do not struggle. Stressed meat tastes foul.”
Then, with the natural grace of a man made king from birth, the Amalgamete twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, and waved his minions onward.
Both Moto and Moteah threw down their packs and shielded Elrahet behind them. Mandri held out his sword and assumed responsibility for watching their backs. He turned once more towards the exit. He suddenly regretted not paying more attention to Moto’s fighting lessons, though they might not have helped to prepare against five eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetles from Shis arrayed above that square doorway. He would have to fight off all of them all at once.
“What do I do!?” he screamed at siblings.
“Just stab the damned things!” Moteah cried.
Mandri shrugged off his pack and let Obo fall heedlessly to the floor. The beetles fluttered their shells against their backs, preparing to jump. Mandri readied himself to stab. Then the world flashed with the white light of purpose. The God’s Eye sight had blinded him.
“Not now!” he screamed as his vision plunged into a swirling sea of iridescent light. He ducked low to the ground and swung his sword wildly in the air. He prayed for Solraheen’s protection—he spoke no words, it was a stronger prayer than that, it was a burst of raw emotion. When the white light bled away it revealed a world in which the hag-beetles had yet to jump. Mandri could see their Sparks floating inside their shells, Sparks of saturated yellow. Shimmering white threads of purpose stretched out of them and wound through the net of fate which fixed the world—four beetle threads ran up to the ceiling. One arced through the air straight at Mandri.
He would have taken it for his doom, but it stopped right in front of his nose. And there was another shimmering thread of purpose arcing there, one which wound out through the doorway and disappeared into the darkness of the throne room. 
The hag-beetle jumped. It sped through the air and its shell parted to let loose its spike, but Mandri did not duck, for he’d caught sight of a giant running through the doorway—a wild eyed giant with a bread-loaf beard. Mandri sighed in awe as Ayram swung his iron spear right through its guiding thread to break the hag-beetle’s back. An eye-blink later and beetle smashed into the ground with a tremendous crunch.
There stood Ayram. His Spark shone brightly because of course it did, this was Ayram, glorious Ayram, the conquering hero. He even had the Mazidariga child underneath his arm. When he yanked his spear out of the beetle’s belly, the beetle spasmed, its Spark dimmed, and its eight legs and many fingers twitched feebly a moment more.
The four other hag-beetles, seeing this, scurried up to the ceiling and fled back down the hall, following their threads of purpose back towards the Amalgamete.</Text>

            <Title>Mandri's Demon</Title>
            <Text>The next morning, when Mandri was sure no one would notice, he stole himself away, ducked behind a bush, used a thorn to poke a hole in the tip of his God’s Eye burgeon. He dabbed one meager droplet of its juice onto his tongue—no more than that. The idea was to escape himself and liven up the day’s journey, not end up catatonic like before. And as the sun had just bobbed up above the horizon, the drug’s dissociative effects would kick in right around mid-morning, right when the heat would start to get under his robe.
He plugged the tiny hole he’d made in the burgeon with a tiny thorn from the bush, and he stuffed the blessed fruit into his robe to save for later. If he rationed it carefully he could make the juice last for a week. He would roll the rest of the burgeon flat and dry it out, and from there he’d experiment to discover the best method of ingestion. Then, maybe, he could steal another.
He rejoined the march through the vast expanse of emptiness. He avoided idle conversation, for he was intent on documenting the peculiarities of God’s Eye sight as it came. Thankfully, the world around him possessed no black splotches to fall into, nothing like that sooted ceiling in Seb’s cave. The darkest colors were the purplish shadows cast by scattered sandstone rocks, but as the sun continued to rise, these shadows shifted blue to match the richness of the sky.
A whole hand passed and nothing happened.
Mandri wondered if he needed to double the dose, but he was scared to do it. It wouldn’t end well for him if he took too much and collapsed into the Sand. 
Seb would search his robes.
She’d find the burgeon.
That wasn’t the plan, so he soldiered on.
Mandri licked his lips because his mouth was dry. Burgeons have a way of doing that, but so does the sun. The ground in this part of the desert was a few shades nearer to white, so it reflected the sun a few shades nearer to unbearable. He could feel his face hardening into that squint that every outland poke wore the world over. It hurt to look in any direction but up.
This limitation added some difficulty to his quest of cataloging the effects of the burgeon. He didn’t suspect that a good measure of this blinding brightness was due to the burgeon itself, and he only realized it when the whole world flashed white.
He blinked in shock, and this only triggered another flash as a purer, shimmering divine light flooded his sight from the periphery inward.
He gasped and shut his eyes tight, but closed, his vision boiled with that light, a whiteness which churned and split into an iridescent swirl.
When he opened his eyes again the world was not the same.
What he saw was a desert bright and glistening. It was like burgeonsight but grander, for more than a mere glisten, he saw a web of iridescent threads winding around the world and joining to the fibrous threads which tufted up from the skin of every surface. Rainbow filaments carpeted the sand like grass, covered the rocks, covered the entire world off to the infinite distance. Everything bristled with these flighty fibers, and somehow Mandri knew what they were—divine lines of unveiled purpose, connecting cause and effect. These were lines which traced the future of all living and non-living things.
Ayram and Moto walked in front, and Mandri could see their Sparks shimmering inside their stomachs, and the space between their swinging arms was webbed with iridescent threads. They moved apart, and the threads connecting their robes stretched and split, then reached and rejoined, and through it all, the two men’s Sparks stayed linked by a thicker, brighter string, and each had other thicker strings stretching out into the world.
Two of these numinous lines were connected to Mandri, for down inside his own stomach was a white-hot knot of shimmering light whose edges glittered red, green, and blue. He moved to touch it, and as his fingers approached, translucent hairs connecting them to his Spark shimmered into being, as if they’d always been there, for this moment was the fulfillment of purpose.
His fingers stopped at his skin. This came as a surprise, for he expected to be able to sink his fingers inside to brush his Spark.
He swung his foot up over the ground in front of him, and threads seemed to spring up from the sand, as if alive, and they latched onto the sole of his shoe.
“Incredible.”
He looked behind and saw that his Spark was connected to Moteah’s, and hers and his were connected to Elrahet’s, and everyone’s was connected to everyone else’s, each as bright as every other, save for Elrahet’s, whose Spark outshone them all. Indeed, her Spark nearly outshone the sun which rose into the sky behind her.
More than anyone else Elrahet was enmeshed in a beautiful, complex web of purpose, and these fibers, every one, were hereby joined in Mandrameen’s eye, for his sight was the spindle that bound them together into a yarn which wound around his mind and back out through his iris and into the world, a wire spun tight and then unraveled, a continuous threading and rethreading of purpose.
Mandri lamented the lack of materials, for he was struck by an overwhelming urge to record the moment. If he’d only had a stick of charcoal and a sheet of paper he could start sketching right then and there, and if he didn’t sketch it out now as he saw it, details would be forgotten. After one night’s sleep they’d be lost forever, and that was terrifying, for the moment was pleading with him to be given its own sacred body—an image in a frame—so that it might move about the world and inject the moment’s purpose into every future moment.
But how could he capture this light by scribbling with ash? Or even colored paint? Reality conspired against him. It was hopeless to even try.
“Keep walking,” Elrahet grumbled as she passed him. The wind flicked the hem of her desert-bitten robe, stretching and snapping filaments of purpose.
Then he noticed one thin, shimmering strand of purpose extend from out of Elarhet’s Spark and shoot straight up into the sky. He followed its path and saw it touch a vulture which wheeled overhead. Elrahet had more threads connecting to her than there were living things around them. She was a locus for this web of purpose. Some threads dug into the sand, to lizards or snakes or fleas. Some spread out into the horizon to peoples and creatures unknown. One thread was of particular interest, for it ended in a rock some fifty yards away—a natural, red, sway-backed block of sandstone. The sand was littered with similar slumpy boulders, but only one drew a thread of purpose into its core, and it was a bright thread, a Sparked thread, as bright as any connecting to the Ayramun.
Mandri walked towards it to investigate.
That’s when he noticed that sound vibrated these threads. The faint scream of the vulture above, the sparkling sizzle of sand sweeping, the thupping of leather-bound feet sprinting along the sand. The sound of Moteah’s voice yelling.
Yelling what?
“Are you blind!?”
A hand grabbed his shoulder and yanked him back, and he fell on his ass. 
Moteah didn’t give Mandri time to complain about the interruption, for she grabbed onto Obo’s litter and began pulling them both away from that curious rock. This action made Mandri realize that he hadn’t yet seen what Obo looked like, and he desperately wanted to know how Obo’s pseudospark fit into this vision.
“Let go!” he shouted, but Moteah only stopped when she was satisfied. When she did let go she stumbled back and screamed, “Are you insane!?”
By now the others had doubled back and joined the girl. Mandri couldn’t see their faces, for all they all were snared in silken cocoons of purpose.
“I told you he’s got a dim Spark,” said Moto.
Mandri, realizing he should say or do something normal to hide his jumped-upness, blurted out, “What’s going on?”
Moteah picked up a loose pebble, then side-armed it at the boulder that Mandri had been hunting.
The pebble smacked into the boulder’s side.
The boulder flinched and hissed as it flashed its yellow fangs.
A demon!
It was a red demon with flat, rock-patterned scales that melted into each other as it settled back into its hunched back squat. The creature blended in so neatly with all the sandstone boulders scattered about, that Mandri’s addled mind hadn’t seen it for what it was.
He squinted in an attempt to discern its features. He noticed the organic line of corded muscle roping around its shoulders, and these were human shoulders which sprouted human arms, or rather, human-ish, for the creature was the size of a dog, and its hands were curled and clawed like those of a long-lived pillow lizard, those favored pets of outland kings. Its face was a mixture of the grotesque. It had the scrunched-up snout of a flat-faced pig, the nose and drooling flews of a hunting hound, and ugliest of all was its outsized skull, a human skull with deep sockets framing yellow, snake-slitted eyes that stared unblinking at the crowd.
Then he saw its Spark. Unlike the others, it was a twist of color, burning red and pink. It had a line connected to him.
“Kill it!” Mandri shouted.
The Ayramun all laughed.
“Not worth the effort,” said Seb.
“But it’s a demon!”
“You have a sword, don’t you?” said Moto, snorting. “If you want to kill it, then kill it.”
Mandri could almost feel the demon’s teeth sinking into his flesh, scratching another nick into his thigh bone.
“Demons is hard to kill,” Ayram asserted. “Easy to wound, but if that’s all you do then you have to chase it.”
“It…it…it,” Mandri stammered, unable to express a cogent thought.
“Calm down,” said Seb. “Demons are dumber than Schisol’s shadow. They’ve got no pride when they’re alone.”
Moto added, “You’ll be fine as long as you don’t present yourself as meat.”
Mandri couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He’d heard a million rumors about demons, and not one suggested that they were dumb.
Seb said, “Moteah hit it with a rock and the damned thing thinks we can’t see it. I got eye contact, and it still thinks I don’t know it’s there.”
Ayram reached down, grabbed an Ayram-sized throwing stone and turned the heavy thing around in his hand until he found a good grip. He fixed his gaze upon the demon, and his long arm whipped and zipped that rock straight at that demon’s mouth.

SMACK!

The rock exploded into fragments and dust, and the demon shrieked as it flew backwards into a tumble. Blood gargled out of its smashed up snout as it tried to scramble upright, but Ayram’s stone had robbed its legs of confidence. It juddered, slipped, and fell again. It was such a broken mess that Mandri almost felt bad for it. 
Eventually it staggered up on all fours, then limp-sprinted away, zig-zagging left and right as if unsure of which way to flee. Then it came to a sudden stop and squatted back down in the dirt, re-assuming the shape of a rock.
It was hidden—or so it thought.
“Makes good target practice,” Ayram muttered.
Then a bright idea flashed in his wild eyes. “Let’s have Mandri have a go.”
He grabbed Mandri and lifted him up, then lifted Obo’s litter off his back, then spun the Mazid around so that Obo faced the demon.
“Summon the Mazidfire.”
Mandri heard the command but paid it no heed, for he was stunned by the sight of Obo, whose pseudospark glowed dim in his distended stomach. A thread connected Mandri to Obo, and it was thick, the thickness of a finger, and it was brighter than any other in sight. A white light throbbed through it, sourced from Mandri’s Spark, and where it merged through Obo’s pseudospark, that white exploded into a web of shifting color which pulsed in waves through all of Obo’s skin, revealing contours of his scrawny, severed self underneath his robes. 
The color was richest in Obo’s revealed face, where his once-white skin now glistened with iridescent purpose. And his eyes, the sheen of his silver eyes was subsumed by a flow of rainbowed color.
“Go on,” said Obo, oblivious to his stunning beauty.
A grumbled sigh broke out behind him.
It was Elrahet. So wrapped was she in purpose that she seemed little more than a standing spool of glowing yarn. She waddled towards Mandri, and she seemed to drag the world along with her. 
“Focus,” she said. “Breathe.”
Mandri sipped a breath to recompose himself. 
Then he realized that she was about to enthrall him as she’d done before in that pit, and his fear was realized when her bony hand jutted out of the threads wrapping around her, and in that hand was a golden knife.
She slashed the air in front of Mandri’s stomach, and in one swift stroke, the threads connecting Mandri’s Spark to everyone else’s were severed.
His whole body pulsed with color and his mind slumped into its seat.
His Spark had only one bright string left, the one connecting him to Obo.
“Think of nothing but the Mazid,” she mumbled. 
Mandri had no choice.
The witch began to circle, and as she did she pruned Mandri’s handless arm of purpose.
“Reach out with your arm,” she said, and her words tugged at the severed fibers lining his arm, weaving them into a new purpose.
He reached out.
He could feel his missing hand as if it were still there, and he could feel it squeezing Obo’s heart, squeezing it in time with the pulse of his own Spark.
He poured all his energy into that hand, and when he did, Obo’s bald head twitched.
“Summon the fire!” Elrahet shrieked, and Mandri felt his Spark burn.
An urge welled up his stomach, and Obo’s shoulders crimped. That urge spread through Mandri’s whole body and sped through his arm, and as it did, a faint golden glow began to shine through the skin of Obo’s throat.
The Mazid opened his mouth towards the heavens, and as just as Mandri’s eye caught sight of a spark of golden fire, a searing pain shot through his severed wrist and he shrieked, “EAUUUGGHH!!!”
It felt as if the circle of the sun had fallen from the heavens and sliced right through his missing hand.
He collapsed and twisted in pain.
Through the agony he heard Moto say, “Interesting. He almost did it.”
Mandri writhed around for a finger more, clutching his severed wrist against his chest. By the time he was back inside his own skin, only Ayram and Obo remained. The rest had resumed their journey.
“That’s good enough for now,” said Ayram, and he left as well.
When Mandri sat up, the God’s Eye sight was gone.</Text>
            <Notes>Later, Mandri and Obo chat about what happened. - ithink I know why she chose me - she can control me. It was so easy for her.
It seems like I can do it.
It wasn’t me, it was her.
The pain.


HERE the mazidfire is golden.


Mandri suceeds but supresses?

 of unveiled purpose

The pain obo must feel

- does that happen every time? 

Yes.

A friend’s daughter ran to give me a hug. She headbutted me in the uglies. It was the worst pain I ever felt. The dull ache lasted for a month.

Mandri shuffled his legs underneath him into a frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up.

            <Title>Meskalim</Title>
            <Text>Meskalim was one of the first cities to rise when the holy continent was pulled from the waters. On the earliest maps it was nothing but a nameless black dot sitting halfway down Jandri’s western rim. Nobody cared for a small flesh market that merchant barges skipped on the way down around the horn and east to Jeket.
This all changed when a young slave slipped and fell into a hole. What that girl was doing in the foothills of the Hias mountains, so far from the city, only Solraheen knows. Some say that she was lured down into that hole by Solraheen’s dark twin, Schisol, because the entrance to that void was nothing but a black sliver in the grass—impossible to find unless one knew where it was. When the girl was rescued from the earth she was clutching a nugget of gold.
The shepherd who found her went back to that crack the next day with an oil lamp. Twelve feet down, his eye caught the glint of a gold stringer slanting sideways through the granite. He followed it through a tight-fitting pocket, and there in that fracture he found a vein of gold that was wider than his arms could stretch. 
Mines were driven into the hills. No real thought was given to managing the uncountable tons of rock that were pressing down on the blooming network of tunnels. When the people of Meskalim dug into the earth they put up wood beams and packed the walls tight with a stiffening mud, but that was it. They didn’t understand that the granite there was fiercely jointed and that a beam supporting one rock might be doing nothing for another just a few inches away. The odd cave-in should have served as a warning. One might be tempted to say these ancient peoples didn’t understand the danger because they were blinded by greed, but the simpler truth was that they were invincibly ignorant. 
Meskalim became a golden city on the maps of a golden age. Its thousand white domes were enameled with sacred geometry. Its boulevards were filled with all the peoples of the world. Its army was twice the size of any other. Its port was the very center of the earth. All of this because of gold, for gold is Solraheen’s stone, as bright and as immutable as the divine. Leave it in the dirt for a million years and it will stay as brilliant as the day it was interred. Roll it around in the hands and it provokes a yearning akin to spiritual rapture—a yearning for more, for as much as one can get. The folk of Meskalim devoted their lives to it. They followed the gold wherever it went, even under the city itself.
Then one day a miner slammed his pick into the wrong hairline crack. The waters of the Shalbrum sea flooded in. When the thinned bedrock fell, the golden city above fell with it. More than five hundred thousand people were swallowed up in the slush of earth, though the number grew larger with each retelling.
But humans are redoubtable creatures when gold is at hand, so it didn’t take long for the city to be rebuilt from scratch further south. Meskalim the second swelled anew, though it would never be as grand as the first. Whenever a nugget of gold was pulled from the ground it was stored in a dockside warehouse before being shipped across the sea or down and around to Jeket. Folks feared the earth might open up at any time to eat their treasures, so common sense demanded that the wealth would be better used elsewhere.
And so, for a thousand years, Meskalim’s temple was poor and its people poorer. Its streets weren’t laid out with any sense, much less paved, and these mucky avenues didn’t adhere to the natural contours of the land because when someone wanted to build a house they simply plopped it down wherever inspiration struck. And these houses were ugly things, shouldn’t be called houses—they were dwellings, crumpled slugs of mud, lumber, and straw with windowless walls all askew. There wasn’t a true roof beam in all the lower city. A horde of these things were smashed up against each other like one big deposit of mud that the Istil wind had just happened to blow together.
Mandri couldn’t stand the sight of it unless he was deep in a burgeon binge.
Unfortunately, he had to pace his beer because he couldn’t afford to be so run through that he couldn’t walk. He had to feather the drink’s effect, take sips every hundred staggered steps or so to keep himself bouncing off that point of no return. It was a dangerous game, taking off the edge in chunks, but it was one he was determined to play to avoid thinking about that witchy bitch’s bloody, haunting face. 
She was walking right in front him.
Her shawl and shoulders were splattered red from Gil’s blood. She might have drawn a crowd if the streets weren’t empty on account of the rain. There were a few farmers muddling about, shouldering clod-mallets and rakes, leading donkeys panniered with half-empty baskets. These men took one look at Pel and darted down alleys that did not lead to where they wanted to go.
Mandri might have followed them, but he was being drawn deep into burgeon bliss. He’d seen his reflection in a puddle, and his pupils were blown wide open. The smallest slight of light could get in there, bounce around, and blind him to all ugliness.  The baffled gray light of a rain-cloud sun made every surface sparkle. The falling rain dazzled. Even the cool muck welling up between his toes was flecked with radiant light.
The more Mandri drank, the more the burgeonsight played with light and wetness. Soon the sparkling bits of light themselves were tangible, like he could get them glommed up between his fingertips and lick them.
He lingered in the middle of an empty crossroads, surrounded by some of the blobbiest mud-caked slums in all of Meskalim. Each roof was topped off with little nipple chimneys and there wasn’t a wooden door in sight—only rags hanging down to cover their lamplit, onion-smelling interiors. Mandrameen stood there like an idiot, back hunched, hair drenched, brown robe slipping off his shoulder, for he was struck dumb by the sight of his own hand.
He held it up and studied it. His own skin was sparkling. In the hollow of his palm was a pool of that starry substance. He tried to touch the little sparkles, tried to rub them off, but that was no good because his fingers were sparkling too. This wasn’t merely wetness, he was sure of it.
He licked his index finger and a heavenly sensation flooded into his mouth. It was a tingling flavor that tasted like honey mixed with the vigor of youth. It tasted like the smell of a field of wildflowers. It tasted like apple-juice mixed with god.
He squealed with delight. 
He bent down and scraped up a dollop of mud with his finger, then licked it. Again, his mouth was flooded with the flavor. 
“What are you doing!?” Pel screeched as she doubled back to fetch him.
“I see Solraheen’s light!” Mandri shouted.
Pel snatched Mandri’s beer-skin out of his hand.  “You’ve had enough,” she said as she threw the skin over one of those nipple chimneys.
Mandri groaned his disappointment. Pel grabbed his wrist, and off they went. They moved as fast as Mandri’s slipping feet could manage, and soon they were at the base of Meskalim’s central hill. This sharp hill towered over the muddy rumps of the city below, and its faces were studded with white buildings, each clinging on like barnacles on a washed up corpse. These buildings were the various offices of the Hrkan government, as well as the mansions of the people who staffed them. The largest building was the residence of the Lord Salavan Soreen. All Mandri knew of the man was that, at forty-two, Lord Salavan the youngest of the eight Hrkan Lords. His palace claimed a privileged vista at the top of the hill’s southern cliff. Its wide balcony leered over the rest of the city’s mud rumps.
Pel stepped behind Mandri and pushed him into a stuttering trot.
It was hard trudging up the hill. Mandri’s legs were completely out of wire when he came upon Salavan’s walls. And what monstrous walls they were. Mandri hated walls. These walls were among the most perverse. They were huge, four-men tall, and their only purpose was to stand there and look daunting so that poor Meskalimi didn’t get any ideas. And most walls that big in a place as wet as Meskalim are streaked with black and yellow grime dripping to the street, but Salavan’s walls were pristine, with plaster as white as the day it was slathered on. No doubt Salavan spent more money cleaning that wall than he spent on bread for widows and orphans, or for anything for anyone. That wall’s raw materials could buy at least fifty slaves. Its maintenance, five slaves a year.
At least this wall was doing a job in keeping him out. Some walls on the lower rungs of Meskalim’s hill couldn’t keep out a flying shit. They’re purely decorative. Imagine that—a decorative wall—it’s not even trying to fend off the starving masses, all it's doing is letting them know they aren’t wanted.
Mandri stood in front of the street-side wall, drooling. The burgeonsight was warping all the little dimples and scratches and faint finger-drags that were imprinted in the plaster. He couldn’t shake the feeling that the wall was daring him, like a schoolyard bully, to just try to breach it and see what happens.
There was a squared-out arch in the middle of this wall, and underneath this arch was an ironwood gate guarded by two thugs on either side. These brawny men were huddled close to the gate so as to squeeze themselves inside the narrow shelter of the arch. It wasn’t doing them much good. They were as sodden as Mandri. Like everything else, the burgeonsight was making them sparkle. That didn’t stop them from looking like demons.
In the best of light, a Meskalimi thug’s face is an unsettling thing. A lifetime of trading violence for money fixes a man’s expression into a state of permanent concern, and once the brow and cheek get slashed with scars, the whole thing looks of putrefied misery. Blur that face a little with rain, twist it with burgeonsight, and now it’s a demon’s face that could bend the bravest spine.
And they had swords; short, street-wise swords clipped to high-waisted belts.
They couldn’t be full-fledged demons, because such demons should be greasing the feet of backsliding priests, or tricking young beauties into thinking that taking it up the bum doesn’t count.
One of the demons peeked out from under the arch and shouted, “Hey—scram, boy!”
“Git yous butt gawn,” the other said. His vowels were as stubborn as a mule.
Mandri did not know that demons had regional accents. It sounded like this demon grew up in a sun-slum near Iskabat. The first demon had no doubt crawled out of a Jeketian gutter, for his lilt and swagger could only have come from someone steeped in the capital of the Hrkan world.
Pel stepped from behind Mandri, and both demons shrank back.
“Open the door,” she snarled.
The Iskabati bowed and opened the gate’s cutout door. He stepped aside, and so did Pel as she motioned for Mandri to enter. 
If there were alternative options, Mandri couldn’t see them. He knew that there were an infinite number of possible paths his life’s direction could take, and presumably some of these didn’t lead him through that Hrkan Lord’s door. But burgeonsight has a habit of narrowing all possibilities down to the few right in front of his face.
This was why burgeons were so despised by so many, because they dull any sense of the future and that leads to a ruined life. Mandri would argue that everyone walks through life’s infinite possibilities with their eyes set on a narrow array of options, so if sober people are ignoring an effective infinity, what’s the harm in sipping on burgeons to ignore a couple more? At least he wasn’t trying to build walls, those literal embodiments of the restriction of possibility. People who build walls are higher on fear than Mandri had ever been on burgeons.
With out really knowing he was doing it, he stepped through.
Pel did not proceed with him. And as the door clanged behind him, a shiver ran through his spine.
It’s amazing how fast he could come to regret a decision.</Text>
            <Notes>He began to wonder if this oily celestial film that coated every surface was always there, burgeons or no.

            <Title>Amalgamete</Title>
            <Text>There’s nothing complicated about terror. Mandri was all too familiar with its tired routine—first it startled him into stupidity, and then it spurred him into action, or petrified him, according to the flavor of the moment. There was no fighting it. When Mandri saw that hag-beetle, he became terrified, and that terror only gained on him as he fled through the temple’s dark bowels.
He bumped his nose and toes on stone shelves and cabinet footings because he wasn’t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn’t allowed, according to Moto, because there wasn’t any time, even though Moto took time to light one up for himself. Mandi thought Moto was being unreasonable, but that’s how it goes with terror, it pushes reason aside. Mandri himself was unreasonable, because there truly wasn’t any time. He could hear a clicking somewhere in the dark behind him.
He hated these Ayramun for leading him here, but he also loved these Ayramun for protecting him from the dark. He wanted to flee from them, and he wanted to stay as close as he could. Moto led them into a dark dead end, and Mandri hated him. Moto led them into a windowed hall flush with fresh night air, and Mandri loved him. Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated her. Mandri slipped on a spot of Seb’s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated her—Seb was the sole exception to this confusing succession of emotional states which blurred together. He despised Seb entirely, but the others he loved and hated, or was it hated and loved. The fact that it was possible to love and hate a person suggested that these emotions were only crude approximations of a deeper reality which he could not articulate. It was as if there was a color portrait to be painted here but all Mandri had were pigments of black and white.
Then there were the beetles, haunting the dark halls behind. His fear of them mixed in with all of this. It reminded him, and this was not the time for it, but it reminded him of Solraheen, for His love was both comforting and terrifying. Yes, Mandri feared a loving Divine.
He hated Elrahet for her witchy mumblings as she scampered along in the dark, her torch bobbing right and left.
“This isn’t right,” she hissed through clenched teeth. “Isn’t right, isn’t right, isn’t right.”
Then he loved her when she took the lead and shouted, “This way!” like she knew where she was going.
Moteah had been right behind Mandri this whole time, and she yanked on Mandri’s arm.
“Put your sword away, you idiot!”
Mandri didn’t even know he had it out.
“You’re going to stab me,” she said.
“I won’t.”
“You’re going to stab somebody if you don’t put it away. Damn it Moto, why did you give him a sword?”
Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade, and good thing he did, because Elrahet suddenly took a sharp turn into another dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. 
“What are we doing?” Moteah asked with venom, begging to lead.
By this point Moto had lost his poise. “I say we wait here for Ayram! And if I say it, that’s what we’ll do!”
Moteah sneered and said, “You want to wait here for the beetles to find us?”
“Better to fight here than in the hall!”
Seb sucked in a hiss between her teeth. “So we jus’ bumblin’ around?”
They all looked to Elrahet.
“My foot is sore,” Elrahet said. “I need off it.”
Moto groaned and smacked the wall in frustration. “This is why I should be in charge. Ayram put me in charge. Now, I say we need to stop and think, because stumbling through the dark isn’t doing any good.”
“And how would you know?” Moteah asked.
“There’s got to be another exit.”
Mandri retreated into a dark corner of the room as the others got into an argument about how thinking about finding an exit could possibly help them find it.
Mandri wished this temple wasn’t so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. It wasn’t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps because there weren’t any fittings for them bolted onto the walls. Whoever built this place wanted it to be dark. This room had no hope of natural light—Shulgi was much too thick in the belly for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help the unrighteous lose themselves, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.
At least there was something to look at. Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around the blocky walls of this apparent dead end, and these rows were stacked upon each other from floor to ceiling. All the walls were carved up like this, and most were painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with lines of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears. There were garden scenes where Old Jandri kings strolled along in quiet contemplation. There were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of Solraheen’s dark brother, Schisol, burning martyrs who screamed as tongues of flame licked their skin.
Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that the images told. It reminded him of Hrkan tomb art—a rich man decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when he dies and the tomb’s door is sealed, no one is allowed to have a look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and then no one is looking. A monumental waste of good pigment.
No places for candles in a tomb.
No room for natural light either.
Maybe this place was to be a tomb.
Unfortunately, Mandri wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at in terms of narrative. He wasn’t even sure if he were reading the panels in the right direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether?
He looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight. It was hard to see, because not only was the light too dim, but it blinked every time Moto waved his frantic arms to try and express his argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene—the moment of Solraheen’s birth, when He emerged out of the Void. It was represented here by a blank face floating above a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark ripping out the stone. Each gash was as wide as two of Mandri’s own fingers.
“Uh, guys.”
The others were too engrossed in their squabble to hear him. Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.
Mandri raised his voice, “Hey!”
They all stopped bickering and stared.
“Look at this.”
Mandri pointed at the beastly gash in Solraheen’s forehead. Seb stepped over and studied the defacement with a critical eye. “It’s just scratches.”
“Let me see,” Elrahet grumbled as she waved Mandri and Seb aside with her torch. She stood on her tiptoes and stretched her leathery neck to sniff it. When she balanced back down on her heels, her wrinkled face was gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.
“It is as I feared,” she said bitterly, and she eyed those gathered with contempt, as if all this was somehow their fault. “No more mewling,” she growled, and she pushed past Moto, then trotted off into the darkness of the hallway, black robes fluttering, expecting everyone to follow. 
“Where are we going?” Moto roared as he took off after her.
“To find a way out!”
Moteah and Seb quickly followed, leaving Mandri alone with Obo strapped to his back.
Mandri fished around in his robe’s pocket for his burgeon. He wasn’t about to go running through a demon-infested temple without some way to see those damned beetles before they jumped. The God’s Eye sight would surely reveal their Sparks and whatever lines of purpose guided them, so he pulled his burgeon out, unstopped its tiny thorn-plug, and shook a drop of juice onto his outstretched tongue.
His journey through the dark temple halls began anew. Elrahet led the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the scratches in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was a choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because where else would a desert exit be but at the bottom of the mountain? They ventured so far down into this temple that it seemed to Mandri the building was upside down. A temple’s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens. There should be an ascension to the roof where the penitent could await the coming dawn. But he went down, and the further down he went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. 
Elrahet led them all down a wide fan of stairs. The ceiling and walls bowed out into a black void. They stumbled into a monumental underground expanse, a throne room fit for a god. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts were closing in. It was a sea of darkness, and the Ayramun’s spot of torchlight was a dinghy set adrift in it. Mandri huddled close to the others, and if hadn’t felt the hard stone under his feet, he might have lost his wits completely.
That stone had a fractal pattern etched into it—hairs of black squares lining larger squares. As he walked, this pattern gave way to a procession of obsidian-studded squares straddled on either side by enormous stone columns shaped as legs, legs whose bodies disappeared into the interminable blackness above.
Elrahet picked up speed and purpose. She led them past these columns while Mandri prayed for the God’s Eye sight to come to him, that he might see whatever demons must be hiding in the shadows above.
At pace, they reached the end of the hall unmolested, and uplifted there, on a narrow set of stairs, was a red sandstone throne. This throne’s seat and arms were smooth and featureless, fashioned from river-bloated stone, while its back was a billowing slab carved to look like flame licked into a curl by an unseen wind. Etched into the wall behind was a ring of faces, faces inside of faces—howling animals, untamed men and women, as well as snarling demons.
The throne’s seat was as empty, which is to say it was filled with dark, malevolent purpose. Mandri felt outnumbered against the great emptiness around him.
That’s when he noticed that Seb was missing. And the moment he noticed it, Moteah noticed it too.
The whites of her eyes bulged as she counted and counted again—only four were present. Only four. She counted again as if it were possible to mess up one, two, three, four.
“Where’s…where—”
The question choked her throat as she peered into the darkness behind, hoping to catch sight of Seb, but no one was there. Nor were there footsteps. Seb was gone.
Moto spun around, and upon seeing their number diminished by one, he charged back into the darkness from whence they’d come. He hadn’t gotten far when he stopped and waved his torch.
“Seb!” he shouted.
A silence, followed by Elrahet grumbling, “You’ll wake Schisol Himself from the dead.”
Moto spun around. Suspicion skewed his brow. He marched up to Mandri and grabbed Mandris’ robe. “Where is she?”
“I have no idea,” Mandri replied.
“Let me see your sword.”
“What?”
“Let me see it!”
Mandri fumbled at his sword’s hilt. As he pulled it out he dropped it. It clanged on the stone floor, and in this cavernous hall the noise was magnified to a peal of thunder.
Moto clenched his jaw tight and his eyes accused Mandri of dropping the sword on purpose. Then he lowered his torch to the blade and studied the sheen of light playing upon it. He was looking for signs of use.
“Wait,” said Mandri, confused. “You think I stabbed Seb in the dark?”
“How else did she disappear?”
“It’s not like we’re in a demon infested temple.”
“You were running right behind her!”
“So?”
Moto swung the torch back up and nearly smacked Mandri in the face with it. “Did a demon drop on top of her and carry her away without you seeing? ”
“No—I mean, I don’t know. Maybe.”
Just then, a blood curdling scream echoed through the hall. The sound came from behind the throne, through a perfectly square doorway cut into the wall near the throne’s stairs.
Elrahet took off running towards it. Moto and Moteah followed. Mandri picked up his sword, and though he wanted no part of chasing that scream, the Ayramun were taking their torches with them. He followed everyone else through that square doorway and found another large hall whose length disappeared into darkness. Thankfully, the tall ceiling and walls were brushed with light. There were no demons crawling on them.
Elrahet had only taken twenty steps inside when she stopped cold.
She hunched over her cane and peered into the emptiness ahead. Mandri couldn’t see anything. Then came a faint squelching sound that brought to mind Seb’s borcandi chewing.
“Seb!” Moto shouted. His holler drew an angry side-long glance from Elrahet, and if that wasn’t enough to shut him up, a voice rose out of the dark.
It was a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed the temple itself was speaking.
“Welcome, witch.”
Mandri desperately wanted to flee but somehow couldn’t. He watched on in astonishment as Moto reached back then threw his torch straight down the hall, towards the voice.
The flaming stick went spinning through the air for a good forty yards before it clattered onto the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop at the distant wall, a wall composed of some peculiar material that looked a bit like rough-hewn stone.
“They wish to see my glory,” said the voice. “Let them see.”
Two enormous braziers on either wall erupted into flames, illuminating what Moto’s torch could not, for the distant wall was not a stone wall, it was a colossal mound of flaking skin warted over with bleeding pustules and tags of fat. This swell of flesh was so large that it plugged the room. The whole horrible thing shook as the rasping voice sounded out again, “Behold, my glory!”
The mound of flesh rolled forward, and sticking out of its top, like a cork in a wine bag, was the upper body of a skinny old man, white-bearded, shawled in a shimmering green robe. On his head was a crown, and his arms clutched a woman’s headless body. It was Seb.
This putrid king smiled in the fire’s upshot light, and this smile grew and grew until his jaw dislocated off his skull like a snake’s. He shoved Seb’s lolling neck into his gaping maw, and after he stretched his cheeks beyond reason to accommodate her shoulders, he crunched down onto her spine and began to chew.
A scream of terror died stillborn in Mandri’s throat, for arrayed around this bloated beast’s belly were hag-beetles, at least ten of them. Their ruffled black shells glinted in the light of the braziers, and their fishy, lidless eyes shimmered as they studied Mandri and the Ayramun. Mandri briefly wondered if their many legs should be considered arms because of how they ended in human hands instead of feet.
Mandri turned to flee, but was stopped by the sight of four demon beetles stuck to the wall above the exit. They clicked their legs against their shells like off-the-wagon addicts.
“We’re doomed,” Mandri muttered.
 Moto and Moteah stood in shock, eyes flitting between the great beast and another group of hag-beetles crawling on the ceiling. Only Elrahet showed no fear. She took a step towards Salavan and the beast and bowed deeply, as if petitioning an ordinary outland court. “Greetings, my most repugnant king,” she said in mocking reverence.
The whole mass of the beast then shivered, for up above, the king’s distended ribcage squeezed Seb’s body down into his bloated stomach. The sight of his black tongue licking down Seb’s toes was almost more than Mandri could bear, and this was followed by the crack of his jaw snapping back into place.
Elrahet watched all this with a scornful glare. “You have perverted your flesh, Greskal.” She heaped ridicule upon the name. But the putrid king, this false god, only laughed. His laugh sent a shudder through his whole bloated body, ending in a horrible burp.
“Ech! Keep your names to yourself! Poison yourselves with names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. I am more than any name can bear. Look at me!”
He leaned his whole bulk forward to resettle his great stomach. Mandri suspected that somewhere under the calloused flabs of skin on the floor were legs, but he doubted this demon king could do much more than lean.
“I am no longer Greskal!” he thundered. “I have become…I have become, becoming itself! Name me, witch—I am Amalgamete!”
The echo of his voice filled the hall and stunned all gathered into silence, all save the hag-beetles, who chattered and clicked their chitinous mouths, vibrating with their master’s mood.
“Do you think me ugly?”
Elrahet snarled and spat at the beast.
The Amalgamete laughed again at her casual disrespect. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from tar, living tar, for in the dim light it seemed to be wriggling like a piglet. He pulled it further and let it slip, and the flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.
“This ugliness is the world,” the Amalgamete decreed as he caressed the welling redness. “Don’t you see? This pain of flesh is the pain of the world into which a Spark is thrown. The brighter the light of the Spark, the more this ugliness gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would bow before me as your God!”
Elrahet looked down her nose at this king of demons. “Your son had a stronger stomach than you,” she growled. “Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.”
A paroxysmal twitch shuddered the Amalgamete’s bulk. He pointed to Elrahet and bellowed, “Silence that Spark ensnaring womb!”
A hag beetle dropped from the ceiling.
It fell with tremendous speed, and as it did, its shell split open, revealing a black, insectoid spike which shot out and jabbed at Elrahet, but the old witch deftly stepped aside and dodged it.
The beetle crashed into the floor, and Moto’s sword lashed out and severed the spike from the beetle’s body.
The Amalgamete belched in annoyance as his wounded child scurried away. Then he issued a royal plea to all but Elrahet. “Offer yourselves willingly. Be joined together inside my stomach and know union for once in your miserable lives. And please do not struggle. Stressed meat tastes foul.”
With the natural grace of a man made king from birth, the Amalgamete twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, then waved his minions onward.
Both Moto and Moteah threw down their packs and shielded Elrahet behind them. Mandri held out his sword and assumed responsibility for watching their backs. He turned once more towards the exit. He suddenly regretted not paying more attention to Moto’s fighting lessons, though they might not have helped to prepare against five eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis arrayed above that square doorway. He would have to fight off all of them all at once.
“What do I do!?” he screamed at siblings.
“Just stab the damned things!” Moteah cried.
Mandri shrugged off his pack and let Obo fall heedlessly to the floor. The beetles fluttered their shells against their backs, preparing to jump. Mandri readied himself to stab. Then the world flashed with the white light of purpose. The God’s Eye sight had blinded him.
“Not now!” he screamed as his vision plunged into a swirling sea of iridescent light. He ducked low to the ground and swung his sword wildly in the air. He prayed for Solraheen’s protection—he spoke no words, it was a stronger prayer than that, it was a burst of raw emotion. When the white light bled away it revealed a world in which the hag-beetles had yet to jump. Mandri could see their Sparks floating inside their shells, Sparks of saturated yellow. Shimmering white threads of purpose stretched out of them and wound through the net of fate which fixed the world—four beetle threads ran up to the ceiling. One arced through the air straight at Mandri.
He would have taken it for his doom, but it stopped right in front of his nose. And there was another shimmering thread of purpose arcing there, one which wound out through the doorway and disappeared into the darkness of the throne room. 
The hag-beetle jumped. It sped through the air and its shell parted to let loose its spike, but Mandri did not duck, for he’d caught sight of a giant running through the doorway—a wild eyed giant with a bread-loaf beard. Mandri sighed in awe as Ayram swung his iron spear right through its guiding thread to break the hag-beetle’s back. An eye-blink later and the beetle smashed into the ground with a tremendous crunch.
There stood Ayram. His Spark shone brightly because of course it did, this was Ayram, glorious Ayram, the conquering hero. He even had the Mazidariga child underneath his arm. When he yanked his spear out of the beetle’s belly, the beetle spasmed, its Spark dimmed, and its eight legs and many fingers twitched feebly a moment more.
The four other hag-beetles, seeing this, scurried up to the ceiling and fled back down the hall, following their threads of purpose back towards the Amalgamete.
Ayram dumped the dead Mazidariga next to the dead Obo.
“Get to work,” he grumbled as he brushed past Mandri.
Mandri could not move for he was transfixed by the net of purpose which floated about the room. Thousands of shimmering threads criss-crossed the way towards the Amalgamete, and it seemed that Elrahet was the locus of this creation. Her golden Spark was as bright as the sun, cocooned by threads of purpose. Some of her threads extended out of the room in either direction, and some shot straight up through the ceiling. The sight of it all instilled Mandri with the confidence that they would be victorious, for it was clear to Mandri that her purpose did not end inside this room.
But in truth she was outshone by the Amalgamete, whose Spark was a constellation of shimmering spheres of every size and color, and all of them were webbed together inside his bloated stomach. Mandri watched in wonder as these glowing links pulsed, merged, and split apart, while some knots popped like bubbles into sparkling rainbow dust which coalesced into new lines of purpose that stretched out into the world.
If the Amalgamete were not a god, then he was close to it, for only something divine could build new lines of purpose and set the world into motion. But if he was divine, his flesh was not a suitable vessel. He was lost in the throes of some belly-aching fit. It seemed as if the skinny king on top was about to vomit.
 “A moment!” the Amalgamete shouted. “We have gifts for all of you, if you’ll only wait a moment.”
“Not interested,” Ayram said as he lofted his spear onto his shoulder and stepped towards the evil gathered across the room.
The putrid king’s eyes rolled into white and he punched his body hard enough to knock loose some internal blockage. He moaned and threw his head back as his shoulders cringed and quivered. A cosmic wave rolled under his great bulk and the constellation inside his stomach rolled inside his innards. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder, and the Sparked web was pulled and stretched until a glob or red light snapped loose. When it did, the king above coiled up and screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered.
A boil the size of a wagon wheel burst open. Blackness oozed out of this new cavity, and when the next shudder came this hole ripped wider. Out of this orifice poured a great red lizard demon slathered in tar, Sparked, it seemed, by fire.
Half woman, it stood up on two legs. Half keenkedra, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It wore the muscles of a prize-winning ox, and when it stood up to its full height, it was bigger than Ayram by a head. Its eyes, double lidded, were blood red like its scales, and its pupils reflected the fiery glow of its murderous Spark. 
The beast licked the air with a forked tongue, and it hissed as it stretched out its limbs for the first time—its arms were ribbons of muscle, its back a whip, its jaw was full of hateful fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself and delighted in its power.
It slowly turned and set its glowing eyes on Ayram. It let loose a low, purring hiss. 
In response, the hag beetles all clicked and scratched their spikes inside their shells before turning their dumb, lidless eyes back towards the Ayramun.
Then they began to crawl.
“The Mazid!” Ayram shouted. He twirled his spear under his right arm and spat a challenge towards the newborn freak. A snarl of fangs was the reply, and the lizard demon took one step towards its prey.
The beetles continued to click their excitement while Moto and Moteah herded Mandri and Elrahet into a corner. Mandri dragged Obo and the Riga along by their wrists, though he kept his eyes on the hag-beetles as they scuttled on towards him. The hands at the end of their thin beetle legs slapped the stone like awkward applause. They circled around Ayram and the newborn lizard demon and headed straight for Mandri’s corner. Their numbers on the ceiling swelled. Mandri could just make out the dull shine of eyes as a hag-beetle darted into the darkness directly above him. He could see its yellow Spark clearly, and attached to it was a single thread of inevitable purpose which dropped right down at his feet.
They had to hurry. Elrahet had to wake Obo back up.
Mandri set the two pale bodies right next to each other, and as he rolled the Riga’s shoulder’s flat he noticed that its chest had a spear-sized hole in it. It’s stomach was missing. Obo’s pseudospark was missing.
Mandri looked up at Elrahet, who was so shrouded in the white light of purpose that he wondered if she could even see the gaping wound.
Beyond her, Ayram roared, and the distance between him and the newborn demon was closed so fast that it seemed only a single leap. The thunder clap of their meeting unleashed chaos in the room. So much happened so fast that Mandri couldn’t keep track.
Down on the floor, three hag-beetles jumped at once—maybe it was more, Mandri wasn’t sure because the rush of bodies, limbs, and twisting threads of fate blurred all motion beyond bewilderment. At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. And before Mandri could raise his sword, Moto pivoted and brought his own blade down on the hag beetle’s back. In a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue behind the beetle’s head.
This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him. Though its head tumbled to the floor, its body wasn’t fully dead, instead it seized up, and one of its human-handfeet slapped Mandri in the cheek.
Mandri would have laughed if it weren’t for the sight of a hag beetle up on the ceiling dropping down—things seemed to fall faster when they were falling straight at him.
The beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri’s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle’s neck into Mandri’s face. But this was not enough to obscure his sight of the lines of purpose. One of these white filaments extended out from the attacking beetle’s back and ran a worrisome arc right through the center of Mandri’s forehead.
The beetle’s spike flew out of its back, and thanks to the guiding light, Mandri was able to twist his head out of the way.
The spike retracted, then struck out again, and Mandri ducked again, careful to keep his ear out of the bright white arc which mapped the spike’s path through the future.
Mandri laughed, because he felt like he was cheating, and twice more, the bumbling spike tapped against the stone next to his cheek.
“Idiot!” Mandri shouted.
The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that its lidless saucer eyes were staring right down at him.
“Sorry!”
Mandri tugged hard on the dead beetle body between them, and as the spike flew down once more it met instead with the dead beetle’s shell. Mandri hid himself beneath this carapace as the beetle above tried to smash through it, and he hid like this until, by the grace of Solraheen, that dumb beetle’s head was severed and fell right in front of his nose.
Moteah pulled her sword out of it.
“Get up!” she urged.
Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles, but his hips and thighs were pinned. 
“Kick it off me!”
Moteah kicked the top beetle and Mandri was able to push himself free from the other. He got to his feet and wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage—eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smashed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back across the hall. One of these hags ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the newborn demon, and that beetle was sliced in half by the lizard’s thrashing tail.
Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his iron spear so fast that it seemed to curve, and it snapped suddenly straight against the lizard’s fending tail. Sparks flew, the demon recoiled and raged, then it leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand. Ayram sidestepped, and the demon followed through with its tail to knock Ayram’s spear aside just as the next spinning set of talons were coming round.
Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below a beheading blow, and leapt away, leaving nothing but a swirl of dust between them.
Not only were their movements fraught with impressive power, but their limbs traced through swirling white arcs of purpose. It was a moving image which melted Mandri’s mind. He resolved then and there to apologize to Moto if they ever made it through this alive, as this fight was indeed a work of wondrous art, as captivating as any other, as revealing, as honest, and it had him rapt in core-collapsing wonder. And when the giants paused their brawl to gather themselves, Mandri saw how badly they’d ravaged each other. 
The demon’s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram’s robe was half-clawed off and ribbons of his flesh hung down his side, exposing the yellow fat, the red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time he exhaled. 
The swirl of white light that was Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked Moteah’s rump.
“Help him!” she shouted.
Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag beetles easily enough, but this newborn was an enemy beyond them.
“Go!” Elrahet screamed.
Moteah took off running towards the battle, her purpose clear. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first. He followed, and they got halfway towards Ayram when the demon noticed them. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and crouched down like a cat to retreat back down the hall. Its long tail was raised like that of a scorpion. 
Elrahet turned to Mandri and drew her golden blade. He could not see her face through the bright white shroud of purpose. Her hand trembled as it lifted the knife up above her head.
Mandri panicked. “What are you doing?!”
The old witch thrust her knife downwards in a swift stroke.
But it was not aimed at Mandri.
She brought it down upon her own bright purpose, and the golden blade, curved and gleaming, sliced right through the shimmering threads. The frayed ends splayed out into a tufted cloud, and Elrahet emerged from this mist clad in her usual black robed, leathery self. An eye blink later, and she was completely free of all divine light, save for the light of her Spark. It had only taken one swift cut to unwed herself from the world.
She smiled at Mandri, a gummy, toothless smile. Mandri was utterly confused as to what this could possibly mean, but there was no time to wonder, for in the distance behind Elrahet he saw the newborn jump all the way to the ceiling. Its arc carried it over the heads of the three warriors, and it hit the ground running straight for Mandri and Elrahet.
Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled hiss underneath its permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift strides, and its final leap was tremendous. The sheer size of it could crush them both, but curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery—Ayram’s spear.
The demon rolled under it.
Ayram missed.
In committing himself to the blow he’d left himself open to the lizard’s scything tail, which did not miss—it ripped a gash across Ayram’s chest.
The lizard demon then crashed into Mandri and Elrahet and sent them sprawling. 
When Mandri recovered a moment later, he expected to feel the demon hollowing out his head, but the demon’s great arm lay atop him, lifeless. Elrahet’s golden blade was hilted in the top of its skull.
Mandri struggled to push himself out from under the dead demon. Elrahet was lying on the demon’s other side. Mandri’s own sword sticking out of her stomach. A chill of horror crawled through Mandri’s skin as realized he must have accidentally stabbed her in the flurry. He rushed over and tried to help, but could tell from the absence of breath that she was already dead.
A gargling gasp sounded from behind, and Mandri spun in fright. There was Ayram. Ayram and a river of blood flowing out from the fissure in his chest. Ayram gasped again and he dropped to his knees, then fell backwards. Moto, sprinting up from behind, caught the giant’s fall. Moteah was there too, though she kept on running, and when she caught sight of Elrahet dead by Mandri’s sword, grief and hopelessness broke her.
She huddled over Elrahet. Her shaking hands could not believe the blood which wet the witch’s robes. She wiped the blood away with her own robe, then gently brushed Elrahet’s hair with dewy eyed devotion.
“They come!” Moto hollered. He lay Ayram down before turning to face the onrushing beetle horde.
“Let them come,” Moteah said as she gnashed her teeth and fought back tears. But she thought better of it when her brother shrieked in pain as his leg was sliced by a hag-beetle’s stabbing spine. She picked up her sword again, roared her fighting fury, and then ran to join her brother’s futile act of bravery and defiance.
Mandri stayed by Elrahet’s side. Her golden Spark was still there—his sword was stuck right through it. And there was still one thread of purpose sprouting out of it. It was thin, almost invisible, and it was tethered to Mandri.
Mandri pulled his sword out of her belly and cast it aside. Then set his lips to her wound, and he sucked her Spark into his mouth. This pure divinity sloshed atop his tongue and the taste of it filled his whole being with ecstasy. The urge to swallow was overwhelming, but that was not what he was meant to do, for a thread of purpose tethered him to Obo’s corpse, and it was shining bright.
Mandri hustled over to Obo’s lifeless body and squeezed his jaw open. He spit Elrahet’s Spark into the Mazid’s mouth. He drew back, hoping that he was done and that Obo would rise, but the Spark simply puddled in the back of Obo’s throat and did nothing.
Mandri recalled how Elrahet had muttered some guttural speech to bring Obo back after Minting rock. It was something like Old Jandri. 
He didn’t know any Old Jandri.
He didn’t know any invocations or incantations which might reweave the threads of purpose, or direct a Spark to his will. The only sacred words he knew were from that pre-meal Solitant prayer, a prayer that wasn’t life affirming, it was life denying. Embedded in it was the thought that life is a terrifying thing. Life kills. Life kills, and it eats what it kills, and for some reason, people fear death. Yes, that is what makes life, life—it kills and eats, and it kills and it eats. One should not fear death, fear life!

Consumed by the body
	So that it can
Feed the Spark
	So that it can
Move the flesh
	So that it can be

It was a mantra which could only be completed when repeated. Mandri spoke it, and he repeated it, and as he whispered it to Elrahet’s Spark he willed it to move with his feeling. To his delight, a tiny thread of purpose stretched out of that Spark and wandered down Obo’s throat. It wiggled like a worm seeking sustenance. Mandri wasn’t sure whether his ritual refrain or his raw desire drew that thread into being, so he continued on doing both, and he strained with the effort. The harder he focused, and the more he lost himself in the flow of words and emotion, the further the thread traveled on. It went taut when it hit the Mazid’s stomach, and suddenly the shimmering gold Spark zipped down to take up residence in Obo’s belly.
 Obo’s whole body pulsed with light, and he awoke with a fresh face, and bright eyes, as if nothing had happened at all.
He sat up, alert as ever.
“Hello Mandri. What did I miss?”
Mandri simply pointed down the hall, where Moto and Moteah had their backs against the wall, surrounded by a gang of beetles.
“Oh,” said Obo, and as casually as the sun defeats the night, he opened his mouth and shot a golden beam of Mazidfire through the room. He swiped it in a downwards arc, and all at once, a line of twelve  hag-beetles were cut in half.
The Amalgamete unleashed a dreadful, squelching scream.
“AIIIEEEEEEEEEGHHhhhhghghh!”
He was not at all pleased to see Obo burn his children. And he was not at all pleased to find himself afraid. And upon this afeard and fearsome beast, Obo let loose a powerful bolt of purging fire. The flame merely smashed into the Amalgamete’s flesh and fizzled, leaving only a scorch mark.
The beast laughed as if tickled, but Obo resummoned his flame, and this time he held it steady. He held that beam so long that his own throat heated up to incandescence. This roaring flame was a relentless lance, and it popped through one of the Amalgamete’s great sores. It poured into the demon king’s stomach, heated the insides, boiled them up until sputtering, bubbling blobs of super-heated bile splashed out. Up above, a hiss of steam shot out of the putrid king’s throat, and when Obo finally calmed his fire, the whole beast slumped down, deflated. It appeared to melt into a simmering puddle of its own black bile and blood.
The Amalgamete was dead.
What beetles were still alive went scurrying into the darkness beyond. Obo was content to rub his throat and watch them leave. Meanwhile, Moteah collapsed in exhaustion. Moto shook his head in disbelief at the dead Amalgamete.
Then he eyed Obo and snorted. He seemed as displeased to see the Obo moving as he was pleased at the sight of his boot kicking a hag beetle’s head across the floor.
Obo asked him, “Why so upset? Would you prefer to have lost?”
“We have lost!” Moto shouted. “Ayram is dead! Elrahet is dead!”
“So?”
“So? SO!? That witch was the last vestige of Solraheen’s grace on this earth. She battled evil for untold ages, and now she’s gone. She is gone, and her enemy still lives.”
“You are referring to Schisol’s Shadow?”
“Who else?
Moto’s question went unanswered, but not because it flustered Obo. Obo was simply unconcerned. But Mandri was very much concerned. He’d played too big a role in all this for it to end badly. Guilt forced him to blurt out, “Why not kill the other witch? Schisol’s Shadow, I mean. We have Obo, we have his Mazidfire. Let’s find her and kill her.”
Obo said, “That sounds like a reasonable solution.”
“You can’t kill her,” Moto said. His calm delivery belied the fact that his frustration was boiling over. “She wasn’t supposed to die!”
“Then how did Mandri manage it?”
The tension in Moto’s shoulders snapped, and he stammered out a meek, “I have no idea.” 
Mandri snickered and gathered himself together. He picked up Obo’s litter and carried it over to the Mazid, then patted him on the shoulder. “Let me carry you for another while,” Mandri said. “Let’s go find another enemy to burn.”
Obo smiled and climbed into the litter.
“What about you two?” Mandri asked the siblings. “Are you coming?”
“Coming where?”
Mandri shrugged. “I’m sure Shis can’t be far away. There’s got to be a demon hole in the ground around here somewhere. Come on, what else are you going to do? This is what you’re here for, right? Ending evil? Well, let’s end it.”
Before Mandri left the room, he yanked Elrahet’s golden knife from out of the lizard demon’s head. With this, he hoped to shape the future.</Text>

            <Title>Ambush</Title>
            <Text>Seb hated the waiting that came before an ambush, for the future was coming and with it came death or glory. It was hard not to get excited and make expectations. She dreamed of death and glory. She’d been anticipating this particular chance for weeks. Her expectations were built up so high that they’d gone past giddy excitement and had hardened into a sense of impending doom, such that she felt certain she was going to die. Glory was less certain. She reminded herself that she’d felt this way before in the last ten big ambushes, and she’d always come out alive.
But there were Ayramun who’d been through it twenty times and died on the twenty first.
It was horrible, this feeling, and being forced to sit with it made it worse to be the ambusher than the ambushee. Travelers in the Sand might be expecting to encounter some gang of hard-up outland pokes, but they expected to live through it or they never would have set out in the first place. Death comes as a surprise for them, and their dread is short lived. It wouldn’t be close to what Seb went through. Those people were lucky they died so quickly.
Then again, maybe they weren’t lucky, because it might be true that the only thing that matters in life is what the mind is like at the exact moment of death, because when the Spark drops out of time, who knows, those last thoughts might be crystallized for all eternity. If one’s last moment is agony then it’s agony forever. Get lucky and it's a deep sleep. Get unlucky, get ambushed in the desert and a sharpened point of iron finds the forehead and scratches the brain, that look of shock and surprise can get fixed on the skull. Sometimes it sets hard as stone. There’s not much comfort in the fact that these terrified faces eventually get wiped away when some gummy mouthed, flat faced lizard waddles in and chews it up, because by that point the Spark is already good and gone.
And if all that were true, it could happen to Seb.
She could get unlucky.
Of course it wasn’t luck, it was all part of a divine plan, but ‘luck’ and ‘bad luck’ were just words describing the same thing. Ultimately it didn’t matter what she called it, she worried about it all the same.
This particular ambush was feeling more risky than most. The plan to take out the Mazid and its Minder had to play out exactly as expected, or else all the Ayramun would be killed. If a Mazid were free to run amok, they would be killed. Without a doubt, killed. A Mazid could wipe out an entire army by itself. And even if they did take the Mazid down cleanly, there’d be fifty to eighty men of unknown prowess that needed killing. If they were Hrkan Skulsi, that would be too much. 
Fifty-to-eighty.
Maybe ninety.
There were only forty three Ayramun with fifteen arrows each. Seb’s rule of thumb was that arrows go roughly three-to-one, misses to hits—depending, of course, on the skill of the archer. She didn’t have an aptitude for numbers, but it seemed like there weren’t enough arrows. It would be close, and close was dangerous. And their arrows were a kind of shit—the tips were lizard’s teeth reinforcing a hardwood point. The shafts were a strong, close-grain wood, but that made them too stiff. Bandits don’t live long in the desert if they’re always scraping by, when they’re scraping by with lizard’s teeth they tend to die quite quickly. 
She knew she wasn’t the only one worried about it all because the rest of the Ayramun were as quiet as declawed cats. Even the three lizard brothers who never stopped joking around, they were quiet. Ambushes usually weren’t an exception for them. A gold caravan could be passing right by and they’d find fun in risking discovery by tumbling a stone down a rocky slope, or blundering a fart and then claiming later that they couldn’t help it. Even these idiots were keeping low and moving slowly, naught but skinny shadows being whipped to and fro by Moto’s whistled calls though the Junei hills. 
There was no forgiving horsing around because the rumor was that a Mazid’s eyes were as good as Moto’s rock crystal lenses, and a Mazid’s ears were as good as a spade-eared bat. That caravan was close enough now that if a Mazid truly was in their midst then its superfine senses would uncover their trap if they weren’t careful. Despite this, when their troupe came to halt in a narrow valley, Seb dared to climb up the slope and sneak a peek over the crest of the hill. She could just pick out the brownish speck of that caravan against the white of the Junei plain.
She was trying to gauge the manpower when Moto hissed a whisper at her.
“Seb! Get down!”
Seb spun around and there was Moto, staring daggers into her. Seb seethed like a lizard caught unawares, then reluctantly ducked back down into the shadow of the valley slope. Moto was the only one allowed to peek out over the hills and down into the spreading plain. He was the only one allowed because he’d said he was the only one allowed. Ayram had given him that authority and Seb couldn’t argue with it. If Ayram were in charge she could maybe wheedle the privilege out of him, but there was no sense in pleading a case to Moto, so Seb slid back down the valley to take up the hiding place that she’d scouted earlier in the day
It was a long, narrow valley, steep-sided, and it bowed to the left around a lumpy hill, which was good because the hill would keep their hiding places out of sight until the last moment. Still, Seb would have preferred springing the ambush in the Junei Pass proper like they usually did. Moto insisted on doing it out in the hills on account of, ‘everyone expects to be ambushed inside the pass’. Moto insisted that the best thing to do was to mirror the caravan as they made their way across the plain, then meet them in the hills and attack while their eyes were set on the gap in the mountains.
Seb appreciated the logic of it—work against expectations, but at a certain point the best land for an ambush was the best land for an ambush, didn’t matter if the unfortunate knew it was coming. People worried about ambushes in bottlenecks because bottlenecks were the best place to ambush. A valley like this was no true bottleneck. Compared to the vast expanse of the Junei plain, sure, it would do, but the slopes were nowhere near the height or steepness of a mountain shelf. The Hrks could scramble up and over them and maybe escape. It’d be like kicking off the top of an ant hill and all of a sudden it’s a free-for-all in all directions. They’d leave their wagons, but wagons weren’t what the Ayramun were after. And if those boys were Hrkan Skulsi, then the last thing Seb wanted to do was share a slope with them.
All this was building up a frightful stress. It was even getting to Moto. The man was peering through his lenses, and his searching eye was so bugged out that he looked like he was seeing straight through the stomach of Solraheen. 
Seb was close enough to him to hear him whisper, “Curse my Zosan Spark.”
Zosans had a cultural habit of being unlucky.
Young Papi, a scrawny, short, and excitable lad with a ratty face, was squatting nearby behind a stone. He heard Moto’s adumbration too, and he asked the man, “What is it?”
“They’re changing routes,” Moto answered.
“They’re what!?” Papi squeaked.
“We need to move.”
“They’re not coming through here?”
Moto ducked down from his hilltop sight-spot and he tucked his lenses back in their bag. He sat for a moment, elbows on knees, a perfect picture of contemplation, then said, “They were going to come through here, but now they’re not.”
“They changed directions?” Papi’s eyes were as wide as the moon.
Moto didn’t answer. He was back to brooding.
Papi said, “If they changed direction, then you think they know we’re here?”
“We need to move,” Moto repeated as he looked over his shoulder, as if he could see the caravan through the mound of rock. “We need to hop over a few hills.”
Big Rork’s bald, blue-eyed, jug-eared head popped out from behind a boulder to share his opinion on the matter. “We can’t move now!” he said. “The Mazid will see us.”
“We can move if we’re careful,” Moto replied. He flicked his hand in the air as if Rork’s opinion were a fly. “The caravan is still a ways out.”
Rork’s upper lip curled. This wasn’t a natural facial tick, it was something he did because he thought that flashing his teeth made him look fierce. He said, sharply, “If you can see the Mazid, the Mazid can see you.”
Papi added, “We should wait for Elrahet’s smoke.”
The rest of the forty Ayramun were scattered about on either side of the narrow valley, and every one of them was staring up at Moto, Seb, and Rork. None of them below could hear what was being said, but over the years they’d all learned to read body language from afar. Moto was doing a decent job feigning calm, but Papi and Rork’s pained expressions told everyone everything they needed to know. 
Moto picked up his unstrung recurve bow and crawled back up the hilltop.
“Papi’s right,” Seb called after him. “We should wait for the fog to move.”
“Damn waiting for that witch!” Moto cried. “If her shits not here by now, it’s not coming. We need to move.”
“What about Ayram?” Papi asked.
“Yeah,” said Rork. “Where’s Ayram?”
“Let Ayram worry about Ayram.”
From across the valley, Skitter whistled to grab everyone’s attention. Once their gazes were in hand, she pointed up to the Hias mountains behind. There, drifting out of the dark belly of the Junei Pass, was a gray, wispy mist. It was hardly noticeable, but all the same it was there and it was flooding down into the hills, growing thicker by the moment. Elrahet’s magic was coming.
The snooty look in Moto’s eyes evaporated. He beckoned Seb up to him, and Seb scurried close. Moto whispered, “That damned fog is going to make it impossible to mirror that caravan. I’m going to get down to the plain to make sure I know exactly which path through the hills they’re taking. I’m putting you in charge until I get back.”
Seb nodded. Rork overheard and was less enthused. He left his boulder and squat-walked over. “You can’t do that,” he said. “Only Ayram can put someone in charge.”
“I don’t care who’s in charge,” Moto said scornfully. “Just don’t leave this valley. Don’t even think about it.”
There wasn’t anything in Moto’s words for Rork to argue with, though the wild look in his eyes and the veins spidering out of his shaven skull said he was trying to find it. Rork was a man who was always defending his place in the pecking order. The list of men who could give him short shrift was, itself, short—there was Ayram of course, and then barely Moto. No women. Moteah could probably take him if she wanted to try with a sword, but Rork would never admit it. He had a hard enough time admitting that he’d lose a brawl to Ayram. He’d have to be dead sober, and even then it’d be all, ‘you never know’, and ‘if things happened like so-and-so’, and ‘if I were mad real proper, I could kill anything’.
Rork’s hateful eye chased Moto as the man scuttled down the valley slope. At the bottom, Moto dusted off his burnt orange robes and then did a glancing head count to make sure all the Ayramun were where they needed to be. He broke his own law of silence by saying out loud, “Alright, you idiots—sit tight, I’ll be back soon.” Then he turned and ran, disappearing around the valley bend. He was gone in less time than it took Seb to fish another borcandi spine out from her sleeve.
Seb was chewing through her spines at a prodigious rate. Moto’s leaving only made the stress worse. It was never good for discipline when a leader leaves the group, even a much begrudged deputy leader like Moto. Without a man to lead Seb knew it was only a matter of time before someone got a bright idea that needed taming. Seb figured Rork would be the first to act up, because that’s just who he was. Rork rambled back down to his chosen boulder, muttering insults and curses at no one in particular.
“Loosen up, Rork”, said Forty. Forty was an older woman with a rascal’s disposition. She playfully twanged her bow at Rork—a mocking shot at his self-importance. Rork sized up this affront with a puffed-out chest, and said, “Big show. Biiiiig show. But you better be careful, Shorty, ‘cause anything can happen in an ambush. With this mist rolling in, I might not know which way I’m shooting.”
“Same goes for me,” said Forty, tongue only half-in-cheek.
“Pipe down, Sol’s sake,” said Seb.
Forty gave Rork one final fleer, then the two marched apart and settled down to watch Elrahet’s mist bleed out of the mountains. 
The humidity had already reached them, as Seb could smell the pleasant musk of moistened earth. And up in the mountains, the mist was no longer merely a vapor, congealing as it was into a fog magic’d with purpose, spooling out into slender tendrils that slithered down into the hills. Some of these ropes of fog twirled up into the darkening sky, and there the wind caught them, lifted them higher, and splayed them out like fingers. 
A low, rolling drum of distant thunder echoed out from somewhere deep inside the mountains.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” said Papi. Seb agreed. This was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of belly magic. It was, perhaps, too good. If she could see it, then no doubt a Mazid could see it too. What a Mazid would make of it, she could only guess, and just as it was all starting to coalesce into something resembling a natural cloud of fog, a misty fissure snapped into the sky over the mountain peaks, and from it a herd of storm clouds emerged. They crept out slowly, hesitantly, like cautious cattle out of the pen, but once they were out they began to billow as they fed on the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of Elrahet’s sacrificial lizard.
Two fingers later and these storm clouds were blotting out the sun. Their gray shadows spilled down into the valleys, and not long after that the drifting fog mantled the hill behind Seb and fell upon her. Visibility dropped so low that Seb’s near-sightedness was no longer an impairment, for no one else could see much further. They all watched the valley bend to the west, even though it was out of sight, for they all expected that at any moment Moto would come jogging back to get them moving again.
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, little pricklings on the skin, a light peppering of the sandy rock and clay. Soon the raindrops swelled, and in half-a-hand they were plunking gobs of wet. 
“A bit much, isn’t it?” Papi said as he sheltered his beloved bow with his short brown cape. “Don’t she know I can’t shoot no good in the rain?”
“It’ll stop soon,” Seb said.
But it didn’t.
The rain dribbled off the rocks and stony clay, and where there were depressions and scars in the earth the rain was pitter-pattering puddles into being. These puddles grew into boot-swelling pools that overflowed their banks, and streams poured down the valley slopes, following the run of furrows that ancient rains had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millennia. Seb figured this was more water in one short span than this stretch of desert had seen in twenty years. It brought out the lizards—or rather pushed them out. A little gray bonbon popped out of the clay right next to Seb’s boot. Its swiveling eye looked mightily confused by the sudden downpour. It was so flustered that it didn’t have time to notice Seb’s heel coming down on its head. 
Seb looked over to young Papi. The boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers.
“Might as well be swimming,” the boy said. “Damn this goddamn rain!”
The curse was hardly out his lips when a gnarled flash of white lightning split through the iron mist above.

CRACKA-BOOM!

A chorus of startled yelps echoed out from the Ayramun.
Papi looked like he’d shat himself. “Elrahet’s never conjured more than a mist!” he squealed.
Tizm, a gray-scruffed old-timer stationed across the valley grumbled out, “That old bitch is gonna get us killed!”
“Where’s Moto?” came another ragged voice out of the rain.
“Screw that,” said another. “Where’s Ayram?”
From there the Ayramun began to bicker. The specific charges and insults being thrown across the valley weren’t anything new, but the stress and fear had softened everyone up so that the simplest ‘eat my shit’ cut deep. If it weren’t for the rain dampening their fighting spirit, there might have been a brawl.
Seb didn’t begrudge them their bellyaches. They’d been fed a raw meal. None of them were prepared for this kind of weather. The ground under her butt was getting slick and muddy, and if it rained any harder it would be difficult to shoot a bow because the wetter her bowstring got, the more it lost its spring. And there was no telling what a pounding rain would do to an arrow’s flight because Seb had never shot in such conditions. She knew enough to know that it wouldn’t help. For an ambush where everything had to go right, this was downright bad.
Seb began to brood and boil, but she caught herself in the act—she was torturing herself with expectations.
She needed to recenter herself.
Things weren’t bad. They weren’t good, either, but they weren’t bad.
That kind of thinking, that breaking the world into ‘good’ and ‘bad’, that was a symptom of expectations. The truth was that everything was happening exactly as it was supposed to happen.
Seb closed her eyes and thumbed a short chain of bone beads that she kept stashed in her robe, and as she did, she chanted a prayer to try and repress her simmering frustration.
	
	A well without water
		is filled with purpose,
	An arrow in the dirt
		has hit its mark,
	There is no difference
		below the surface,
	There is no self
		above the Spark.

She repeated this five, ten times as she drew her shoulders in against the rain. This plunking rain. This purpose-driven rain. The fog, the bickering, these were purposeful too—to what end, Seb wasn’t sure, but now that she was looking for purpose she could sense a great deal of it, and it was brewing something terrible. Yes, the Ayramun were about to intersect with destiny—but no—that was wrong to say, for destiny is ever-present. They were always intersecting with it. There were no bit-part players here. Poor and ragged as they may seem, these Ayramun were people, and all peoples were descendants of the first man and first woman, an unbroken chain being forged for a millennia. Each soggy, grumpy face was the culmination of a hundred thousand generations of toil, the same generations as the Hrkan Lords themselves, and so each was as important, as Lordly, for if one of them was missing then events would not unfold as they were meant to. 
But she shouldn’t privilege the living. If the rock under her feet did not exist then she would not be crouching here, she would be crouching somewhere else, and thus the future, bounded by lines of immanence extending from the present, would wind a different weave. Yes, this very rock was sacred, as all things are sacred, as the dead lizard under her boot was sacred. All things are filled with the Spark’s sacred power.
“Seb! Quit your fartin’ about!”
“What!?”
The call had come from Rork. He and a few other miserable looking louts were down on the valley floor, straddling either side of a trickling stream that was building up in the middle of the valley’s run. Seb was about to chastise them for doing Sol-knows-what when she noticed that Moto had returned and was standing in their midst. Seb leapt to her feet and filtered down the valley slope with the rest of the Ayramun. 
Down in the valley’s belly, Moto face was alight with an excitement that no one shared.
“What’s wrong with you people?” he asked. “We’re about to bag us a Mazid and you look mad about it.”
Tizm, the bent-backed wonder, kicked at the swelling stream and pointed to the sky and shouted, “The old bitch has overcooked it!”
A refrain of agreement rained down. A few voices shushed, then others shushed back. Moto tried to calm them all with plaintive hands, saying, “People. Please.”
“Please my ass!” said Tizm. “This rain is gonna ruin everything!”
“The rain is perfect,” said Moto. “It’s got the Hrks hunkered down in a valley finger.”
“The Hrks?” asked Papi.
“Yes,” said Moto with a wary grin. “It’s Hrks we’re hunting. Hrkan Skulsi.”
The admission that it was Skulsi, not Blackwood caravan men, sent a wave of discontent rippling through the gathered Ayramun. Moto tried to stem the unease by lying. Seb knew it was a lie because when Moto was working through a big lie he’d smile and whine at the same damn time, like people’s doubting faces were annoying to him. “They’ve gone and lined themselves up against a wall for us,” he said. “Jumping them will be the easiest thing in the world, but we’ve got to hurry.”
Someone on the outer edge of the huddle blurted out, “What’s this about Hrks?”
Moto raised his voice above the rain. “The Minder and his Mazid didn’t come with a Blackwood caravan. They came with a Hrkan guard.”
Another round of shouting broke out, punctuated by a flustered shout, “They know we’re here! They’ve come for us!”. Then came another round of shushing and counter-shushing. Moto again tried to calm those gathered with nothing but his frantic hands. In the end he resorted to a sharp whistle, which shut everyone right up.
Moto said sharply, “The fact that it’s Hrks doesn’t change a damned thing.”
Rork’s bald head stuck up above the huddle like a veiny, boiled egg floating in a stew. He said, “All the better it’s Skulsi! I’d rather kill a Hrk than a Jandri man!” 
Moto nodded and said, “They’re bedded down like rabbits in a long, straight ravine.”
“The one with all the karkle bushes?” Seb asked.
“They’ve all got karkle bushes in them,” Moto replied.
“The valley we’re standing in don’t.”
“It doesn’t matter,” said Moto. “All we have to do is sneak up and shoot some Hrks. It’ll be the easiest thing in the world. I know it’s raining hard, but I’m not asking you to feather an eye at ten-score yards. With this rain and fog we can get up close. You won’t miss. You can throw stones at them if you want to. You can stuff mud down their throats if you want to.”
“Where’s Ayram?” asked another.
 Frustration flashed across Moto’s face and he shot a beseeching look to the heavens before saying, “This is happening whether Ayram’s here or not. Whether you like it or not. And it’s happening now, before this rain and fog let up. Let’s get moving!”
He turned and pushed his way past a few Ayramun and set off back towards the bend. After the briefest hesitation, Big Rork marched after him, and at his encouragement, everyone else followed. Together they were a small, sad herd of outland pokes, a jumble of soggy wool-wrapped bodies and tired feet slapping the mud beside the building stream.
Seb kept to the back as they eventually climbed up and out of the valley and then crossed over a few others. They tramped through a flooding basin, and all the while Seb eyed the rainy mist with unease, for she could feel providence at work in that mist. Unlike the providence that people pray for and expect, this providence was providing something undesired, Seb was sure of that. Destructidence is what it was. Deathidence. There wasn’t an established word for it, which itself was a telling sign of the plundering spirit of the age. People only cared about signs of Solraheen’s plan so long as it was giving them something good. These Ayramun were no different.
Eventually Gugi found his way to Seb at the back of the wandering troupe. The skinny man’s face was agog with fear. He clearly wanted to talk, so Seb indulged him.
“Whaddya want?” Seb asked.
“Ya know where we headed, right?”
“I do.”
“It’s that cursed ravine, the one where I found those bones!”
“I know.”
“You should say somethin’ to the others.”
“Why not you?”
“I don’t ever say shit so no one’s gonna listen to me.”
“They won’t listen to me either.”
“They would. I would. That ravine is cursed, and people are gonna die if we get down in it.”
“I thought you said if we moved that body out of that ravine, then the curse would be moved out with it?”
“What do I know about curses? I was just sayin’ shit. For all I know that curse is what brought this storm and lured them Hrks down in it.”
“Are you tryin’ to get out of payin’ me my spines?” Seb asked accusingly.
Gugi spat a wad of borcandi juice right where Seb was stepping, clearly upset that Seb could think about debts in a time like this. Before he could voice that concern, a muted horse’s whinny was heard through the splashing rain. Everyone instinctively crouched down and rushed to the shelter of the nearest sloping mound. They were still a few-score yards away from the ravine where the Hrks were sheltering. Nothing of those troops could be seen through the mist.
Moto raced back down the line of Ayramun to crouch down next to Seb and Gugi. Voice low, he asked, “You two scouted this ravine, right?”
Gugi and Seb both nodded.
“Anything we should know about it?”
“It’s cursed,” Gugi blurted out. “We shouldn’t be here.”
“Cursed? What do you mean, cursed?”
Seb said, “This the ravine that had those bones.”
Moto snorted, almost laughed, then said, “Screw those bones. I need to know the lay of the land. I can’t see through this damned mist so I don’t know if there’s an easy out for them up on the northern side.”
“Moto,” Gugi said, leaning into his words, “I’m tellin’ you, this place is cursed. It’s gonna get us killed.”
“So what? If it’s cursed for us, it’s cursed for them too. Doubly so for them, cause they’re sitting in it.”
“Yeah, but we the ones who found the bones! We the ones that been warned! Not them. Us! Me!”
Moto gave up on Gugi and turned to Seb. “Is there any way in and out of that long stretch that might make it easy for them?”
Seb shook her head no. “That stretch is mostly steep. There’s one little nook on the north side that’s kinda like a stair but that’s it.” 
“How wide?”
“Not that wide.”
Moto paused to think, then said, “I want you two to go back a ways, and cross to the north side where you think it’s safe. Then work your way back down to where that stair is.”
“Just us two?” Gugi asked.
Moto turned and motioned towards his sister, Moteah, who was not at all enthused to be at her brother’s beck and call. Like Moto, she carried herself with an air of authority, though she was even more arrogant about it than her upfront brother, a bit cheeky, considering she was about eight years younger.
Moto looked her square in the eyes, “Get Rork and twelve others to follow Seb and Gugi. You’re going to set up on the other side of the ravine, and we’re going to try and push the Hrks towards you. So be quick and be ready. There won’t be a whistle. When they come, they come.” 
Moteah snuck away, gathered up Rork and the nearest twelve Ayramun, then brought them to Seb and Gugi. Gugi wasn’t about to take charge, so Seb crowned herself and led them all back towards the mountains, keeping the course of the cursed ravine a small-score yards away to his right. When she felt they’d gone far enough, she led them sliding down into the steep ravine, and then they had a tough, nervy scramble back up the other side. Once up, they headed back towards the plain, keeping low and quiet.
Seb knew the place she was looking for, but with the rain and mist there was no way she’d find the spot until she was already upon it. The fog was so thick that she kept second guessing whether she was even following the right ravine. Nonetheless she kept going, one foot in front of the other, trying not to think too much about the fight that was only a finger away. Soon, she was confronted with the sound of snorting wagon ponies drinking their fill of rainwater.
She crouched down, and the rest Ayramun behind did likewise. She ambled over to the edge of the ravine and slithered up against a big, solid boulder that leaned over the ravine’s lip. From there she could hear horse hooves stamping in the ravine’s stream, and if a horse was that close, then a Hrk might be closer. When she heard the clank of wood on wood she couldn’t help herself from peeking, so she steeled her nerves and peered over the boulder.
Right below her was a horse still hitched to a wagon whose bed was covered by a canvas stretched taught above the boards. Behind this wagon was another horse and another covered wagon, and whatever was behind that was lost to the mist. There was only one man. He was a natural Hrk, so far as Seb could tell, a natural Hrk with redblack hair and a full black beard that made his head seem massive. Clad in sopping wet browns, he was darting between the wagons, prepping them against the rain with all the urgency of a fellow who knew the curse that water puts on a wagon that’s been drawing dry. He drove himself insane as he scampered through the rain and fumbled with the little canvas tents that were ready-tied just above each wagon wheel. He snapped one of these sheets over a wheel-hub, and in his rush to get to another he slipped and bumped against the wagon’s boards, and this juddering loosed the latch which pinned the tailgate. The tailgate popped open, and the wagon pooped out a dead body which plopped into the mud.
It was a dead Jandri boy in a white tunic.
Seb turned to her troupe behind her. The confusion on her face must have been easy to read because Rork grumbled and invited himself up to Seb’s rock. The man kept his vein-strapped head tucked against the rock’s hump as he peered out around it.
Rork’s jaw dropped upon seeing the wagons and the lonesome wagonmaster, as well the dead body. His bulging eyes searched for some sign of the actual enemy, but found none.
“Whore’s breath,” he muttered.
Moteah joined Rork and Seb at the boulder and quietly stole a look for herself. Her usually uptight expression didn’t show the slightest hint of concern.
“What are they hauling dead bodies for?” Rork asked her in a whisper.
“Why would I know?” Moteah answered.
“Cause your brother’s the one who went scouting.”
“Do I look like Moto to you?”
“Yeah, you do,” said Rork. “If’n he sprouted tits I couldn’t tell you two apart.”
Moteah’s brow tightened even further. This wasn’t anger. Moteah called it ‘severe disinterest’. It was one of her two expressions, the other being plain old disinterest. Problem was, that look wasn’t a good way to deal with a man like Rork. The best thing to do was to pretend not to notice him, even ignore him altogether. Unfortunately for Moteah, she was too young and fresh to get away with that either. To a man like Rork, her wrinkled brow was nothing but shirred meat, and the rest of her was an annoying robe.
“Bitch is leadin’ us into a trap,” he whispered to the others.
“I’m not leading anyone anywhere. Seb is.”
Seb felt the eyes of both these schemers bear down upon her. 
“Don’t lookit me,” she whispered back. “I didn’t set this up.”
They were still looking at her.
Seb pointed east, in the direction of the Junei Plain. “There’s a overhang in the ravine down a ways. It could do as a cave. It could be that the Hrks have taken it up.” 
“Seb, you’re a soilbucket.” Rork’s voice was uncomfortably loud. “This is a goddamned trap if I ever seen one. I bet my uglies they know we’re here.” 
Rork faced the cloud of mist from which they’d come, and he cast his suspicious eye about, as if the dark boulders lurking in the haze were really Hrkan Skulsi in disguise. He unwrapped his tall bow from its cow-leather strap and strung it with an easy flick. The rest of the Ayramun caught on to his excitement, and they strung their bows in kind. Then all thirteen of them, Gugi included, crept up to join Seb, Moteah, and Rork at the lip of the ravine. When their fists were full of arrows, Rork decided that the time was right to strike. He gave his bow a pull to test the string, and then he stood up and loosed an arrow at the unaware wagonmaster.
The arrow didn’t have far to go. Almost as soon as the fletching was free from Rork’s fingers the arrowhead was implanting itself into the back of that Hrkan neck. The man clutched and gurgled, then fell to his knees and splashed down face-first into the budding rainwater stream. Downstream, one of the horses whinnied and stamped when it found its drink suddenly awash with blood.
Rork ducked back behind the boulder and gave Seb a contented grin, like he’d just won the battle all by himself. Then they waited. Moto had said there wouldn’t be a whistle, so they had to wait for the battle straight. They waited for at least a full finger, and by then the rain started to let up and the sound of the ravine’s running water was louder than the plunks which poured from the sky.
Having had enough of waiting, Rork made to climb down into the ravine.
Seb caught the hem of his robe and pulled him back.
“What are you doing?” Seb rasped.
“There’s no one here,” Rork sneered.
“Moto said wait!”
Rork stretched his arms out to gesture at all the nothingness around them. “Wait for what?”
“A signal.”
“Signal to do what? What are we ambushing, horses?”
One of the Ayramun, a young one named Ritt, popped his head up. “There’s Hrks down there somewhere, I feel it.”
“Quiet down!” Moteah snipped.
But much to Moteah’s dismay, and Seb’s amazement, Rork stood straight up and put his finger and his thumb to his lips and whistled out a three-chirp alarm—bright and sharp. The sound cut through the falling mist of rain as easily as if it weren’t there at all. The horse’s ears swiveled as they regarded Rork with some confusion, and before anyone could stop him, Rork scrambled down to the bottom of the ravine, arrow knocked. When his feet slapped onto flat ground, he crouched and waited for something to happen, and when nothing did, he growled a curse and shot an arrow into the back of the already dead Hrk. 
“I’m not stayin’ here no longer,” he said.
With that, Rork marched across the ravine and tossed his bow up onto the other side and started to climb out.
Moteah swept up in Seb’s periphery and shot an arrow right at him.
In clean dry air a gull-feather arrow with a whistling nock would trill with excitement when released, but soggy as it was, Moteah’s arrow flew across the ravine with nary a whine. Rork had no idea what hit him, and it hit him right between the blades, and it burrowed deep to nick the heart. He fell backwards, back into the ravine, and he was limp dead before he even hit the ground.
Seb gasped. It was against the rules to even scratch one of their own, even a throbbing cock like Rork. Killing an Ayramun was a privilege reserved for Ayram.
Before Seb could get out a word, Moteah grabbed her by the breast of her robe and yanked her down behind the boulder. Seb twisted the girl’s hand away and held it firm in her wiry grip.
“What’d ya kill him for!?”
Moteah put her finger to her lips and shushed. Seb grimaced then spat the whole borcandi blob that had been stewing in her cheek. She spat it right at Moteah’s face, but quick as a cat, Moteah ducked out of its terrifying arc and the wad landed with a splat on Gugi’s chest. Gugi squealed in disgust as he flicked the gooey gunk away. Moteah clapped his mouth shut with her free hand and her eyes flared caution at both of them. She pointed with her chin to the opposite bank and mouthed a silent warning—Hrks.
Seb let go of Moteah’s wrist and peered around the boulder. There across the ravine were two shawled figures wandering out of the mist. At first she took them for Ayramun, but the first of them made a foreign gesture towards the other, and when Seb saw a flash of white under one of their ruddy cloaks she knew for sure—these were Hrkan men.
The two figures paused, cocked their heads towards Seb like they’d felt her thoughts ripple the fog between them, and they dropped down flat against the ground.
Seb ducked fast behind her boulder. She turned to Moteah and had to restrain herself from shouting.
“They know!”
The sound was hardly out her mouth when from behind them, on their own safe side of the ravine, a Hrkan horn of war thrilled the air.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommmm

Hrkan battle horns are deep and drooping bleats that tremble the bones of even the most well armored lizards, and Seb was clad in nothing but rags. When the horn blast jumped up behind her it startled her out of her skin. She yelped and swore and swiveled around to face the terror, and there, deep in the fog, running right towards her, was a blurry host of men, Hrkan Skulsi, white coats flashing bright under brown disguises. Maybe twenty or more of them.
They moved in silence, a leggy, white speckled blob, all business, just jogging right up like they were lost and about to ask for the way to the road. They didn’t try to intimidate with screams and yells, for in truth they were killers, not soldiers. The power of the Mazidai had long made armies obsolete, so the kind of professional fighting man that the Hrkan world breeds is one who lusts for the frenzy of small skirmishes where the pain of death is anesthetized in glory whenever man proves himself against man.
The horn bleated again.

BWEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooommmm

The Skulsi blob began to sprint. 
Seb felt a strange warmth running down her thigh and she realized that she’d pissed herself. Moteah loosed an arrow at the running blob and before the girl saw the results, she took off sprinting west, back up along the ravine and towards the mountains. Seb took off after her, and the rest of the Ayramun followed. They trimmed the ravine, pursued by that mob of Hrks, while on the opposite bank those two Hkran cloaks had somehow multiplied into twenty. They shadowed the Ayramun, silent like the others, and they bunched up against the ravine as they waited for the terrain to present an opportunity to close the gap and kill. Seb nocked an arrow mid stride and shot it across, but it flew harmlessly into the mist. Others had more luck—Gugi put an arrow through the leading man’s leg, and the man behind him was struck down when an arrow rammed into the side of his skull. The two figures crumpled to the ground and those behind bumbled over them, but this did little to slow the chase. 
Then Moteah jumped down into the ravine.
Seb wondered what insanity could have possessed the girl to give those Hrkan Skulsi a leaping chance, when in the next instant, a thin, golden beam of Mazidfire came ripping right by her ear.
The line of this blazing fire screamed out in the misty distance, and like a sword it began to swipe. Seb ducked low and avoided its arc, but the men behind her weren’t so lucky. The fire ran right through the back of Gugi’s head and burst out of his eye-socket as if his brains and bone weren’t there. His body slumped down, and the fireline’s distant fulcrum swiveled, sending the beam of death swiping downwards through the air, cutting four Ayramun into uneven halves before smashing into the earth, its tremendous heat sizzling the soggy clay as it went.
Then as suddenly as the Mazidfire came, it was gone, it went roaring into earth, leaving in its wake charred flesh, black glass, glowing stone, and smoke.
Those still alive threw themselves down the ravine’s steep slope. Seb bumped into a karkle bush on the way down and rolled uncontrollably to the bottom where she flopped belly-first onto the muddy ground and slid with a splash into the ravine’s nascent stream. The rest of the Ayramun were already scrambling to their feet and fleeing along after Moteah. Seb stayed put, for there in front of her eyes was the very bush she’d seen that morning—the bush from under which she’d pulled those accursed bones. Its black twigs bloomed above her like a monument to fate. Her mind was unpinned by the significance of it, and she felt that awesome humbling chill which only comes when one catches a glimpse of the divine plan.
She tried to reel back in by telling herself this bush was just a bush—no more or less a major player in the divine plan as the mud squishing against her stomach, or even Ayram himself. Yes, this bush was just a bush.
And yet…
And yet she was supposed to crawl up under that bush and so she did. She crawled up under it, and she lay herself down where those bones had been, and she watched through the brambles as the Hrks descended upon her straggling companions.
Ten of the leaping Hrks were shot down by arrows before their feet landed in the ravine, yet the Skulsi, undaunted, charged on. Their feet flung mud as their powerful strides closed the distance as fast as swept-backs. Seb cowered under the bush lest the obligation of battle came to her. Her gut turned at the sight of one man sticking his boot on the back of her comrade’s head, suffocating him in the mud. But the Ayramun were valiant, and this cruelty was paid in turn with a knife stuck through the gut. 
 Seb could not see much of the battle, but she heard its sounds well enough. Metal clanged, mud-caked fists smacked faces with squelching thumps, sharp elbows cracked against ribs. No doubt that fling of limb and muck was rich with fighting deeds that warranted songs. Side whittled side until a Skulsi gave a gruff shout to stop—there was only one Ayramun left, and the man who shouted claimed the right of single combat. The rest of the Hrks ran off into the fog to search for more pokes to poke.
Seb watched through blurred vision as the last two mud-caked combatants sized each other amongst the smattering of corpses. Both were wounded and breathing hard with blades held out before them. By this point the rain had stopped. Seb felt the itch of purpose stirring in her stomach. Perhaps the bush had reserved her for this very moment, for here was an opportunity for decisive action, and that was all anyone could ever ask for—clarity of cause and effect—the outcome of a skirmish turned with her.
Seb twisted out from under her bush to fire an arrow at the man she took to be a Hrk, but just as she did, two figures stepped up to the lip of the ravine above her. The shorter one opened its mouth and a golden beam of Mazidfire burst out, cutting both combatants in two.
Seb froze in fear at the sight of the Mazid and its Minder. She scuffled back up under her bush.
She had never seen a Mazid before, and she couldn’t see much of it now. It was shorter than its Minder by a good foot, the height of a youth. It was skinny, and its gangly self was wrapped up in blue robes and a blue cowl like a penitent priest. Seb couldn’t see the eyes, only the general gauntness of its face, which was white as sea foam, like the creature had been dipped in cream. Seb squinted to try to get a better look because it didn’t appear to have any hair. Its chin was smooth and hairless as an egg, and its brows were shaven. The Minder was a normal Jandri man, dressed in the standard scribal robes—a richer, brighter blue with a blue hooded cape that blanketed his broad shoulders like a pelt.
Another man joined the two figures up on that bank. Unlike the others, he was a natural born Hrk through and through—blackred hair, greying around the temples, with copper skin and eyebrows so thick they could flog lizard skin. His dark cloak was held together by a silver sunrose brooch—the mark of military command, and underneath this cloak were the white robes of a Skulsi. This captain marched up to the much shorter Mazid, and he bore a look of such contempt that he seemed about to strike.
“Explain yourself!” the captain shouted as he pointed to the two sizzling corpses down in the ravine.
“I don’t know what you mean,” said the Mazid, meekly.
The captain chafed at the Mazid’s play of ignorance. “You killed one of my men.”
“I didn’t know which was which.”
“So you killed both?!” The captain then turned on the Mazid’s Minder. “I don’t know how you people breed these things, but something is wrong. Each one is dumber than the last.”
The Minder had a dark, square face and a patch of hair which crawled underneath his bottom lip, and when he clicked his tongue at the captain, the patch curled, underlining his annoyance. “You preach to the choir,” he said. “You’ve only had to deal with the Mazid for a week, whereas I am bonded to it.”
“You’re half the problem. You’re supposed to control it!”
“This is a difficult breed. The Lords say they’re balancing intelligence with docility, but then they bind me to this Mazid, which is neither intelligent nor amenable to instruction, and when I complain they tell me to bear it like I’ve been trained. So bear it, captain—those are not my words, but the words of the Lords.”
The Skulsi captain looked about ready to strangle them both. The Minder shrugged him off and said to his Mazid, “Apologize to the captain.”
“Apologize!?” the captain fumed. “What use do I have for an apology? Tell me, what can I do with it?”
“You can—”
“Don’t answer!”
The Minder shrugged again. In his right hand was a short rod of wood wrapped in braided leather. He held it up to the captain and said, “You may hit it if you like. It won’t hurt the creature as it doesn’t feel pain, but I find it works out my frustrations nonetheless.”
The captain took the rod firm in hand.
“Avoid the head and neck,” said the Minder. “And obviously, the stomach.”
The captain swung the rod and brought it down hard on the Mazid’s shoulder socket. A smack rang out, and the Mazid’s arm sunk down and went limp, clearly dislocated. Though the blow was brutal, Seb winced more than the Mazid did.
The Captain stepped back to appreciate the bludgeoning. “They don’t make Mazidai like they used to,” he said.
“They don’t.”
“It’s a wonder the Lords make use of these things at all. They’ve long outlived their utility. We Skulsi can handle outlaws on our own.”
The scribal Minder clicked his tongue at this remark. “Captain,” he said with disdain, “the only reason you are dealing with outlaws at all is because outland tribes are too whipped by the Mazidai to become anything more than outlaws. Get rid of my office and my charge, and you might find yourself on the front line of a real battle.”
“What do you mean, a real battle?”
“I meant no disrespect.”
“Sounded like disrespect.”
“I assure you, I meant no disrespect.”
Though Seb could not see well, she could see that the captain was about to explode. Every fiber of his Skulsi discipline was snapping.
The Minder drew his lips tight. “If you’ve something foul to say, then let’s have it out.”
The old captain glowered at both the Minder and the Mazid. “Remember that you are here to make things easier for me, not the other way around. And I’d say that killing my men outright is a violation of that mission. Worthy of censure! If you were not a Minder, I would have had you burned out for incompetency!”
The Minder was unimpressed. “If I were not a Minder you could do all manner of things. But fantasies are the domain of children and beggars, not soldiers who stand up straight. White light, we speak of the decline of the Mazidai, but if you are Hrkan Skulsi then I worry doubly for the Lordship.”
“You have a problem with me?”
“I do. Look at you—pomped up like you deserve something better than what you have, like you don’t understand that I can speak to you how I want. Worry about yourself, captain, lest that self-important stomach growl too loudly and forget the station of its Spark.”
“You’d threaten a captain of the Skulsi!?”
“I would if he threatened a Minder and his Mazid.”
The captain smirked, then put his hands on his hips and eyed the Minder with a gleam of amusement. “I doubt you have the control,” he said. “Just the other day one of my men saw your Mazid let an outland poke run free. It could have easily burned the man down, but it didn’t.”
“That man went free because the Mazid doesn’t control the fire. I do.”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean exactly what I said.”
The captain’s face screwed up as he slowly put two and two together. “Are you saying you killed my man?”
“I didn’t know which was which,” said the Minder as he cracked a sly grin.
The captain’s jaw dropped in shock. “Wait until Lord Gagan hears about this! He’ll have you out in the pastures where you belong, minding sheep not Mazidai!”
The Minder countenanced the captain’s threat with a skeptical brow. Seb could sense the man’s stinging smugness even from beneath her karkle bush. 
Then the Minder said to the Mazid, “Kill that man.”
The Mazid’s throat glowed gold and in a flash its mouth was ablaze with the fire of gods as a thin beam of golden light shot out. A heartbeat later, the captain crumpled to the ground. In the place where his forehead used to be was a black and smoldering hole. What was left of his face was fixed in hurtled surprise.
The Minder grunted in satisfaction before regarding his Mazid with contempt. “Don’t you ever think about what you want or don’t want. You don’t have wants. Get creative with my orders again and I’ll have us both sent back to the guild for—”
His words were interrupted by the act of the Mazid shuffling towards the ravine’s lip. Shock dawned on his face as the creature began to climb down into the ravine.
“What are you doing?” the Minder spat, but the Mazid did not answer. It had reached the ravine’s belly and was walking towards Seb’s bush. It was close enough now that Seb could see its gaunt visage clearly—a ghoul of a person, with silver, empty, Sparkless eyes.
“Stop!” the Minder commanded with a shout. His word shook the Mazid’s spine. It paused, struggled a step, then continued on as if laden with chains.
The Minder stretched out his left arm, which was missing a hand. The stubby wrist wrapped in white cotton and ornamented with golden trinkets affixed in a net of delicate golden chains. He pointed this jangling nub at the Mazid and screamed, “STOP!”
The shout was so strong it had form and purpose, it punched the simpering rain and exploded out to clear a bubble of dry air into existence, flinging the raindrops out of it, sending them spraying over Seb’s bush and the world beyond. Indeed, the shout was so strong that it wrenched Seb’s own Spark in her stomach, and it struck the Mazid with a crippling force, as every single muscle in the creature’s scrawny body snapped taut as if snagged by time. This creature tilted, unbalanced, and when the bubble of rain collapsed and a blanket of water fell, the Mazid fell too, stiff as stone, splashing onto the muddy ground. It landed without much heft, like it was a blanket tossed.
Though it was still against its will, its gray eyes remained unnervingly alert. They swiveled in their sockets and found Seb inside her bush, and Seb lay transfixed. In Seb’s long journeys through the Sand she had looked every manner of creature in the eye, and in each of them she’d found some sort of kinship—not so when she beheld the pale-white, bald, browless, lashless, silver-eyed Mazid.
Her fixation on this creature was broken when the Minder climbed down into the belly of the ravine. This short effort put the man out of breath, and he stood still for a moment before marching over to the Mazid and giving it a probing kick. The Mazid was stiff as a board. The Minder cursed his own luck, then picked the limb-bent creature up, put it upon his shoulder, and began to walk away. He was almost lost in the mist when Seb scrunched out of her bush and drew her boot knife.
 She crept along, making extra sure she didn’t slop too loudly in the muck as she closed the distance to the Minder’s misty figure. Stalking a man with his back turned triggered Seb’s instinct for the hunt, and she matched the Minder’s footfalls and kept herself ready to leap. Excitement swelled when the Minder strolled past the bodies of Rork and the Hrkan wagonmaster, for there were also horses to hide her noise.
She picked up her pace. The first horse eyed her dumbly, oblivious to her murderous pursuit. Soon she was only yards away from the Minder, and when Seb could no longer contain herself, she screamed such a deep and wild scream that it surprised even herself.
The Minder dropped his burden in fright. Seb plunged her knife into the man’s flinching shoulder. She yanked it out and the blade blurred against the back-swinged arc of blood before getting lost altogether as Seb rushed through a flurry of blows. The Minder twisted and fell into the sticky mud. He tried to scramble free, tried to shove aside her fury, but the man had only one good hand. He raised his ornamented forearm to shield his face, but Seb’s knife was there between the golden chains, and it was there again between the ribs, and there in the stomach, and in the neck, then cutting through the bone in his flailing elbow. Seb jabbed at the man’s throat, and jabbed again, and again, and she did not let up until her knife slipped out of her hand from the glut of blood.
A few gratuitous punches later, and the Minder was dead.
Seb sat back on the dead man’s waist and admired the kill. It wasn’t clean, but the struggle had been quick, one-sided, and glorious. Seb admired her ultimate prize, the pale Mazid, who lay limp in the mud behind. Its eyes were stilled and its body was dead, as it was no longer bound to any will. The sight of it settled Seb into the realization that she’d succeeded where all the other Ayramun had failed, and an exultant cheer welled up in her stomach. She made to let loose victory, but her shout was chilled by the sight of a short, irascible pillar of black rags standing only a few yards away.
It was the old witch Elrahet.
Some unseemly witchness had swept the woman down from her mountain cave, and there she stood in the mist. Her dark eyes quested the muddy ground, ignoring Seb and her glory. She followed some unseen trail towards the Hrkan wagon, and she hobbled over to it. Once there, she used her gnarled cane to prod at the body which had fallen out of the wagon’s bed.
Seb quickly gathered herself up, and the limp Mazid as well, and hustled over to the witch to show off her prize. She held the Mazid’s body out as an offering, expecting praise, but Elrahet merely glanced and nodded. She was more concerned with the dead Jandri youth at her feet and the wagon itself, which was packed to the boards with more dead Jandri youths. They’d been crammed inside the bed like poached pigs. Elrahet knocked one of their dangling arms with her cane and said, in her sneering way, “The Amalgamete has outgrown its suckling chin.”
The sight of so many bodies unsettled Seb’s stomach, even though she herself was coated in mud and the blood of a man she had just stabbed to pieces.
“They’re not dead,” Elrahet said scornfully. “I can smell their Sparks, cursed to the flesh. Look.” The dead boy at her feet was half-slipped from his white tunic, revealing his legs and uglies. Elrahet poked him in the stomach with her cane to drag the tunic further up, revealing a raspberry ring of darkness welling up under the skin and circling his belly-button.
“He was meant for food,” Elrahet said.
“Food?” Seb asked.
“Food for the Amalgamete. We’ve not caught our Mazid a moment too soon, for the beast is grown enough to eat.”
“You sure?”
Elrahet sneered at the implication that she could possibly be wrong. “Give me the Mazid,” the Old witch snipped.
Seb lay the Mazid’s blanket-weight on the witch’s stooped shoulder.
“And you take the boy.”
“What?” Seb asked.
“Pick up the boy and carry him.”
“Why?”
Elrahet did not answer, for she never answered a question like, ‘why’. ‘Why’ was asked of people who could not see the threads of purpose which weave a certain future. Elrahet could see them. It was rumored that she’d weaved some of them herself.
Elrahet waddled away, down the ravine. Her wet rags dragged behind and scraped the mud, leaving a slug-like trail behind as she bore the Mazid into the mist.
Seb picked up the skinny boy and followed. </Text>

            <Title>Burgeon Theft</Title>
            <Text>Mandri tried on three separate occasions to finagle some burgeons out of Seb. He was denied each time, and each time Seb grew angrier. She got so mad that she threatened to kill Mandri, and when that didn’t work, she threatened to kill the burgeons. 
Then a small miracle occurred.
One night Seb found the corpse of a beautiful blue butterfly. This butterfly had fluttered out into a place where no butterfly should be. Seb claimed it was a sign of the divine, and in digging around her pack’s interior to find a suitable case for it, she pulled out a woolen blanket, and in so doing, unwittingly pulled out her pouch of burgeons as well. The pouch hit the sand and out popped three beautiful God’s Eye burgeons. Two of them spiraled harmlessly in little circles, but one burgeon hit the ground rolling as if flicked towards Mandri’s toes by Solraheen Himself.
Mandri covered it up with his foot. When Seb finally noticed that her burgeons had spilled, she snatched them up, quick as a fox, none the wiser that she’d missed one.
Mandri smiled.
The feeling of that burgeon under his heel was brighter than the moon and stars in the sky, which was quite bright. Yes, the world was blue and comfortable, if a little cold.
When Seb stomped off, he pocketed the burgeon. He wouldn’t use now, for these were prime walking hours. It would be better to save that blessed burgeon juice for the droll, daylight hours. He would ride contentment for as long as it lasted. 
He passed by distant dunes that had dark streaks running down their faces. Obo called them weeping dunes. Large weeping dunes. The dark lines were streaks of water seeping out onto the surface. Obo said that he’d seen dead bodies of men at the feet of weeping dunes. They’d been trying to sop their dried tongues on the damp sand. He called it the cruelest thing—the water is there but you can’t drink it. You’ll only get a mouthful of sand.

            <Title>Pain</Title>
            <Text>One religion is True and the rest are False. This categorization satisfies most, but some people aren’t content with a simple dichotomy so they continue to divide the world’s religions through a rigorous analysis of the similarities and differences of belief and behavior.
Solitants come specially prepared for battle in this arena. When they proselytize to the fractured, they open with the observation that every religion in existence turns on a story that explains the origin of suffering. The Supine Cult believes that there are two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter. The Bavainu believe that suffering is a result of one’s own evil acts, or one’s ancestors. The Shell Kings believe that suffering is a symptom of Shellkhashar, which is a kind of spiritual, transmittable disease which dulls virtuous instinct. There are a hundred more religions, each with a hundred variations, and in every instance, the story of suffering’s arrival is accompanied by a solution for it. The Supine Cult entreats their followers to lay down and pray their energy into the sky to make it stronger, for that is where the righteous god dwells. The Bavainu say that if one lives rightly and follows their ancient law, their life will be a happy one. The Shell Kings recommend drinking the blood of a willing virgin mixed with a mind melting toxin found in a sea snail’s shell. Every religion has its own solution to suffering. That’s a category, religions peddling relief—and all religions belong to it, all of them except for Solitantcy.
The Solitants offer no solution to life’s troubles. &quot;We’re the only ones who believe that suffering is not something to fear,&quot; a Solitant priest will say. &quot;Suffering is what this is all about!&quot;
He or she then smiles, and the smile accentuates the self-inflicted scar on their cheek which marks the rite of initiation into Solitant orders. Those Solitants who have delved deep into the mysteries smile underneath a mask of scars.
&quot;Life is suffering&quot;, they say. &quot;Try to suffer without suffering.&quot; They laugh because it doesn’t make sense. Truly, the Divine Spark is like a block of sculptor's stone. It is clean, abstract, inert, featureless—and then comes the sculptor's chisel. As the chisel carves away at the stone to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the person. What troubles our fleshy vessels is what makes us who we are. In this way, Solitants are artists of the Self and their chisel is pain. Solraheen guides the hammer.
Typical Hrkan speech has only the one word for pain. If a person says, “I am in pain,” there’s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe, or did a loved one die? Have their bowels been blocked for days? The word ‘pain’ can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are using the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The words ‘anguish’, ‘ache’, ‘soreness’, ‘irritation’, and ‘misery’ all approach different things, but they’re not nearly enough to cover the spectrum. In casual use they’re ill-defined notions, substitutable, a fuzzy cloud orbiting pain.
The Solitant goes as far as to claim that the very structure of Hrkan speech stunts the growth of pain appreciation, as the mind cannot develop a sensitivity to certain flavors of agony if the world is divided into subject, verb, and object. Such a structure separates the Self from the action, and in so doing, grand vistas of becoming remain hidden from sight.
The keyturn comes after reflecting on the sentence, ‘I hurt myself.’
I
Hurt
Myself.
Notice how language has smuggled in a narrative. It has conjured out of nothing an ‘I’ from before and a ‘myself’ after the act of hurt. It has split the Self in two, which is impossible. It has reduced ‘hurt’ to simple phase transition. Solitants find this framing limiting, and so they invented a tenseless, subjectless language revolving around pain and its effects. Outside looking in, this language is more of a catalog of rasping utterances than a functional language, but Solitants claim it has utility nonetheless.
Mandri was perfectly fine with the phrase ‘I hurt myself’. Hurting himself was the primary means he’d acquired hurt. He suspected that it was the same for everyone else. There was no need to deconstruct something so universal. There definitely wasn’t any point in creating a whole new language to discover the subtleties of pain, because pain was best expressed through the natural language of gesture, as Solraheen intended. In breadth of expression, the face is far, far superior to words. Of what use is a fuzzy word when one can see the pain written on the face clear as day?
Observe the eye and brow of a person in pain—is there languor, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience, anxiety? Is the skin knit tight, is it smooth, is it beaded with sweat? Is the eye’s lid puffy or hollow? Are the cheeks wet or dry, dark or pale, sallowing brown, or purple, or yellow? Then there’s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up into the face. The lower back knots up, the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, and finally the lips draw tight and the teeth gnash. A trained eye can look at another in pain and know, without words, the entirety of their inner world. The holy language of the Solitants is redundant, and no argument could convince Mandri otherwise, that is, until a demon bit his thigh.
Pain woke him from his fainting spell, a pain so intense that the slightest pressure elicited a scream. The skin around the already clotted wound was taut and throbbing, a drumhead reverberating pain. Moto tried to make him walk, but that was impossible, so Moto carried him. Chopper tossed Mandri atop Moto’s pack, and with each step that the man took, Mandri’s raw wound chafed against a shoulder, sending a fresh wave of excruciating pain into his groin and hip.
Mandri fainted again.
He woke up the next day when Moto leaned back and dropped him from a height like a camel dropping dung. Mandri landed hard on his wounded thigh and he let loose a gargled curse. He tried to find some twist of hip and spine that could give relief, and these contortions ended with him lying all the way back and shifting most of his weight onto his right ass cheek. Here, Mandri’s reeling mind found the space to understand that he was still alive.
He could breathe.
He was not dead. 
Damn it all.
Through the chewed-up hole in his robe he could see that his affected left thigh had been poulticed and bandaged, though it was poorly done, even by his severed-hand standards. The brown woolen wraps were ragged and splitting apart. A few sturdy threads were all that was holding the mass of spongy, mud-dusted weeds together. 
He looked up and saw that the reason Moto dropped him was because they’d arrived at some accursed destination—an enormous black rock sitting in the middle of a flat and barren sandy landscape.
Mandri was astonished by the sight of it. It wasn’t just any big rock, it was a single, smooth, uncracked rock. Rocks that big in the Sand tend to look like old, slumping things that have been half-melted by the sun, but this rock, this biggest of all boulders, was a healthy, upright egg. So unnatural and precarious was its position that it seemed a strong blast of wind should be able to pick the whole thing up and send it rolling along the desert floor. Mandri felt that if he stood next to it and gave a hearty push, he could get it rolling. 
Sitting as it was in an empty desert landscape, with no other rocky eminence in sight, well, that made it seem like the rock had been deliberately placed there by the hand of Solraheen. Surely, it was a holy site.
Moto was stooped over a big pile of the Ayramun’s haulings some yards away. There were only two other Ayramun present, two dour looking men who milled about that pack heap. Moto unstrapped his own pack and tossed it on top of the others.
“What are you two doing?” he demanded of the two.
“We been looking for you,” said one of them, a Zosan whose only distinguishing feature was a polished brass hoop wrapped tight around his neck.
“Looks to me like you've been doing nothing,” Moto replied. 
“We got told to look for you, and here we are, lookin right at you.”
Moto nodded towards Mandri and said, “Well, now you can look at him. Make sure he doesn’t go and do something stupid.”
“How about we take you to Ayram, as we been ordered to do?”
Moto looked back at Mandri, who wasn’t going anywhere. He then shrugged and said, “Lead on.”
The three men walked off towards the giant black rock. They walked around it, and then disappeared.
Mandri wasn’t concerned about being left behind. He was busy twisting himself around to try and undo the searing knot of pain that throbbed inside his thigh and hip. He did finally find some meager relief by sticking his hand under his right ass cheek and leaning on it.
He decided that he well and truly hated Moto. This was more than the flippant hate he doled out to everyone and no one in particular. He tried to recall the words to an Old Jandri curse that could kill a callous man like Moto, but the pain in his leg was a powerful amnestic.
He set about preparing the ground around him so that he could more comfortably wallow in it. Eventually, he decided to shimmy over to the pile of packs so that he could use it as a prop, and as soon as he did, something on the other side of the pile groaned.
Mandri dragged himself closer to get a better look. He was careful not to disrupt the tenuous peace he’d negotiated between himself and the wound in his thigh. As soon as the pain flared up he stopped moving altogether. He nestled up against the pile and settled his elbow into a bag of grain. He let his hip sink gently into an inside-out goat bladder stuffed with who knows what. 
The groan he’d heard came from a lump of dusty black rags that sat a few yards away from the pile. They were Mazidobo’s rags, and the lump they covered was the right size for a legless Mazid.
Mandri felt around for something to poke Obo with. His searching fingers settled on an empty waterskin. He threw it at Obo, and the limp waterskin flapped harmlessly into the sand.
“I know you’re there,” Mandri said.
He waited, but no response came.
Mandri dug around in the pile for something else to throw. He was so tickled by all the little outland trinkets, stone beads and thumbstick idols of gods he didn’t know, that he almost didn’t register the dull, snapping crack of bone as Obo’s black rags twitched then went silent.
“You okay?” he asked the rags, but again, there was no answer.
Mandri pulled a tight ball of twine out of the pile. He tossed it underhand, and when it landed on that pile of rags they sighed. Another crack of bone sounded out, and the rags twitched again, but this time Obo’s jerking loosed a strap of robe to reveal his pale shoulder. Mandri watched, half in terror, half in curiosity as Obo’s pale and hairless head emerged from that mass of tattered robes.
“Hello, Mandri.”
Obo suddenly sat up, and his robes fell away to reveal a scrawny, bruised, and broken body. Mandri had seen awful sights, but watching this pale Mazid fix a dislocated rib was something else entirely. And judging by the sorry state of his robes, and the bloody abrasions splotching his shoulders, he hadn’t been carried through the desert like Mandri, he’d been dragged along its floor. 
Despite all the abuse, Obo’s mood was ordinary. He stretched his arms and what was left of his legs as if he were a cat waking up from a nap. He even twisted around to draw out the kinks of his spine, and this stretch popped every one of his vertebrae in rapid succession, causing Mandri’s own spine to stiffen in sympathetic fright, a sudden jerk that unleashed a fresh wave of torture radiating out of his thigh.
He yelped.
Obo smiled like a beerbat.
“What are you smiling at?” Mandri asked.
“I’m happy to have some company that doesn’t want to ruin me.”
Obo took up his robes in his mouth and scooted himself closer to the pile of the Ayramun’s packs, and as he leaned himself up against them, he caught Mandri staring at his stumped legs, which had been stuck into canvas sacks.
Obo spat out his robe and covered himself up as if it were a blanket.
“You should save that anxious look for yourself,” he said. “I smell death on you.”
Mandri looked down at his missing hand and his poorly poulticed leg. “I think I made it through the worst of it.”
“Doesn’t look that way to me.”
“Last night I could hardly breathe, but now I can breathe just fine.”
“What happened?”
“You wouldn’t believe me.”
“I might.”
“I was bit by a demon.”
“A demon?”
“I said you wouldn’t believe me.”
“Are you sure it wasn’t some strange species of lizard?”
“I’m sure. It was a demon.”
“When you first saw me, you thought I was a demon.”
“This was different.”
“As may be, but I think it’s worth appreciating that there is always a distinction between what you see, and your interpretation of what you see.”
Mandri winced hard as the pain in his leg reared.
“You should let me look at the wound,” said Obo.
“Why?”
“I may be able to do something for the pain. I won’t know for sure unless I see it first.”
Despite Obo’s calm and generally amicable demeanor, there was no getting past the fact that Obo looked like a creature who wriggled around in caves. The absence of eyebrows, those signposts of the Spark, made it impossible to ascertain the intentions hidden behind his shine-silver eyes. 
But the pain in Mandri’s leg was stupid, and Mandri couldn’t think of many things worse than something stupid that refuses to go away, so he huffed and puffed and rolled himself over to where Obo sat. Once he made himself as comfortable as he could be, he scrunched up the hem of his robe to reveal the bite, and that’s when fear took hold of him.
The many veins in his inner thigh ran black as ink, and nearer to the loose poultice above his knee, those black veins were bulging above his skin like nightworms.
“Sol’s light,” Mandri muttered.
He gingerly unwrapped the long strip of wool that held the poultice in place. The various weedy leaves and lichens that composed the meat were too dried out to be doing any good, and he was able to flick most of it into his open palm easily enough, but the rest he had to pluck, for the pulped leaf stems closer to the flesh were caked in a gooey dark-brown emulsion of infected blood and poultice paste.
“Try to clean it up,” said Obo.
“What do you think I’m doing?”
Mandri kept picking until all that was left was the terrifying sight of a day-old demon bite. The edges of this fang-scalloped wound were festering and black, and this jagged ring of necrotic flesh enclosed a puddle of that brown emulsion, which had, in parts, been scraped away to reveal the red-raw muscle of his thigh.
Opening the wound to the air reinvigorated the pain. Still, it looked worse than it felt. What really got Mandri worried was how his inky black veins spidered up his thigh and in towards his crotch.
“Let’s see the full extent of it”, Obo said as he leaned over the affected area.
“No. I don’t want to know what my uglies look like.”
“How does your chest feel?
“Just hurry up and do what you’re gonna do.”
Obo studied the wound with an impassive gaze, eyes darting from detail to detail, as if he were a dealer appraising a painting, and the particular texture and color of the budding scab could help him determine authenticity.
“Hurry up,” said Mandri.
Obo pulled back and said flatly, “I can’t do anything for you.”
“What?”
“That is the strangest bite wound I’ve ever seen. I’m half inclined to believe your story.”
“You said you could help with the pain.”
“Did I?”
“Don’t tell me you lied.”
“A Mazid never lies.”
“Bullshit, I bet you lie all the time.” Mandri slapped the weedy poultice back onto his wound, and he did his best to re-roll that ragged strip of wool around it.
“Do you know what this place is?” Mandri asked, nodding towards the giant black rock.
“I overheard one of our captors call it Minting Rock.”
“Wonder why it’s called that.”
“The name suggests it’s a place for these bandits to mint counterfeit coins away from prying eyes. But I’ve seen such places before, and this one is different.”
“How so?”
“Most illegal mints are hidden near a natural spring. There is no spring here, so far as I can tell. And this rock, it’s too conspicuous to be a mere bandit’s den. It possesses a numinous beauty.”
“If it were blacker, I’d call it a boulder of Fabled Black.” Mandri dabbed his finger against the black veins running up his thigh. That was a mistake, for the pain it kicked up was severe.
Obo ignored his wincing and said, “I would say it’s a holy site, but these Ayramun are too crude for it.”
“Especially Moto,” Mandri hissed between breaths of pain. “The man is an ass. The man is a donkey wearing human skin.”
“My admittedly limited impression of him was that he was one of the smarter ones.”
Mandri sighed and tried to distract himself by stealing a small bag of spicy jerked beef from the mound of things. He popped one of these slips of meat into his mouth, and he tucked it into his cheek to let its flavors fix him.
“Moto’s not smart,” he said. “Speaks well enough, but that doesn’t mean anything. He’s as dumb as the rest of them.”
“They’re not so bad.”
“You’re wrong. They’re cruel. Look at what they’ve done to you.”
“I don’t know,” said Obo, wiggling his stumps under his rags. “I think that Ayram was right to do what he did, from his point of view.”
Mandri was waiting for a sarcastic wink but it never came.
“He chopped off your legs,” Mandri said bitterly.
“And I’m thankful he showed such restraint.”
Still no wink.
Mandri chewed the jerky because he would scream from the pain in his leg if he didn’t. “You’ll never be able to walk again,” he said.
“Should I be angry about that?”
“Yes! You should! I’m angry for you. I tell you what, I’ll hate the Ayramun for the both of us. They deserve it for what they’ve done to me—and you.”
“I thought a demon did that to you.”
“If that ass Moto didn’t tie me up and throw me into a lizard pit, I never would have been bit. He’s half-demon himself.”
“It could be worse. If you’d been caught up by Kalemites, you’d have been eaten, and the one to consume your stomach would today be wearing your sacrum strapped onto his forehead.”
“I would have preferred that,” Mandri said with a wry grin.
“Maybe,” said Obo, dryly. “But the pain will pass, one way or another.”
Mandri disagreed, but kept it to himself. He stole another slip of beef and tucked the rest back where he’d found it. He set the beef on top of his tongue, and he savored the unfamiliar blend of spices. Some strange pepper in it, and a heap of salt. He was getting thirsty now. He’d like some water.
“Mandri, why don’t you hate me?”
The question caught Mandri off-guard and he nearly swallowed his slip.
“What?”
“Every Minder I’ve ever had has hated me.”
“Who says I don’t?”
“I do.”
“Well you’re wrong about that too.”
“You can’t lie to me about this, because I literally feel your moods.”
Mandri licked his fingers. “Well if you really want, I could hate you a little bit.”
“No, I was hoping we could be friends.”
Mandri laughed, but Obo’s face was serious.
“Friends?”
“Yes.”
“Well,” said Mandri, “A little hatred won’t get in the way of a good friendship. Friendship doesn’t actually require us to like each other.”
“I was under the impression that it did.”
“Wrong again.”
“I thought the purpose of friendship was to make life less miserable.”
“That’s one way of putting it,” Mandri said as reoriented his hip to soothe a pang of pain in his thigh. “Put another way, friendship is something people do to pass the time. We don’t actually need to like each other to do that.”
“I see,” said Obo, disappointed. “I would disagree, but I can’t challenge your own experiences with my own as I have none to share.”
That was such a sad way of stating loneliness, that Mandri actually felt a little bad for the Mazid. “The Hrks treat you like a slave, don’t they?”
“I’d say we Mazydai are treated worse than slaves.”
“Well, believe me, friendship—true friendship like you’re thinking of—it doesn’t exist. Like if it’s too much trouble for me to help you out, I won’t. Don’t look so glum, it goes both ways. We can call it something else. Acquaintances is a word we could use.”
“You didn’t answer my original question.”
“Oh. What was it?”
“Why don’t you hate me?”
“Obo, I never made a conscious decision about it. Maybe I do hate you. I don’t know. I will eventually. Two people get to know each other well enough, and they start to hate each other—I’ve seen it play out a thousand times.”
“If you think that I’m a person that you can get to know, then you’re already the nicest person I’ve ever met.”
“Please, Obo, you’re laying it on way too thick.”
Obo tried to look confused, but without eyebrows he just looked constipated. “What does that mean, ‘laying it on thick’?”
“You might be able to fool these outland pokes, but I’m a different breed.”
“I still don’t know what you mean.”
“Let’s see—you obviously don’t feel pain. You don’t seem to feel anger, and I very much doubt you feel compassion. You said you want your freedom, and you had your legs chopped off to stop you from ever trying to run away. I’m not dumb, Obo, you’re not talking to me right now because you want a friend. What you want is a pair of legs to help you run away. You can’t exactly go running off into the Sand, but I can. And I’m your Minder—who better for it?”
“You can run on that leg?”
“Well, no. But I’m not wrong.”
“You must be the most skeptical creature that ever breathed a thought.”
“Am I wrong?”
“You are. I do feel compassion. You only suspect I don’t because I can guard my emotions. I can choose whether or not to express them.”
“If you were capable of compassion, I wouldn’t have seen a Mazid kill a hundred-score in a heartbeat.”
“When?”
“The massacre of Gudrk.”
“Gudrk was two hundred years ago.”
“I saw it in a painting.”
“Of course,” said Obo, scoffing.
“But am I wrong? You say you never lie, so answer me that—am I wrong?”
“Wrong about what?”
“That the only reason you’re talking to me is because you want to use me for whatever escape you’re scheming up.”
Obo paused to consider his words carefully.
“It’s a simple yes or no,” Mandri nudged.
Obo tilted his head back and forth as if to weigh some heavy decision. He finally muttered, “How should I say this...”
“By saying yes, or no.”
“I am talking to you because I wish to explore the potential of our relationship.”
“Uh-huh.”
“I have no plans.”
“Now that is a lie.”
“I have no plans yet,” said Obo with a mischievous grin. “First I have to discover what that giant wants with me.”
“Isn’t it obvious?”
“It is not.”
“He said he wants you to kill a great demon.”
“I very much doubt there is some unheard of demon king hiding out in the Sand. If there is, and a Mazid could kill it, then Hrk could deal with the problem as easily as Ayram. The Lords hatch a new Mazid every other year. Ayram’s quest, as stated, is unnecessary.”
“So then what does he want, then?”
“The obvious answer is that he wants what every other outland man and woman wants, and that’s to destroy the Hrkan world.”
“That doesn’t seem possible.”
“It isn’t.”
“And why involve me? Why didn’t Ayram make himself Minder?”
“I suspect he didn’t want to lose his hand. I also suspect he wants to outlive the year. Minders don’t live very long once they’re bonded.”
“Wait, what?”
“You didn’t know? ”
“Know what?”
“Once bonded to a Mazid, a Minder’s life can be measured in—”
Suddenly, Obo’s attention shifted towards Minting Rock. Mandri followed his alarmed gaze, and saw nothing, only the rock itself. But Obo could hear things, and perhaps see things that nobody else could. Mandri tried to discern if the news was good or bad by studying Obo’s face as the Mazid strained his preternatural senses, but his eye barely twitched. Obo gave nothing away unless he wanted to. 
“The stage is set,” Obo finally said. “We will have to hold this discussion.”
Obo stuffed the hem of his tattered robe into his mouth and stump-shuffled back to the spot where he lay before. He plopped down flat and covered himself back up with his black tatters so that it looked like he’d never moved at all.
He gave Mandi one last whisper, and the breath of his voice fluffed the folds covering his mouth. “Pretend that we never spoke.”
“Yeah, I gathered that.”
Then there came a loud, finger-mouth whistle from the direction of Minting Rock, bright as a bright-beak’s call. A heartbeat later, and people began to tumble out from around Minting Rock’s belly. First one, then three, then seven of them, and last came Ayram. Each in turn took off jogging towards Mandri and the pile of dumped goods. They looked like they were fleeing before a marauding giant.
The first to reach him was the short, boorish man named Hill. Hill pushed Mandri over, casually ignoring Mandri’s agonized hoot. He picked up the pack that Mandri had been laying against, and he gave Mandri the most disapproving look as he trotted back towards Minting Rock. The rest did much the same. Ayram was the only one to stay. He stood right over Mandri and his great big head and round loaf beard blotted out the sun.
Such was the man’s size that Mandri felt humbled, and humbling Mandri was no easy feat. No matter how intelligent or beautiful someone seemed, it could never erase the fact that they were only human—impulsive and excitable. Self-interested. Mandri, buried in Ayram’s shadow, looked up and saw all the familiar features of a man but did not match the pattern as a person. Ayram was greater, somehow more solid, a reference point for being, like an old tree or a father in the eyes of a son.
“Moto!” Ayram shouted. “Get over here!”
Moto was one of the Ayramun who’d been scrambling around, hauling all those packs towards Minting Rock. He was hugging a bulging sack of sand-dried vegetables when he heard Ayram shout his name. He immediately dropped the sack and jogged over to see what the fuss was about.
Mandri was pleased to see that his thigh had left a swipe-stain of his own blood on the shoulder of Moto’s otherwise speckless garb. A small victory, but a victory.
“Explain,” Ayram said as he pointed to Mandri’s leg.
“It’s as I said. The boy got bit by a demon.”
“In the thigh?”
“He was trying to run away from me and he jumped into a lizard pit.”
“No I didn’t,” Mandri countered, his own voice sounding whiny even to him.
“Explain why this boy was running away from you.”
Moto shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as if he hadn’t the faintest idea. Ayram glared at the man, clearly expecting an answer, so Moto cooked up some bullshit about Mandri trying to escape. His whole body got involved as he told his false story. Mandri was familiar with the technique. All that gesticulating, it wasn’t really about selling the lie, it was about Moto letting Ayram know that he was going to cause a fuss if he was called out on the lie, and if Ayram thought that fuss would be more trouble then the whole thing was worth, Moto might just get away with it. 
Moto finished by extending his arms all the way out to the sky and declared, “The boy’s an idiot! He doesn’t think. He’s got a dull Spark. You should have seen it, the demon was chewing on his leg and he didn’t even try to fight the thing off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.”
Mandri knew he couldn’t speak out of turn so he was forced to resort to an incredulous gasp, and with each word that Moto spoke, Mandrameen’s face scrunched up tighter and tighter—he made every effort short of squealing to let Ayram know that Moto was lying.
“You didn’t do what I told you to do,” Ayram finally said. 
“How could I?” Moto griped. “It’d take twelve virgins to liven this one up! The boy has no will to live.”
“Take the Mazid,” Ayram growled.
Moto walked slowly and deliberately to where Obo lay, picked him up, tucked him under the arm, and then took off towards Minting Rock, sending back a threatening glare for Mandri before he left.
 Ayram tapped out his frustration against his elbows as he stared at Mandri’s leg.
“It was an ill omen, finding you dead in the hills. It took my witch a whole hand to convince me that your Spark was worth rekindling. When a man is brought back from the dead, sometimes, he comes back changed, corrupted…agents of Shis. Is that what you are?”
The mention of Shis triggered in Mandri the memory of Salavan’s hidden basement. He tried to block all thoughts of that black painting out of his mind because he felt that Ayram’s wild eyes were reading his thoughts.
“Can you walk?”
“I can try.”
Mandri rolled onto his stomach and pushed himself up onto his good knee, and from there, he stood up. His bad leg was as stiff as a board, though he was determined to walk on his own for he knew it would not go well for him if he couldn’t carry his own weight.
He took a step and shuddered.
“I don’t think I can walk, but I might be able to hobble.”
Ayram nodded. “Make your way into the rock.” He reached down and grabbed Mandri’s left arm, and his gigantic fingers encircled the bicep a whole half over. 
“It is good that you try to walk. An evil man would make himself a burden.”
With Mandri steadied, Ayram let go,  and moved to retrieve the last items from the Ayramun’s pile. Then set off stomping back towards Minting Rock, leaving Mandri and the desert to themselves.
Mandri hopped a few steps, but his left leg still couldn’t bear even the slightest weight. It felt like his thigh bone had splintered, and every shuffling hop sent white shards of bone stabbing into the meat of his thigh.
But it was not a great distance, so he soldiered on.
As he went he thought of the Solitants and their sacred tortures. He wondered if they had a word for the particular arc of sensations that a demon bite inflicts. He wondered what this pain would do to him, what kind of man it would make him if he toughed it out.
He looked out over the empty Sand and recalled a heretical painting titled, ‘Oneness with the Divine’. It depicted a flayed Solitant lying on a rack, his skin completely unwrapped from his body, his bare anatomy exposed to the haze of incense floating around a dark room. This mortification was a ritual performed by only the most schismatic of adherents, men and women who did not want to craft the Self, but tried instead to destroy it. This particular ritual was an attempt to confront the Self with the truth that there was no edge between it and the rest of reality. The logic was as crude as the operation—removing the skin removes the Self’s final boundary. There is nothing left to contain it.
But no doubt the ecstasy depicted in that Solitant's face was put there by the artist. It was not possible that a person could remain conscious through such an ordeal. And Mandri refused to accept that a ritual flensing could lead a person to righteousness. What kind of world would he be living in if that were true? Such a place could only be called Shis.
He made it into the shadow of Minting Rock and pressed his hand against the rock’s cold belly. He pushed as hard as he could. He didn’t expect to be able to push it over, but he had to satisfy his curiosity. It really did seem that if he stood there long enough, a strong wind would blow and the rock would roll over and squish him like a bug. 
Cut into the earth at the base of the rock a hole that looked far too much like a giant drag-belly den. As there was no other way but down, he hitched on. This dark and cramped tunnel soon led him into a dead end of undressed stone stacked haphazardly like an old goatherd's fence. Above him, high up, was a circle of daylight. It seemed as if he were at the bottom of a dried-up well that had been carved all the way through the core of Minting Rock itself.
From above, a voice shouted, “Grab the rope!”
Mandri fumbled about in the darkness and his hand stumbled upon a rope. He took several deep breaths to battle the pain, then he held on tight as he was hauled up into the stomach of Minting Rock.</Text>

            <Title>Epilogue</Title>
            <Text>No one spoke as they fled through the dark tunnels of the world. At least, Mandri never heard anyone speak. If Moteah or Moto gave voice to some practical concern, he wasn’t aware of it, for all his senses seemed so far away. He could not feel his feet squeeze inside his shoes as he ran. His palm did not tingle when he braced himself against cold and clammy stone. He was a passenger inside his own body. His own breathing seemed like someone else’s. It took tremendous effort to reassert his Self and swivel his eyes to study the iridescent threads of purpose which guided him through the dark. It was so much effort that he did it once and never again. He was content to follow wherever those threads led. And of course, it led him upwards, towards the world’s surface. Mandri’s only worries were the suspicious stares from Moto and Moteah. He thought they gripped their swords a little too tightly. 
Eventually, his purpose led him to a small, shit-stained hole that some lizards had hewn. He belly crawled through it and emerged into the night of the desert. The twinkling sky was a magnificent blue and the clean air was invigorating. He stood up, brushed off the grit which clung to his sleeves, chest, and knees, and then he closed his eyes and took a deep, neck-stretched breath. The soreness and exhaustion his body was experiencing would have bulled him over if he weren’t dwelling in his own periphery. Then he opened his eyes and found himself standing atop a plateau in the Goree mountains. 
To the south he spied the distant silhouette of the temple Shulgi set against the blue of night. He could blot it out with his thumb.
To the west was the sand blanketed world. The Tib blacked the rim of the horizon.
“Out of the way,” Moto grumbled as he pulled himself out of the hole. When he was all the way out and standing, he took a deep breath, just as Mandri had done.
“I’ll light a fire,” he said.
Long stalks of woody haggas weed grew out of stone-cracks nearby, and Moto gathered these while Mandri pulled Moteah’s pack out through the hole. When Moteah was out and standing, she was quick to snatch her pack back from him. 
She was wary of him. Mandri desperately wanted to laugh, but somehow, he couldn’t. He simply stood there, staring at her Spark like a freak, and he stood like this until Moto built a respectable fire. Once the flames were crackling, Moto permitted them all to sit.
Moteah retrieved from her pack a rare treat—two small bricks of cappash, which was a dried and minced lizard meat spiced with bitter herbs and caked in yellowed fat. She handed one of these to Mandri and said, “You look like you need it.”
Whatever force controlling Mandri’s body accepted the offering. He nibbled on a corner, thinking there’d be no taste—he couldn’t feel the weight of his own body, much less the saliva in his mouth. And at first there was no taste, but with the second chew, the meat’s musty flavor percolated into being. Somehow the act of eating was pulling him back into his own skin. Every swallow slumped him further and further into his body’s exhaustion. 
“Sol’s light, I’m tired,” he mumbled between mouthfuls. “I don’t suppose we could take some time to sleep?”
“No sleep,” said Moto, who wasn’t eating anything. He was sitting cross-legged, hunched, appreciating the fire between them. His sword sat gleaming in his lap. “We need to talk.”
Mandri licked his teeth and said, “I know.”
Of where to begin.
“Do you know my story, Mandri?”
“I’ve already told him,” Moteah said.
“He knows that an Amalgamete killed our people?”
She nodded.
Moto had his hands up now, as if to frame the significance of what he was about to say. 
“Mandri, I saw you do some things that were not wise. And I saw that evil witch…she said some things that were concerning. Then you went and drank from her stomach. Mandri, she called you the Amalgamete.”
He paused to make sure that Mandri understood what he was implying.
Mandri did. “If you want to kill me,” he said, “I would understand.”
Moto’s lips drew tight and he nodded, a tacit admittance of his obvious desire. He said to his sister, “Don’t look at me like that.” She was looking at him like he’d already cut Mandri down. “This could be it,” he said. “Kill him and we could be done. Evil would be gone and dead for good.”
Moteah narrowed her eyes. “We don’t know what Solraheen has planned for him.”
“Solraheen is dead.”
“But so is Schisol,” Moteah countered. “And so is the Amalgamete.”
Moto gripped his knees, and he shook his head for the burden of having to explain was almost too much. “Mandri is the Amalgamete. He killed Elrahet. He swallowed Sparks. We’ll be next. Then the world.”
Moteah did not deny him. She looked to Mandri, stern as ever, a clear demand that he should defend himself.
“I didn’t kill Elrahet,” Mandri said.
“Oh?” said Moto. “So she stabbed herself with your sword, is that it?”
“No.”
Moto snorted his annoyance. “Mandri, I’m going to kill you. You’re going to need to answer to the best of your ability. Mighty words. Do you understand?”
“All I can say is the truth. Elrahet could see the future. She could see her own death. If she wanted to stop it, she would have.”
Moto scoffed at this suggestion. “Elrahet wanted to die? A woman who lived a hundred ages wanted to die?”
When Mandri didn’t answer, Moto leaned forward and put more force into his question. “What reason would she have for letting you of all people kill her? She outlived the gods. She fought off kings of demons and men, but you are the one to fulfill her purpose?”
Mandri’s voice always found his arguments as easily as a swordsman’s fingers found their sword, but at present, his tongue was fumbling. And to make matters worse, the more he thought about who Elrahet was and why she did what she did, the more he was squeezed back into his body’s periphery. The last thing he felt as he slipped out of his face was a warm vibration in his cheeks, and then a snap of cold ran through him.
Moteah’s eyes lit up, and excitement lifted her cheeks. “Elrahet would have seen what her own death would bring. Think about it—the last Amalgamete is dead, and so is Schisol’s shadow. Elrahet must have seen this end and accepted it.”
Moto eyed his sister with slack-jawed disbelief. “Did you not see that evil bitch cut out her own stomach? She could see the future too, couldn’t she? Why would she do such a thing if she couldn’t see how it would end?”
His question hung in the air unanswered, and when he saw that Mandri would never answer, he stood up and brandished his sword. Moteah pulled on his robe as he swept by her. She said, “What if he isn’t the Amalgamete, and that evil witch only said that he was to get you to kill him? What if he’s here to bring good?”
Moto stopped cold and considered this complication. But he sneered his way through it and pushed his sister aside to step towards Mandri. He swipe-flicked his blade through the air to remember its weight, and he set its edge to Mandri’s neck.
“Give me a reason not to kill you,” he snarled.
Mandri spoke, and his own voice frightened him, for it was not him who was speaking. The sound was his, and the cadence too, but the force of the words were someone else’s.
“I can see the future, too,” he said as he stared into the soft glow of Moto’s Spark. “I see threads of purpose. They have always run in front of our Selves so that the gods might weave our purpose, but the gods are dead. Our purpose now, is ours alone. This is what Elrahet wanted. This is what Solraheen wanted.”
“They want me to let you live?”
“No,” Mandri said calmly. “They want you to be free to do what you want—nothing more or less.”
“And what of the evil witch whose Spark you swallowed?” The edge in Moto’s voice was as sharp as his blade. 
It did not bother Mandri.
“She wants the same as the others,” he said. “They all want you to do what you want. Elrahet believes you will want what is right, Pel thinks she knows you better.”
Moto sneered at the implication that he was in any way predictable. No one could know which way his sword would cut except for him. And it seemed for a moment that he might strike back.
But Moto would not kill Mandrameen.
This did not mean that Moto did not want to do it. It was clear from his unwavering gaze and firmly planted feet that he did. But in the breath before he delivered his final stroke of judgment, a paralyzing uncertainty dumbed his features and stayed his hand. Mandri saw a thin thread of purpose drawing Moto’s sword away.
Moto clenched his teeth and hissed.
Mandri watched with fascination as Moto struggled against the most merciless of uncertainties—uncertainty of consequence—that bane of progress, that womb of fear. A single cup of this uncertainty could dissolve the resolve of an entire nation. 
Kill Mandri, and Moto might save or doom the world in equal measure. Or, Mandri could be of no consequence at all.
Who was he to know?
The turmoil played on Moto’s face, and his dropped guard let Mandri see his true Self clearly, for floating inside that fear of consequence was mercy and compassion, the signs of a Spark yearning to understand and be understood. 
Moto stepped back and sheathed his sword. “Come, Moteah. We’re leaving.”
This simple command shattered Mandri’s equanimity more than the threat of death, for in slipped the fear of being left alone. Mandri knew that if he were left alone in this vast expanse that his Self would blur beyond all hope for reassembly. And with Mandrameen lost, what would he become? Even now, a presence pulled at the veil behind his eyes, and it clutched at his throat. He was forced to clench his gut to squeeze out a single word, a word which he had never said and thought he never would.
“Help.”
Moto’s skepticism was cold.
Moteah’s empathy was warm. 
Both their Sparks were near and infinitely separate.
Mandri wanted to draw them closer.
He wanted to keep them apart.
He smiled at the thought that he could mean such different things to different people, and he sobbed at the realization that all he was, and all he’d ever been, was that very difference.
He begged them both to stay, for he could never be lost so long as someone else was present. And in the end, they agreed, though Moto was sure to add, “We’ll think better in the sun.” So, they waited for the sun to rise and bring the fresh white light of day. Maybe then they would know what to do.</Text>

He thought about cooking a nice, meaty, white-tail soup.
He was running through the dark, fleeing from the sight of hunting demons, and he was thinking about soup. He’d never cooked a white-tail soup before in his life. He’d never even thought about it. Maybe he had in passing, but it was never something that he couldn’t get past. His mind’s eye was filled with a vision of flaky white meat spiced with bitter herbs, all swimming in a creamy yellow broth.</Notes>

            <Text>Purl offered Mandri a snack of binks. A bink was a yellow nut the size of a tooth, with black spots on either end. They were quite bitter. Mandri preferred the bland hardtack. Purl said that binks were better for him than hardtack because they had healing properties. She said that there were mice living in the Sand that, if he could believe it, subsisted entirely on binks. It gets them through the severest droughts. She once had a pet mouse and was careful to never let it drink. It lived on a diet of binks until the mousey old age of two. Mandri doubted the story, but he did not do so out loud, as earlier that day he’d seen her lagging behind the others looking like she was about to give up and die—feet dragging, head sagging, sobbing, nursing her injured arm like it were a dying cat. Elrahet and Moteah were there, walking in front of her, seemingly oblivious to the grief streaming down Purl’s face, or perhaps they had been the cause and didn’t care. Whatever the story, Mandri was careful around the girl because she had enough to deal with.</Text>

Unusual for Mandri.
He told Obo about it, because by now they were sharing most thoughts with each other, and Obo claimed that the Hrkan hardtack Mandri was eating was mixed with succor of salt. Succor of salt is an anaphrodisiac, it curbs the libido. He said that the Hrkan Lords don’t want their troops rubbing uglies when they’ve got more important things to do.
Mandri resolved to eat no more of the hardtack, but changed his mind when Obo forced him to consider the alternative—he’d be out here in the Sand, his lust pounding away, his uglies alert, with no real way to find release.</Text>

At last, Mandri was as red as the rest of them.</Text>

            <Title>Charnel Road</Title>
            <Text>Mandri was hauled out of the pit cave on a knotted rope. Once out on the surface, he got his first real look at the Sand’s Pitted Portion. He’d seen paintings of it, as any time a person wants to bring the magic of the wider world into their home they order the standard eight-piece polyptych of the Sand’s Eight Portions, and when it came to the Pitted Portion, the painting was more or less the same every time—a view from high up in the western Hias looking down at landscape of barren rock dotted with large pits like the one he’d just been pulled out of. In Hrkan eyes, it was a land in which to sweep the spall of battered nations.
It turns out, those paintings were lies, for laid out before Mandri was an ordinary desert plain, with stands of green scrub-brush battling against stands of pink-flowered browngrass, with splotches of barren rock here and there acting as a no man’s land between these warring tribes. And so far as Mandri could see, there was only one other pit about a hundred yards to the north. There might have been more of them, but he didn’t have time to find out because Tob plopped a heavy, knobby sack onto his shoulder and told him he had to carry it.
The heat of the afternoon sun was sweltering, and Mandri’s legs were still deeply sore. His mind was the only part of him in full working order, and that was no good because a sober and alert Mandrameen was a complainer. Two gruff men walked alongside him, and one of them smelled like a festering sore. The other man was Moto, the Zosan who’d helped chop off Obo’s legs. 
Mandri had spent a lot of effort trying to get away from people like Moto. He’d tried running away to be a farmer. He’d tried losing himself in burgeons. He even tried dying. Yet here he was, meandering through the Pitted Portion, far enough out in the wilderness to wonder if anyone had ever stepped foot on this spot of earth before, and there was Moto, striding alongside, a good and well-adjusted person. Mandri hated well-adjusted people. They were too judgy. Mandri could tell, just by looking at Moto, that the man judged people based on appearances alone. 
And damn it, the man was handsome, with sharp, even features and a chiseled jaw. Goodly height, broad shoulders, and his bird-bright eyes looked out at the world like it was all a game and people were toys. Even when standing still the man was dynamic. Standing still, he looked exactly like a heroic statue of Zos, a swerve of coiled strength. And his color was an exact match in shade to the color of Zos’s painted skin—two parts umber, one part Wazian blue. To top it off, his garb was disgustingly fashionable, with his orange robe tucked and folded along the chest into a series of inverted triangles that accentuated the athletic V of his torso. Such considerations, set against the struggle for survival out in the Sand, was rude. It was rude to look so healthy. Moto even had a sword with a gold plated hilt.
Yes, it was clear that Moto was well-adjusted, and in Mandri’s eyes, being well-adjusted to this hateful world was a clear sign of derangement.
Eventually, Mandri lagged behind on account of his abiding weakness. Moto dropped back with him. The two were walking side by side around bush and bramble. Mandri wondered aloud where they were going. Moto said that they were following the road. 
This didn’t answer Mandri’s question, so he asked, “The road?”
Moto laughed. “You can’t see the road?” Then he laughed again. His was an arrogant laugh. It started with a twinge of annoyed disbelief and ended in a derisive smirk.
The thing was, Mandri did see the road. They were walking along the gentlest raised hump of earth which snaked away into the infinite distance, a slope so slight and obscured by brush that, sure, it was easy to miss, or easy to mistake for a natural drift of dirt, but Mandri saw it.
“You don’t know about charnel roads?” Moto asked.
Mandri knew about charnel roads but he didn’t want to engage the man. He kept his eyes down and tried to look like he was too miserable to talk, which was easy to do because it was mostly true. He clutched his handless wrist against his chest to play up his condition, but Moto didn’t care.
“This is the Bazul Road,” Moto said grandly. “The whole Sand is full of charnel roads just like this one.” He kicked the ground and scattered some loose stones, as if doing so made the road’s existence more believable. “You don’t see it because it’s so overgrown.” 
“Must be.”
“It is…it is…So look, I’m going to ask you some questions, and I want you to answer them truthfully and to the best of your ability.”
Mandri said, “Alright,” and was hopeful about it, because he wanted to get some information in return.
“Who are you?” Moto asked.
“I am Mandrameen. People call me Mandri.”
“I said answer the question to the best of your ability. Was that the best answer you could give?”
Mandri reflexively smiled to soothe Moto’s hostile demeanor. It didn’t work. 
“Well,” said Mandri, “Usually when people ask that question they’re asking for a name.”
“Usually people don’t preface a question by telling you to answer it to the best of your ability. So, I’ll ask again—who are you?”
“My name is Mandri, and I was a farmer, and before that I was a painter.”
“A painter?”
“Yes.”
“Interesting…but that makes sense…your type tend to be…ill-adjusted. A perfect choice for food for the Amalgamete. I interrupted. Go on.”
“I guess I like burgeons.”
“I could tell that much by looking at you.”
“How?”
“Tell me, Mandri, did you seek out the Amalgamete?”
“No. I don’t even know what it is. The last thing I remember, I was being killed.”
“Killed where?”
“In Meskalim.”
“Meskalim…”
The mention of Meskalim seemed to confirm one of Moto’s suspicions. “So you were chosen. And why do you think you were chosen to be served to the Amalgamete? Give it some thought.”
“I really don’t know.”
“I said give it some thought.”
“I can give it all the thought I want, it won’t help. I honestly have no idea what’s going on.”
“Stop,” Moto commanded, pulling on Mandri’s shoulder-slung sack to force compliance. “You been brought back to life,” he said, “But whether or not you stay that way is going to depend upon how you answer my questions. Notice that I put emphasis on the word ‘how’. I’m talking about respect. Be thorough. And don’t lie.” Moto frowned in great disappointment, as if he already knew Mandri wasn’t going to do any of these things. “The Sand is big, but there’s no room for a lying boy who can’t do the one thing he’s supposed to be able to do.”
&quot;And what’s that, exactly?” Mandri asked. His indignation was livening him up. If he wasn’t careful, he might do something regrettable.
“Ayram already explained your purpose to you. If you don’t like it, I could have you put right back where you were found.”
“I was fine where I was.”
“Really? You’re fine with being fed to the stomach of demons?”
“Never tried it before, so I can’t say for sure.”
Moto stepped back in shock and hissed. Mandri knew it was taboo to joke about anything as dark as a demon, especially out in the Sand, but he wasn’t joking. Well, he was joking, but there was a kernel of honest truth hidden inside that fake offhand remark, and that was enough to set Moto on edge. And it was strange that Moto should pick up on it, as it was unusual for a well-adjusted person to see a playful stab at despair for what it was. Usually, it goes right over their head.
“Start walking,” Moto commanded, and they both set off again, shoes and boots stomping along the charnel road. But it was different now, Moto had become a different person, more serious and bothered. He eyed Mandri though a worrisome squint. “That kind of talk is how I can tell you’re a burgeon biter,” he said. “They all get thrown out into the Sand eventually. Sometimes Ayram takes them up, but it’s always a mistake because a burgeon biter’s mind is too…it’s too short-sighted. They can’t think about the future. Do you follow me?”
Mandri said, “Yes” to try and stave off any further explication, but Moto went ahead anyways.
“I believe you when you say you think you’re better off being food. You don’t fear death, because how could you? Death is in the future and you’ve got no conception of that. You may think that’s all well and fine, because who wants to be living in fear of death, and you’re right, but see, it’s not the being dead that you’ve got to be afraid of—it’s the act of dying.”
The more Moto spoke, the more he was getting wrapped up in his own words, and he was using his hands to do it. He spoke with his hands and his shoulders as much as his mouth, though the heavy pack bouncing around was a mild impairment.
“You died once already, but it couldn’t have been bad because your body isn’t broken. I assume you were strangled. Am I right? That’s one of the easiest ways a man can go. But you’re out in the Sand now, and I don’t think you appreciate the implication of that. This road we’re standing on, you see it's this hump here—”, Moto traced the gentle contour of the road’s hump with an open hand. “It goes on further than you’d think is possible. The Bazul Road. One of the charnel roads. You know what a charnel road is?”
“They’re sacred roads.”
Moto grunted and spat. “A road can’t be sacred any more than a rock can.”
“That’s not what a Solitant would say.”
“Solitants don’t know shit. If they knew what it was like to die on a charnel road, they wouldn’t walk them. If you knew, you’d be kissing my feet. Believe me, Mandri, you don’t want to end up like one of those pilgrims. They walk charnel roads just for the chance to rot on them, and let me tell you, that’s not all that happens to them.”
“I thought the point of walking a road was to get to where you’re going.”
“Oh, that’s not why Pilgrims walk the road. Go and ask a pilgrim why he doesn’t make the Bazul Road in the comfort of a caravan and he’ll tell you that if Bazul did not intend for him to suffer, then Bazul wouldn’t have allowed himself to be martyred out in the Sand—he would have been killed on some oated knoll near clean waters. Bazul’s shrine is set deep into the Sand because that’s the journey Bazul had in mind for his people. In a way, the road itself is the shrine.”
“Ah,” Mandri mumbled. It was a disinterested ‘ah’, and if Moto were a considerate person, sensitive to conversational cues, an utterance like that would have him clam up. 
“They think that walking the road is a test of faith against the power of the sun, and to skip that test is the same as having no faith at all. True Solitant pilgrims don’t trivialize the road by riding in a wagon or walking it at night. They walk the road in the heat of the day, and they die doing it.”
“Tragic.”
“Show some respect.”
“Sorry.”
“Don’t say sorry when you don’t mean it. If you don’t take your own words seriously, then I know you’re not taking mine seriously. You need to be serious, Mandri. Every Minder I’ve ever met was serious.”
“How many have you met?”
“Doesn’t matter. You know, I’m of half a mind to leave you here and let the sun finish you off. It’s not a good death. You ever seen a waterless man with a black tongue the size of a hermit slug? I don’t think you have. Imagine rubbing your eyes with no moisture in them. Imagine an ache that splits you from your head down to your toes. That kind of thirst, it feels like your stomach is peeling apart, like the marrow in your bones is boiling. The worst part is when your mouth dries out, it turns black and the tongue swells up to bursting.”
“Sounds horrible.”
“Haven’t got to the worst of it. There’s an old pile of pilgrim’s bones not far from here that I could show you. And when you see them you’ll see how they’re scattered about and are missing a few limbs. That’s because drag-bellys got to him. Takes a while for a pack of drag-bellys to eat a man full, and when you’re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you’ll still be alive when they do it.”
“I get it.”
“I do not think that you do,” Moto said. “Drag bellies don’t wait for you to die, they just start chewing. And a drag-belly’s venom stings worse than fire. It pulps the flesh. It’ll make your thighs look like brains and your brains look like spit. They got a hundred little teeth like needles.”
He then punched Mandri in the shoulder, dead-armed him. Mandri gasped and winced.
“Whatever pain you’re feeling now, it’ll be that times a hundred. And that’s when you learn how clever a drag-belly can be, because they won’t bite you in the neck or somewhere serious. They know how to keep you alive as long as possible to keep the meat fresh, like they been trained by demons.”
“Look,” said Mandri, pleading. “I’m sorry I joked about being food for a demon. I’m not evil or anything, I’m just tired. So if you could, leave me alone. Please.”
“No, you’re not getting out of this,” Moto said sharply. “Not even dying is getting you out of this. See, I’m talking about pain, Mandri. And I know what you’re thinking—well you’re not thinking it yet, but you will be—you’re thinking you can just kill yourself out here before anything too painful happens, but you’re not thinking, thinking. I once left a boy like you half-buried in a mudpan near Fleet. Ask yourself, why I would do a thing like that.”
Moto paused, as if to give Mandri a chance to answer, but the man couldn’t help himself and as soon as Mandri opened his mouth, Moto charged on ahead, the tenor of his voice growing firmer with every step, as if all of this was well rehearsed and he was just now getting into his favorite part.
“You want a hint? I’ll just tell you. It’s because if you can keep a man from bending at the waist then he can’t bash his own brains in. I once made the mistake of tying a man’s hands and ankles and nothing else, and you know what he did when he got bit by a red-backed drag-belly? He got down on his knees like a priest…then he bent back, face to the heavens like he’s rapt in prayer…that’s what I thought he was doing…maybe he was…and then—WHAM—he swung forward and smashed his head against a rock. Cracked his skull like a spider web.”
As Moto said all this, he imitated the action, headbutting the air.
“I don’t know how many times I can say this,” said Mandri, “But I’m sorry if I offended you in—.”
“Oh, I don’t care about that anymore. We’ll put that off to the side for now. What’s more important is that you said you were fine with dying, so now my job is curing you of that illusion. See, you’re supposed to be a Minder, but you aren’t because you’ve got a dull Spark. But I know how to cure it. I know just what you need.”
“And what is that?”
“It’s not burgeons, that’s for damn sure.”
Moto then called out to the two of the nearest Ayramun, who were a little ways ahead of them.
Moto called out, “Hey! Chopper!”
Both men stopped and turned around. The bald one on the right was Chopper. Chopper’s backpack was so big that he looked like a pack animal, his silhouette a bloated blob of burlap plopped atop two stick-skinny legs.
“Chop!?” He shouted back.
Moto simply beckoned him with a wave, and chopper came running. When he arrived, he looked at Mandri with thirsty eyes and asked, “Chop?”
Moto laughed, “No, no. But maybe. Follow, and you may get to chop something.”
Chopper nodded, and Moto led the three of them off the hump of the road and into the unsullied expanse of the Pitted Portion. 
Mandri mulled his options. Moto seemed serious about teaching him a lesson, and since Moto was a well-adjusted man this probably involved doing harm. But there was nowhere to run—well, there was everywhere to run, but nowhere he could get to without Moto getting to him first. He was completely at Moto’s mercy.
He didn’t have to wonder how far they’d be walking because some few hundred yards away there was an outcrop of several round black rocks which looked unmistakably like a giant gore beetle, only each rock was the size of an ox. One round, smooth boulder was the beetle’s body, and next to it was a slightly smaller boulder that looked like an upturned thorn—the beetle’s horned head. Ringing around the base of these beetle looking rocks were several lizard pits. They were more like shallow pans than pits—drag-bellies aren’t very industrious creatures—and knocked into the base each pan was a single, egg-shaped hole.
There were no lizards in sight. That didn’t mean they weren’t there. Mandri supposed they were hiding in their dens because when Moto led Mandri to one of the larger pits, he did so with anxious excitement. He crept up to it like the knee-deep crater might suddenly erupt.
Once at the pit’s edge, both Moto and Chopper unsettled their heavy packs, and Mandri unshouldered his meager one, and he let it drop without much care for what was in it.
“It’s time,” said Moto as he pulled a body’s length of rope from his pack. “In order for you to join us in the land of the living, you first have to care about what happens to your own skin. But you’re a burgeon biter, you don’t care about anything. What got you biting burgeons in the first place? Are you your uglies limp? Can’t get a girl?”
“No.”
“It was a girl, wasn’t it? Hold out your arms.”
“It wasn’t a girl.”
Moto began to wrap a figure eight of rope around Mandri’s elbows. He was careful not to disturb the ruined wrist. He said, “A boy your age gets upset and jumps into burgeons, it’s always over a girl.”
“Believe what you want.”
“A man’s got to have a reason to be upset. Chopper gets upset when you don’t let him chop.”
Chopper, who had been waiting patiently this whole time, perked up at the mention of his favorite word.
“Chop?”
“No chop,” said Moto.
Chopper’s shoulders sank.
“You see?” said Moto. “Sadness is cause and effect.”
“I’m not sad.”
“You’re right, you’re not sad, that’s not the right word—the right word is…is…” Moto looked up at the empty sky searching for inspiration. “I could never find the correct word for what you are, probably because it hasn’t been made yet. What you are has somehow escaped the notice of every poet who ever lived. But I know what you are because I used to be like you. That’s why you should count yourself lucky to have stumbled into me. I’m the one person in this whole wide world who knows how to fix you.”
Moto motioned to Chopper, but Chopper was too busy salivating at the sight of the too-long length of rope left after Moto had tied Mandri’s arms together.
“Chop?” asked Chopper.
“No chop,” said Moto. “I want you to hold the boy down.”
Chopper, sullen, marched over and forced Mandri onto his ass. Mandri struggled a little, confused as to what, precisely, Chopper’s herks and jerks were trying to achieve. But damned, the little bald man was strong.
Moto pulled out another length of rope and said, “If you make this difficult, I’m going to have Chopper take your uglies. You understand? Nod if you understand.”
Moto’s face was serious. Mandri nodded. Moto then set about tying Mandri’s ankles together. That’s when Mandri noticed movement down in the lizard pit. A wide, shovel-like lizard snout hovered out of the dark den entrance. It licked the air with a yellow, split-leaf tongue, and before it could get in a second scenting, another snout appeared. The two lizards jostled for position, then the newcomer got feisty and started a hissing argument. It then lurched and bit the first lizard in the neck. A seething brawl erupted, and two lizards disappeared back into the den, scratching and clawing for the right to chew on whatever was lurking outside.
The brawl ended in a wild screeching hiss of pain, and the winner stuck its wide, froggish head out into the air. Its yellow, swiveling eyes worked over the three men, then settled on Mandri as though it knew he was the weakest.
Moto tied the knot around Mandri’s ankles tight, so tight that the ankle bones were bruising each other. Moto then stood up straight and observed his handiwork with approval. 
“I need to prime you for what you’re about to experience, so…”
He paused, as if uncertain of what to say.
“I’m going to ask you a question, and I want you to think very carefully about it. I want you to treat this question as if it were a newborn baby, like you’re holding a newborn for the first time, you understand?”
Mandri nodded. 
“Alright. Here it is—why did Solraheen create human beings?”
“What?”
“Why did Solraheen create us?”
“I’m not Solraheen.”
“Did I say to blurt out the first thing that came to mind? I said think about it.”
The drag-belly was now half-way out of its den. Its squat forearms were pushing it up as high as it could, so that its head could stretch up towards Mandri and taste his odor.
Mandri said, “It might help if you told me what this has to do with that lizard.”
“What I’m doing is giving you a problem to solve—and that’s a hint to the answer of my question. Think about it—what is our purpose? Birds can fly, fish can swim, what can humans do better than any other creature?”
“I don’t know.”
Moto bent down, hands on knees, so that his face was close to Mandri’s. He said, eyes bright, “I can see the way you look at that lizard. You fear it. That drag-belly is a problem, isn’t it? It’s a problem. It’s here in the present and you can’t ignore it. You’re thinking about what you’re going to do when I throw you in that pit. That’s what we do better than any other creature. You understand?”
“What are you talking about?”
Mandri truly had no idea. The lizard’s snout was getting close to the rim.
Moto stood back up, he stood straight and proud, and declared, “The answer is problem solving! That’s what Solraheen made us for—we were made to solve problems. Birds were made to fly, fish were made to swim, and you and I were made to solve problems. Not just any problems, practical problems. That’s what we do. Now, you take a fish out of water, and what happens? It dies. You clip a bird’s wings and what happens? It becomes sad and helpless. And if a man has no problems to solve, what happens to him? Don’t answer, the answer is obvious. So that’s what’s wrong with you, Mandri. To make things worse, you’ve filled your belly with burgeons, and when you do that, you lose the ability to identify problems in the first place. So if you can’t even see them, then obviously, you’ve got no problems to solve! You’re a man without purpose! Do you understand?”
“Untie me,” Mandri demanded. He was done with whatever this was, because that lizard was getting close, and it was almost as big as he was. Its tongue was close to licking his thigh. But Moto just stood there.
Mandri tried to scoot away from the pit, but Moto’s foot stopped him.
“Here’s what I’m going to do,” said Moto. “I’m going to pick you up and put you into a problem. I’m going to toss you into this pit with that drag-belly. Your instincts will kick in, and you’re going to try to get out of the situation—you’re going to try to solve the problem. Because that’s what a man is supposed to do.”
“How am I going to fight off a lizard if my hands and legs are tied?”
“Don’t worry about that, Mandri. I mean, you should worry about that, but what I mean is, you’re going to be alright in the end. If you throw a bird off a cliff, what’s it going to do? It’s going to fly. You’re going to be flying before you know it.”
“If you tie up a bird’s wings, it’s not going to fly.”
Moto waved Mandri’s point out of the air, as if it were nonsense, then gave Mandri’s hip a kick, and Mandri rolled down into the pit. His sudden tumbling startled the drag-belly, and the big lizard spun around and scurried back into its hole.
“You got about half a finger before that lizard finds the courage to come back out.”
Mandri stared at the black hole, eyes as wide as the moon.
“Alright,” said Moto. “Think about what you need to do. Assess your options.”
The drag-belly emerged once again from its den. Its fat head weaved side to side, its tongue warily tasting the air.
“You gotta hurry,” Moto said excitedly.
The lizard was a lumbering dolt. Its whole body swayed back and forth, giving Mandri a good view of its eponymous belly drag. Soon it was upon him, its tongue flicked against his thigh, and its head kept swinging back and forth as if to savor the wonder of this free and easy meal.
But before the lizard could do anything, a loud bump sounded out of the lizard hole, and something inside grabbed the drag-belly’s tail and yanked the whole beast, hissing and clawing, back into the dark. 
“Oh-Hoooo!” Moto thundered. “You ever seen a drag-belly queen, Mandri? She’s got to be twice the size of that bastard you just saw. This will be good!” 
Mandri stared into that drag-belly den, and yes he felt a little motivating fear, but he wasn’t about to give Moto the satisfaction of fighting back. He’d died once before, and by god, he’d do it again.
He rolled himself over closer to the den.
“What in the White Light are you doing?”
Mandri smirked. “I’m solving a problem.”
He rolled over to face the dark den and meet his final fate. He peered into those shadows expecting to see the maw of a magnificent creature, but the head that moved in those depths looked like a man’s.
“What the—”
Suddenly, two scaly gray arms with taloned hands burst out of the hole and grabbed Mandri around his ankles. Mandri yelped in fright as he was pulled into the den.
“Shit!” Moto exclaimed as he hopped down into the pit.
Mandri was yanked down further and further until his hips plugged up the entrance. Whatever frightening beast was pulling him down crawled up on top of his legs, and Mandri screamed as it set its long black talons to work in widening the den’s entrance.
Mandri wriggled and tried to free himself, but stopped when a searing pain exploded out of his thigh, just above his left knee. He could actually feel a vise of fangs scratch his bone. 
“AGH! It bit me!”
Moto grabbed Mandri under the arms, and began to pull. In response, the creature loosed its bite and caught Mandri’s ankles again.
A furious tug of war ensued until Chopper joined the struggle, and the two men heaved with all their frenzied might. Out came Mandri, but those greedy gray hands still gripped his ankles tight. 
Human hands with lizard skin and claws.
With another strained heave, Moto and Chopper pulled Mandri free and the beast’s snarling head burst forth into the light.
Its visage was a sight undreamed of, the product of some unholy miscegenation between man and drag-belly lizard. Its round skull was crested in bony ornaments, its lips were draped in tuberculate scales, and its tongue, White Light, its long split tongue was flicking out of a mouth filled with hungry, sharpened teeth. Its eyes bulged out of its head—two round black-slitted yellow orbs looking in different directions, and when it blinked, its wet, scaly eyelids squeezed those eyes back into their sockets, and when the blink was over they popped right out again.
“Chopper, quick!” Moto shouted as he pulled Mandri free of the pit. “Chop it!”
Chopper pulled from out of his robes a silver axe with an axe-head that looked like a hand. He shouted a joyous, furious, “CHOP!”, and the lizard-man-thing shouted back a gargling hiss of swinging spit that flew out of a wide pink throat, a throat that was studded all the way back with teeth
 The two leaped at each other.
Chopper was faster.
His axe slammed right into the creature’s bulging eye.
The beast squealed in pain and it tore itself out from under Chopper’s pinning blow. Chopper then chased it back towards the den, and the beast disappeared, scrambling down while screeching.
Moto easily untied the knot around Mandri’s wrists by pulling on a loose bit of rope, and he undid the knot around the ankles with similar ease. He used one length of rope to improvise a tourniquet high up on Mandri’s left thigh, above where the creature had bitten it. He used a nearby stick as a windlass to twist it tight, and he twisted it so tight that the pressure was almost as painful as a wound.
“What was that!?” Mandri wailed.
Moto locked the tourniquet in place with a sturdy knot, then sat down to catch his breath. 
“What did it look like? It was a demon.”
“What!?”
“Don’t act all aggrieved with me. You didn’t even try to move out the way. You stiffened up. You rolled towards it.”
Mandri would have shrieked at the man, but the pain in his leg was several times more severe than his anger.
“Ah! God!”
“You got yourself bit by a demon, Mandri. It’s going to hurt. It’s going to do more than hurt.”
“It hurts!”
“That’s what I said.”
Moto stood up and brushed himself off. He looked around, glanced to the distant east, as if someone would be there to help. Then he sighed, set his hands on his hips, and eyed Mandri’s wound.
“This is some real shit you’ve made.”
Mandri rolled on his side to try and flee the tortuous pain, but that somehow made it worse.
“Sol help me!”
“Yeah, well, all we got is Chopper.”
“Chop?” Chopper asked, staring at Mandri’s leg.
Moto snorted a laugh.
“I wish,” he said. “Oh, how I wish. Help me pick him up.”
Chopper jogged over, reached down, and the moment he touched Mandri’s demon-bitten thigh to lift him up, a searing pain shot through Mandri’s whole body and he fainted.</Text>

            <Title>Minting Rock</Title>
            <Text>Before the rise of the Hrks, the Fertile Portion was ruled by an Old Jandri king named Duror. To prove his dominion, Duror placed interlocking blocks of granite two-by-two-by-ten at every bend of the Jek river. Out of these gray columns he carved his long-bearded, long-robed, menacing image. The first statue was built at the Jek’s source, high up in the Goree mountains overlooking the Shoglok falls. This statue was sanded so smooth by the erosion of ages that no discernible feature of Duror remains. He is little more than a gray wither of stone in the general shape of a man, earless and eyeless, a brooding pillar that watches the sun, moon, and stars spin endlessly overhead.
The Jek river descends down into the foothills where it is guarded by a spate of statued Durors that are sanded smooth as well. They’re pointed pillars, more like cattle scratch posts than filigreed statues of a king. Their heads are conical nubs, their swords are worn down to the hilt, and reed boats float by them unbothered. Then the river pours out of the foothills and meanders down into the brink of Hrkan civilization. There the statues of Duror were somewhat shielded from the erosive wind, though they were not able to hide from the chisels of recriminate outland men. Once inside Hrk proper, their component blocks begin to disappear altogether as the stones are stolen to reinforce pastoral walls. When the river arrives at the outskirts of Jeket, all that is left of Duror’s monuments are the enormous plinths upon which they once stood, for they are too large for anyone to bother with.
Old Jandri statues disintegrate the nearer they come to Jeket—the symbolism here is obvious, unsubtle, and pointed, and so of course people disagree about what it means. A Hrkan Lord would say that it is a sign of Hrk’s cleansing influence on the old world, while outland folk see it as a sign of Hrk’s corrupting influence. Outland folk yearn for that storied age when all peoples were rootless, when herds of oxen were free to be chased across the entire continent, when women wove blankets so long they could be wrapped around a village, and when men were honest and would cut off their own fingers to prove that they were sorry.
Both sides, Hrkan and Outland, claim the statues of Duror as symbols of their own magnificence. Sometimes they kill over them. A bunch of nonsense, Mandri thought. Everyone involved was an idiot. The pivotal detail that no one cared to notice was that most of these statues were sitting alone out in an empty desert because the course of the river Jek had changed dramatically over the centuries. The statues have nothing to do with Hrk and whether it was good or bad. Their message is that nothing lasts forever, and while Mandri was sure about everything, he was most sure about that.
Rivers change their course.
Rivers dry up.
Continents dry up.
Everything living dies.
Solraheen Himself was killed and buried. 
Beauty fades.
Paintings brown up and curl.
Hands get cut off.
Statues turn to dust.
Everything living dies—that’s worth mentioning twice.
Ideas are easy to kill—some might try and argue that one, but Mandri could easily slip into saying that ideas are easy to corrupt, and no one could argue that.
Innocence is famously easy to kill. In fact, it seems that is the main function of innocence, to be killed.
Manhood is easy to kill because it doesn’t exist in the first place. Same with womanhood, adulthood, and any-hood. They’re all hoods foisted upon a child who never quite grows up. And children? Schisol knows children are easy to kill.
Minting Rock was another object to add to this collection of things consigned to oblivion. Its central sunlit well was drilled straight through the rock’s core and down a ways into the earth. Mandri was pulled up through it on a knotted rope by some out of sight Ayramun. He looked up as he ascended, for far above was a beautiful, canted column of light that split the blackness. He was smitten with that Spark-shushing awe which only comes from contact with a soon to be-extinguished culture.
It was impressive. He felt, without exaggeration, that he was inside the eye of a bead cast off from the necklace of a primordial mountain god. If it weren’t for the pain in his leg, and the difficulty in staying on the knot with only one hand and one effective foot, he would have had a spiritual experience.
He ascended into the first room, which was a bulbous, cylindrical cocoon eight men tall. The light above did little to illuminate the interior, it was lit instead by two flower-flame oil lamps affixed to either shoulder of a giant’s-height passage to Mandri’s left. It was a dim, splayed, orange light, and so much of the room’s detail was lost to blackness, but what Mandri could see took his breath away.
The flat disc of a floor was embossed with a rotationally symmetric diamond pattern, and at the floor’s edges this pattern ran smoothly up onto the wall, such that there was no distinction between where the floor ended and where the wall began. The pattern flowed upwards and split into several ribbons of sculptural stone, a weave that criss-crossed in and out of itself, a stunning fantasy that coupled geometric intricacy with organic fluidity and pulse—all in stone. And it had dimension, as the topmost ribbons cast hard, shifting shadows on the ribbons underneath. It seemed as if the room were a cage keeping out a kaleidoscopic vision stolen from a burgeon binge and brought to life. And that topmost layer, the bars of this cage, graduated from a swirl of ribbon at the floor into a prickling fence of barbed thorns towards the ceiling, and like climbing vines they spiraled all the way up this bulge of a room and converged towards the center of the ceiling, merging into the lashes of an oval eye whose iris was the open shaft which led ever upwards and into the light of day.
The room smelled like a urinal. And before this smell could truly sour Mandri’s experience, an unseen hand grabbed a fistful of Mandri’s robe between his shoulder blades and yanked him off the rope. He was then plopped ass-first onto the richly patterned floor and the pain in his thigh reasserted itself.
The woman who’d pulled him out was Seb, and the smell was coming from her.
“What is this place?” Mandri asked in whispered wonder.
“This be Minting Rock,” Seb said as her near-toothless mouth squelched a borcandi spine. She was obviously an old hand at borcandi biting because she carried herself with that borcandi bent—like her muscles were stuck in tension and had been that way for years, shoulders hunched and tight, head knocked forward, limbs all slightly bowed as if she’d coiled up in fright and rusted that way. 
“I don’t care about the name,” Mandri said. “What is this place? Who made it?”
Seb nudged Mandri’s hip with the toe of her boot, and then shooed him up against the wall with a few flaps of her fingers.
“Keep out of the way,” she said.
Mandri scooted backwards against the wall and shoved his injured leg flush against it, so that nothing of him stuck out into the floor. 
She eased in close, the neck of her robe yawned at Mandri’s nose, and her odor was pouring out—she smelled like butter gone bad. She peered into Mandri’s eyes and said, “I can tell you a burgeon biter, ain’t ya?”
Her odor was nauseating. Mandri scrunched up his nose and simply replied, “You smell.”
Seb stood back up, then wilted. Even a hard-up outland woman couldn’t abide being found out like that. A woman’s face could be ugly as mud, that was the world’s fault—but her smell, her smell was coming from the inside and it said something about her without her meaning to. A bad smell is the one thing that could make the most loutish street-junk keeper feel shame. A bad smell is a secret everyone’s got to keep.
“What’d I tell ya bout flappin’ them lips?”
Seb’s tired eyes managed to impress upon Mandri a great disappointment. Seb was a nobody amongst nobodies, as irrelevant as one of Jeket’s crawlers—beggars who beg from beggars. Mandri had a sense for these people even if they hadn’t yet fallen that far. There’s a dopiness about them, the face kind of sags. And they smell. To a man and woman, they smell.
A shrill whistle suddenly rang out from the oculus above. A heartbeat later, and Minting Rock was alive with the slapping patter of leather-soled feet as muffled shouts reared out of unseen corridors. It was as if Minting Rock’s door had just been knocked and all the house mutts were flung into a muster. Hill came climbing up the well-shaft rope, his stout frame slinking up and up like a fat caterpillar. He regarded neither Mandri nor Seb as he disappeared into the chamber above.
There came, springing out of the passage to Mandri’s left, a clink of metal on stone. This thumping clink repeated again and again, in time with a giant’s stride, growing louder as it neared Mandri’s chamber. Mandri found himself trembling when Ayram stormed into the room from the nearby hallway, beard-jutting and wild-eyed. In his hand was his long iron spear, which barely cleared the passage’s ceiling.
Moto followed him in, and waddling in behind Moto was the short, black-ragged witch, Elrahet. She lingered in the passage mouth, under the flickering lamps, and her dark hood cast a long, hard shadow which hid her eyes from view. Mandri watched her as she watched Ayram. There was a familiarity about her that he couldn’t quite place.
Ayram and Moto were standing in the opposite end of the room. On the ground between them was a shadowy lump. Moto kicked it, and a dull crack sounded out. He then grabbed one of the sculptured ribbons affixed to the wall to steady himself, and he was about to deliver another rough kick when Elrahet shouted, “Stop!”
Moto stopped.
“The Mazid is awake,” said Elrahet, as if pressed for time.
Moto stepped back and let the meager light reveal that the lump on the ground was Obo—he lay there with his half-lidded eyes blinking about like he’d just woken up from a dream.
“Tell me how you did it,” Ayram growled. His deep voice was twice as deep inside this echo chamber.
Obo looked up at Ayram and regarded the giant with contempt. He said, voice hoarse, “What are you blaming me for now?”
Ayram did not reply. He didn’t need to. A man his size could simply stand still, and that was intimidating enough to scare a reluctant tree into shaking off its fruit.
Obo pushed himself up into a sitting position. His head drooped as if his neck were so weak it couldn’t bear the burden. Mandri thought Obo was playing too hard for sympathy here.
Obo said, “I know it can be difficult, sometimes, to draw a clear line between cause and effect, but blaming me for anything seems unsound.”
Ayram lifted his great spear, then let it slip down his fist and its wide chisel tip hit the stone floor next to Obo’s hip.
Obo was unimpressed. “You’re the one that captured me and brought me here. If I’ve brought you any trouble, then you’ve brought it upon yourself.”
Ayram remained silent. Mandri suspected the man was realizing that Obo was incapable of feeling fear.
“If I may take a moment to ask,” said Obo. “What is it you truly plan to do with me? I’m a curious creature, I’d love to know.”
With a twist of his wrist, Ayram set the iron spike to rest against Obo’s collar bone. The weight of it almost tipped Obo over. Obo tried to shrug it off, but Ayram set it right back on the bone. 
Obo looked down at the spike’s tip and was unimpressed. “Did you honestly believe that a Hrkan Lord would make a weapon as powerful as me without devising a way to track me down should I get loose?”
“They can track you down to anywhere?” Moto asked. 
“Have you truly never heard of the Mazidariga?”
Mandri had never heard of the Mazidariga. And judging by the dumbfounded expression in Moto’s eyes, and the odd tilt in Ayram’s chin, neither man had heard of it either. Since neither were willing to admit to not knowing something, an uneasy silence went unbroken until Elrahet grumbled aloud, “Riga means shadow.”
Moto bent down and began to examine Obo’s shadow on the wall for a sign of some obscure magic.
“Not my literal shadow,” Obo said with disdain. “A Mazid’s shadow is a creature. They are grown alongside us. Their purpose is to hunt us down. You cannot hope to hide from the Hrks so long as you hold onto me.”
“Moto,” said Ayram after a thoughtful pause.
“Yes?”
“Get the boys blooded up.”
“Right,” said Moto. He then jumped onto the well-shaft rope and climbed out of sight with only a few, powerful pulls.
“You’re going to fight them?” Obo asked in disbelief as he watched Moto disappear. “That’s very brave. I hope you don’t expect I’ll be of much help.”
Ayram twisted around to glare at Obo, and then Mandri. It might have been the shadows, but Mandri thought he saw a flash of ire.
“Oh, it’s not Mandri’s fault,” said Obo. “He could be the most willful Minder of all, and it’d be no use. You see, a Mazidariga can—”
Ayram spun his spear around so that the sphere-end struck the ground. The metallic clang shut Obo up. Seb, anticipating a word from her leader, stepped forward.
Ayram said, “Take our useless Minder and his Mazid up into a haspt.”
Seb bowed in deference as Ayram and Elrahet swept out of the chamber, back into the passage from whence they came. Ayram’s iron clinked against the stone as he went, though the sound was soon lost amongst the yip and din as a band of the hardest pokes prepared themselves for battle.
Seb grabbed Mandri’s wrist and yanked him to his feet. Mandri groaned as his leg screamed. Seb hurried over to Obo and made a fuss about wrapping him up tight so that his blood-wet stub sacks wouldn’t taint her person. Once Obo was swaddled up tight as a baby, arms folded inside a restricting robe, Seb picked him up and carried him under-arm like a freshly-wrapped package of beef. 
She ran into the dark passage. Then she popped back out and grunted for Mandri to follow.
Mandri limped after her, steadying himself against the sculptured stone, but he couldn’t keep up.
“Hurry up!” Seb cried as she doubled back and took hold of Mandri’s wrist. She pulled Mandri towards a sputtering lamp whose light flickered over a set of chubby, upward swirling stairs. Ascending these stairs put an odd twist in Mandri’s mental map of the place, and it became difficult to maintain a sense of where he was within the rock. There was almost no light, and he was shoved through so many warped passages that all he knew for certain was that he was moving away from the center. Every new chamber and corridor became more cluttered and cramped, and the stonework less polished and more rough. The walls were still sculpted into an otherworldly weave but Mandri’s fingers could feel an inattention to thickness of edge. It was clumsy work, clumsy in comparison to what he’d seen in that central shaft.
Mandri got to thinking, after bumping his head on an absurdly low door frame, that whoever had carved this rock had perhaps carved out too much of it. Unless Old Jandri tribesmen were as learned as Hrkan architects in the art of stressing stone, the whole thing was bound to fall apart. And the further up and out Mandri went, the more slapdash the passages and rooms became. By the time he reached the outer edge of the rock, and saw a slit of bright blue sky though an embrasure, his fingers were brushing over stress cracks in walls. Once, in this dusty dark, he bumped his shoulder against an unworked wooden beam that arched over his head. He swore he saw the floor above buckle and sag.
Seb pushed him into a long and narrow room. It was long enough for him to lay down in, but barely enough room to turn around. This space had access to outside air through a stippled pattern of finger-sized holes bored into the far wall. The sun didn’t shine directly through them, so these pinpricks of day sat on the black rock wall illuminating nothing, like a constellation of stars. They composed an Old Jandri pattern—a simple, eight-flamed sun, the traditional symbol of Solraheen.
Seb elbowed Mandri further into this shoulder-squeezing closet, and that’s when the room’s defining quality hit him—the air inside was thick with a foul smell, sweet and horrible, cloying, as if a mound of peaches were putrefying in some dark corner. Mandri gagged, clutched at his nose, and when the spicy bitterness stung the back of his tongue like rancid burgeon bile he spat and choked.
He thought, at first, that this was some kind of prayer room and that the smell was incense put here to trigger his spiritual impulse. He didn’t entertain the thought that this scent was meant to mask a fouler smell until he reached out into the dark to steady himself, and instead of slapping against stone, his fingers sank into something that felt curiously like skin.
He yelped and recoiled.
He leaned back into the opposite wall, and his palm brushed up against a dried and bony limb.
He yelped again, and prayed fast that Solraheen would adjust his eyes to the darkness. He’d have pulled his own Spark out to see.
Seb slapped the back of his head. “Keep your hands to yourself.”
“What’s in here?”
“Don’t worry about it.”
Seb pushed Mandri towards the stipple-pricked sigil of Solraheen.
Mandri turned to protest his new accommodation.
“Sit down and be quiet,” Seb commanded.
Before Mandri could frame his dissent, a dark shape flew towards him and crashed into his stomach. He wheezed, went sprawling against the wall and sank down to the floor. He fumbled around in the dark and squealed in disgust when his thumb poked through a stiff and gristly cloth and dove into something with the consistency of fire-crusted jelly.
He’d just plumbed his thumb into Obo’s stumped thigh.
“Get off me!” Mandri shrieked.
“I hardly can,” said Obo. “I’m wrapped up tight.”
Mandri picked Obo up with his one good hand. The Mazid was as light as a three-year-old.
“Put me down.”
“Stop wiggling.”
“I’m not, you’re shaking me.”
“There’s nowhere to put you.”
“Quit flappin’!” Seb shouted. “And stop touchin’ shit. Place is sacred.”
Mandi didn’t want to get slapped so he shut up and stuffed Obo between his good right leg and the wall. He had to bunch himself up closer to the other side of this narrow closet of a room, and that was a dicey proposition, because something dead was resting there and he didn’t want his wound rubbing up against it. 
Mandri prayed for a light, and by Sol, there it was—the diffuse orange glow of a lamp light came creeping up the corridor behind Seb. Seb spun around and there was the girl Moteah, standing in the room’s entrance, looking less prim and proper than Mandri remembered. Her long beige robe had a few wrinkles, and her severe headscarf was gone, showing her hair to be as wild as a weedbush. Her black skin glistened from all the kell oil she’d smeared on her face.
Mandri recalled the sight of her glaring at him in that pit cave a day or two before. Somehow, she seemed even more uptight, and she peered around Seb at Mandri, as if looking for him. 
“Move,” she said to Seb. Seb begrudgingly stepped out of the room to give Moteah the space to enter. As she did, the oil-dish lamp she held before her splayed its light into the room’s interior, bringing this haunting ‘closet’ to life.
Cut into the black rock walls were coffin-sized slits, three on either side, stacked one above the other. Inside each of these, resting in peaceful repose, was a corpse, each in a different stage of decomposition, and each naked as it came from the womb, and all of them, as far as Mandri could tell, were giant men. Ayram-sized men. Their beards were black and gray.
The corpse that the light lit clearest was as black and shriveled as a grape weeks fallen from the vine. It was impossible to say for certain how long that body had been lying there, for an unbothered corpse in the Sand could last an age, but cloistered away in Minting Rock, sheltered from the wind and abrasion, well Mandri figured that a corpse could last for as long as Solraheen willed it. That body could be as ancient as the sun itself.
Shadows licked at the corpse’s dry, pruned up shoulder. Its desiccated hand with purpled fingers sat on the grave’s edge, like a giant spider creeping into the light. All of it was frosted by a layer of dust. There was no hint of bloat, no tar-like iridescence of fresh rot, though it was clearly the source of the smell. Mandri compared the disgusting sight of it to his own leg. He wasn’t faring much better.
Moteah set her lamp down in a shallow recess in the wall which had been carved for the purpose. In her other arm she clutched a small grass basket close to her chest, and this she set on the floor at Mandri’s feet. She squatted down and began to unload it—first out was a puffy square of gray wool folded into itself. Next was a bundle of damp, hairy, spade-shaped leaves knotted at the stems. Then came a stone mortar which tinked against the floor. Last came three small alabastron jars that were packed to the brim with waxy substances, one red, one green, and one blue. Moteah hesitated with these, treated them more gently than the rest, and once all were arrayed out before her, she handed the basket back to Seb, who tucked it mindlessly into one of the corpsedens.
“All yours,” Seb said, and she left the room.
Moteah ignored her and said, “Let me see the bite.”
Mandri hesitated, then drew up his robe and leaned onto his right ass cheek. He rolled his wounded thigh into the light. The old poultice was wrinkled and sloppy, hanging half off, and Moteah eyed the dark veins in his leg with a keen interest.
“Would you look at that,” she muttered.
She pulled a thumb-sized pestle from her woolen robes and she dolloped a two-finger-dip of each of the colorful waxes into her mortar.
“How bad does it hurt?”
“About as bad as can be.”
Mandri winced as she peeled back the old poultice to reveal the black wound underneath. It was an awful sight, smothered over with that mucky paste.
“You are lucky,” she said. “One more night and it would have killed you.”
“Wish it would.”
Moteah pushed Mandri back with a miffed look, and then set herself to mixing the medicine in the mouth of her mortar. She poured a finger-full of water from her personal waterskin into it, swirled it around with the wax, then plucked three leaves and dropped them onto the swimming globs of color. She let it all soak for a spell, and then she began to knead it all into a paste.
Mandri watched with eager intent, and so did Obo. Obo leaned over Mandri’s legs, tried to peer into the mixture, but since he was hardly more than a ribcage swiveling on hips, leaning was a chancy thing. Mandri had to catch him to keep him from tipping over, and this commotion interrupted the rhythmic thump of Moteah’s pestle.
She paused and gave Obo the same miffed look she’d given Mandri a moment before.
Obo caught her eye and said, “I thought that wax was insoluble in water.”
“Must not be wax,” she said, and she resumed smashing the bits of leaves down into the sopping goop. By now the colors were beginning to mix, turning a greenish shade of brown that looked nearly black in the lamplight. Obo was polite enough to wait until she was finished to ask, “Would you mind if I tasted it?”
The disgust in Moteah’s face was absolute. Most outland women end up with rumpled foreheads, and it’s not only from squinting at the sun. From first blood they’re fighting wars of aggravation against outland men. The difference here was that the nuisance at hand was a Mazid, not a man, and he wasn’t rebuffed in the usual way. His eyes were bright, expecting entertainment.
Moteah huffed her irritation, then set again to her work. She unfolded the woolen square to make a pocket, which she then packed full with the dark goo from her mortar.
“I’d like to introduce myself,” Obo said.
“I’d like you not to,” she replied as she scraped the bottom of the mortar to make sure she’d left no leavings.
“What about you?” Obo asked Mandri. “Would you like to introduce yourself?”
“No, not really.”
“Are you sure?”
“Obo, be quiet.” 
“You call it Obo?” Moteah asked as her brow knit ever tighter.
“That’s his name.”
“You’re not to talk to it.”
“Then put him in a different room.”
Moteah soured at Mandri’s sass. She cradled the poultice patch in her hand and slapped it paste-down on Mandri’s wound. A shock of pain ran through his hip, and he nearly bit through his tongue. Just as he was about to curse the girl’s name, a quick iciness shot into his leg and chased the pain deep down to the bone. When the wincing excitement wore off, he was surprised to find that the pain was gone completely. His leg was numb cold.
“Oh,” he said, relief shaping his voice. “That was fast.”
Moteah’s eyes narrowed. “You’re welcome.” She was clearly expecting thanks, but unfortunately for her, she looked a little too much like her brother for Mandri to say thank you.
“You know your brother did this to me,” he said.
The twist in Moteah’s brow unraveled with a tired sigh.  She sat back on her haunches and said, “I would apologize, but I try not to make a habit of cleaning up after him.” 
“Oh,” Mandri muttered. “Well, thanks—for, you know—this.”
She flashed a quick smile, more in reflex than appreciation. “You’ve had a hard few days, so, don’t chase away help when it comes.”
“You’re here to help?”
“I am.”
“Beautiful. If you could help me escape, that’d be great.”
She smiled, this time it was big and bright. “You wouldn’t last a hand out in the Sand by yourself.”
“Does that matter? I don’t suppose I’ll last long with you people either.”
She hesitated before replying. It almost looked like she was counting her words. She said, “I know Ayram is rough, and Elrahet can be worse, but out here that works. It doesn’t work with everyone, I know, but what you have to remember is that the cause is all that matters.”
“Killing a demon?”
“Killing the Amalgamete, yes.”
“If I may ask,” Obo interrupted, “Why was Mandri chosen to be Minder, of all people?”
Mandri marveled at how hard it was to read Obo’s face. The Mazid played at indignation, but it wasn’t quite that, not really. Hard to read a face without features—hairless brows, lashless eyes, and colorless skin—Obo looked more like an under-painting than a fully realized person.
Moteah said, “Elrahet chose him, and I trust her judgment.”
“Why trust her?” Obo asked. “She seems mad.”
“She’s a witch,” Mandri added.
“She’s much more than a witch. I know she seems…unpleasant, but she is here to help. In her own way, she is here to help.”
“She’s the one who cut off my hand, right? Put it in Obo’s chest?”
Moteah nodded.
“Obo says that me being made Minder is going to kill me. Is that true?”
“The sooner we kill the Amalgamete, the sooner you can be rid of the Mazid and any ill effects.”
She saw Mandri wasn’t convinced, and she added, “Do you not want to kill the source of evil in this world?”
“I never even heard of the beast until a few days ago. I’ve never seen it.”
“Oh, you’ll see it, and when you see it, you’ll understand.”
Obo asked, “Have you seen it?”
“Yes, and no.”
As Mandri wondered how that could be construed as an acceptable answer, a worried, wordless shout sounded out from somewhere below. That shout was followed by a loud, two-fingered whistle ringing through the rock. 
Moteah fetched her basket and gathered her ministrations. She swept herself up, and before she left the room she turned and asked, “If I leave, do you swear to stay here?”
Mandri gathered up the loose ends of his poultice wrap and tied them around his leg. “I don’t think I’m ready to run away just yet,” he said.
She stood firm. “Swear it.”
Mandri chuckled and said, “I swear it.”
He would have explained that he wasn’t good for his word, but she’d already left. Thankfully, she’d left her oil lamp.
“She is interesting,” Obo remarked.
“Better than her brother, that’s for sure.”
“I agree. But all it takes is one ruined dream to make you people miserable.”
“Is that so?” Mandri asked as he tied a tight knot below the poultice to add a little something to support it.
“That girl seems to think that you will be able to wield me. Unfortunately that will never happen.”
“Why not?”
“To put it simply—you’re too kind to be a Minder.”
“Hah!” Mandri exclaimed as a smirk played on his lips. “Obo, you don’t know the first thing about me.”
“But I do. You forget that I am bound to your will. As we speak your fingers are gripping my heart. I can feel what you feel, if it’s strong enough. I’ve had four different Minders, four different wills coursing through my veins, and each was as pitiless as the other. So believe me when I tell you that I know what cruelty feels like—you don’t have it. It’s a constant gnawing. If you aren’t cruel, then you must be kind.”
Mandri had a hard time getting past the image of his hand squeezing Obo’s heart. He said, “Kindness doesn’t mean what you think it means.”
“Oh?”
“Think about it. On average, and this is more than true, on average people are more likely to hate each other than love each other. So if kindness is how people treat their own kind, then a kind person is a selfish, hostile person.”
“I think you’ve spent too much time biting burgeons.”
“You think I’m wrong?”
“I think you’re distracted. It doesn’t matter what word we use to describe the particular feeling that you feel. I said kindness, and while that might not be it, it doesn’t change the fact that you aren’t cruel. At any rate, we’re far afield from the problem at hand.”
“I disagree. We’re right on point. If you were to tell me to be kind to someone, I’m going to be kind, but I have a different, more correct, understanding of the word.”
“No. Stop.”
Obo wiggled around in his tightly wrapped robes. He cocked his ear towards the stipple-pricked wall and listened for something which Mandri could not hear.
Mandri asked, “What is it?”
After a suspenseful pause, Obo answered, “There is a column of Hrkan Skulsi marching towards this rock.”
“Oh.”
“When they get here, they’re going to slaughter us all.”
Obo’s silver eyes settled into an easy gleam as if he were happy about it.
Mandri was about to ask ‘how long till they arrive’, but the answer rudely interrupted him—from out beyond the stipple-pricked sun of Solraheen came the deep and yawning howl of the Hrkan horn of war. 

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooommmm

The whole room vibrated. The rest of Minting Rock was sent stirring with the hollers as the Ayramun whooped their excitement. Mandri, bewildered, gingerly pushed himself up against the narrow walls, careful to not bother his leg, all so that he could turn and look through one of the small holes in that stippled sun. He couldn’t see much, but sure enough, set against a field of fiery sand was a distant column of white-robed men.
“Well, I think this proves my point,” he said. “People don’t march around like that to help widows and orphans, do they?”
“They don’t.”
“That is the kindness of men in full regalia… and now we wait to see whose kindness is stronger, those Hrks or our Ayramun.”
“I can almost guarantee that you will be dead in less than half a hand.”
“I think the Ayramun can win.”
“Seventeen Ayramun against eighty Skulsi is long odds.”
“Ayram’s got to count for at least twenty. And this rock is practically a fortress. It’s got murder holes. What are the Hrks going to do, lay siege? Out here in the desert?”
“I don’t know, but I’m sure they have a plan.”
“And we’ve got a Mazid.”
“Who is ‘we’?”
“Oh come on, Obo. You know, I’ve never actually seen a Mazid spit Mazidfire.”
“And you likely never will.”
“We could at least try.”
“Do what you will.”
“Teach me.”
“I can’t.”
“You know how it works. Come on, I thought we were friends.”
“We are?”
“Obo, if you open your mouth and blast those Hrks to Shis, I will wash your feet with sweet oil.”
“I don’t have any feet.”
“I’ll wash your nubs with the richest sweet oil I can find. I’ll make it myself.”
 Obo smiled, but he still didn’t match Mandri’s enthusiasm. He said, “You know that Mazidariga I mentioned earlier?”
“What of it?”
“Just wait a moment. It’s going to end me.”
Mandri was halfway through a frustrated sigh, when a shrill and steady whistle sounded out from the Hrkan column and pierced his thoughts, pushing out all other concerns. 
It was a metallic, tinny tone that quivered like a strandtail’s warble, only it was ten times louder and harsher than any shriek any bird could ever make. That damned sound cut through the rock so clearly that its source might as well have been in the room. For Mandri, it was an ear-splitting pain, but to Obo it was doing something stranger.
The Mazid had fallen over onto his side and was squirming. His eyes rolled around in their sockets, twitching and turning as if a worm were chewing his ocular nerve. The whistling jumped to a higher pitch and Obo’s whole body began to convulse in violent fits. Mandri reached out to keep Obo’s head from thumping against the stone, but Obo’s stomach wretched, his chest heaved, and a dim gray formless ember shot out from his mouth, leaving his body limp and lifeless.
The strange light hovered just above Obo’s lips for the briefest sPel, and then the whistling shifted its register again, higher still into a pitch reserved for animal spirits, and the gray ember shot right towards Mandri’s head.
He ducked and the ember whizzed past his neck, its energy scorching his skin as it went. It zipped on to punch a hole the size of Mandri’s fist into the rock behind him. Mandri spun around in time to watch it fly up into the air. He lost sight of it for a moment against the bright midday sky, then found it again as it dove towards the distant column of Hrks. As it fell, the whistling fell to a drowning timbre, until, with a flash, the light and the whistling were snuffed out altogether, apparently swallowed by a figure at the head of the Hrkan column—a figure much shorter than the rest and robed in black.
Before Mandri’s ears could recover their tuning, the Hrkan horn of war sounded out again.

BWWWEEEEeeeeoooooooommmm

The deep bellow shook Mandri out of his skin. Terror welled up in his gut. He could see the column clearly now through his punched out window, and as the Hrks marched they flattened out into a solid square. A command was barked and the soldiers quickened their advance, bracing their white, oblong shields up against the smattering of arrows that was sure to come.
Twenty paces later, and Mandri heard the twang of bows and the fluttering phhht of arrow fletchings brushing through the air, rushing high up into the sky. Ten Hrkan paces later, and a flock of black arrows fell upon the hide of that onrushing Hrkan square. Most of these missiles bounced harmlessly away, but some snuck in between the scales, marked here and there by the sudden tumbling of one of the Hrkan number, each followed by a chorus of triumphant yips as several Ayramun took credit all at once.
These little victories did nothing to slow the Hrkan advance. Every gap opened by the felling of one soldier was closed in quick-step time, and when, at last, it was clear that they would not scatter and flee, the yips of the Ayramun twisted into stressed appeals for Solraheen’s intervention. The more practical among them sprinted from room to room, trying to find better angled holes to fire upon their target, sometimes crashing into each other, each screaming insults as whole bundles of arrows were split.
Seb rushed by Mandri’s hole, then came back, noticing the fresh new vantage in the wall.
“Move out of the way!” she shouted as she ran in. She kicked Obo’s lifeless body to the side, then squatted down and started firing arrows at the marching men. They were close enough now that their eyes could be clearly seen peering over their shields.
Seb fired her arrows with ruthless efficiency, but judging by the stream of curses that followed every shot, she was missing her mark. After each twang of her bow, her shooting angle shifted steeper and steeper down to match the Hrkan advance, until at last the white-cloaked Hrks tucked themselves up under Minting Rock’s bulging belly. Seb then grabbed her bow in both hands and snapped it on her knee. She tossed the kindling at Mandri and pulled her dagger, then fled from the room.
Then Mandri heard a noise which froze his body solid.

Chink-TINK.

“What was that?” Mandri wondered aloud.

Chink-TINK.

It sounded like a chisel.
He looked again through the hole in the wall and tried to make sense of the situation. So high up, it was impossible to see directly below. He only caught glimpses of upturned shields, and in the center of each, the gold-eyed Hrkan sun was looking up at him with dumb indifference.

TINK-TINK-TINK

The chiseling was getting louder, faster, followed close behind by the roars of Hrkan men possessed by the spirit of battle. Somewhere far below, in Minting Rock’s entrance well, limbs were getting hacked to pieces.
Then came a loud stone-splitting crack and the whole of Minting Rock lurched. 
Mandri stumbled but caught himself as the sound of crunching rock ran through the floor and ceiling.

CRRRCKKKKkkkk-krrrk-kkkkkk-k

All went silent in the wake of this rock-hewn thunder.
No shouts of struggle below.
No clash of sword on shield.
For a brief, glorious moment, every Sparked body, from man to flea, dropped their troubles and shared the exact same fearish feeling, and this glorious communion might have lasted forever if it weren’t split by the tinny sound of another chisel strike on stone.

TINK

A long, jagged crack exploded into the floor of Mandri’s burial chamber as Minting Rock lurched again. The dust of ages shook loose from the ceiling, as if the room above had been hammered by Solraheen’s fist.
“Obo,” Mandri said to the glassy-eyed and lifeless Mazid. “Obo, we’d better leave.”
Another jolt shook the room, and the crack in the floor opened wider. Mandri shuffled away just as a thunderous boom sent the crack darting across the whole length of the floor and up the sun-stippled wall, fracturing the chamber in two. With a sudden crunch, the chamber’s whole left side slid down an inch before coming to a rest on some new fault in the foundation far below.
Mandri, fear pulsing wild in his chest, yanked one of the aged corpses out of its resting place and tossed it onto the ground. He then grabbed Obo’s limp body and threw the Mazid into the now unoccupied grave. He pushed Obo as far towards the back as he could, and then he crawled in alongside. The very moment that Mandri tucked in his legs, the opposite wall started to collapse.
The first thing to go was Moteah’s clay oil lamp. It jostled loose from its perch and smashed onto the floor, splashing licks of oil and flame about the room. Then the wall behind it shook, and the seams in the ceiling burst, shooting a jet of smoke into the room, flooding Mandri’s grave with dust, obscuring the air so completely that Mandri could not see the hail of stone come crashing down.
What he did see, after wiping the dust from his eyes, was the awesome sight of Minting Rock split in half like a geode.
Before he could even register his shock, the opposite half began to fall away. 
Haunting screams split the air as those Ayramun stuck on the wrong side of this split-open stone grasped their impending doom. Three men jumped across to Mandri’s side, but below, a ragged, fear-stricken woman straddled the half-shorn wall of what once was a tunnel. Mandri watched in terror as she rode the undone structure down into a billowing cloud of dust, crying, “Sol! Sol!” as she went.
Mandri closed his eyes against the deafening crash.
“Solraheen, my god,” he prayed. It was the start of a daily prayer, but there was nothing in it for he’d long forgotten the rest of the words. He hoped it was the thought that counted.
He opened his eyes again, and peered down at the chaos from his blessed perch. The floor was completely gone, and in its place was a hundred foot drop down into a swirl of rust-colored smoke. Beyond that, the bright desert stretched out for forever.
A shout rang out below. This wasn’t a shout of fright. It was a shout of effort, of murder. Mandri watched as the swirling smoke lifted to reveal a swarm of white Hrkan cloaks, some moving amongst the crumble of black rock, some deathly still, and some of those black rocks moved, some jumped out of the structure still left standing—these were Ayramun in their dark, dusty rags. Once again, the battle was joined.
Mandri crept back into his hole—there was no clear way to get down, not that he wanted to. He was oddly happy to be stuck up in his high hole. No matter who won down below, he’d be safe.

TINK-TINK-TINK

Whatever demon had split open Minting Rock was not finished, and this time Mandri could feel the chisel strokes resonate all through the rock around him.
He curled up in his grave, wrapped his head in his hands and tried to shut out the horror of it, but this was no good, because his sense of equilibrium remained, and it screamed bloody murder as his half of Minting Rock began to tilt.
At first it was only a slight shifting as the rock swayed away from the melee down below. Then a loud clap of snapping stone sounded out, and Mandri’s perch swayed precariously back the opposite direction. He scrambled to grab hold of something, to stop himself from spilling out of his hole and into the open air, and just as his hip began to slide, a thunder of faulting joints burst up from below, and a puff of smoke shot up from the ground.
The whole terrifying thing swayed back away yet again, before settling into an unstable, precipitous tilt.
What was left of Minting Rock dithered there, letting the dread get nice and settled in Mandri’s belly, until, at last, there came a shattering CRACK, and the structure began to fall.
Mandri braced himself in that half-shorn tomb as the horizon fell out of the sky.
The whole structure rolled onto its back like a freshly halved melon, and Mandri could do nothing but look to the sky and be helpless. If there were clouds they would have been zipping by, but there was only the atmosphere, that gradient of blue shifting into a deeper blue, and for the first time ever, Mandri noticed that the desert sky is a bluer blue than any other. He didn’t have time to wonder why that was, for amid the rush and tumble his sight was swallowed up by a cloud of black-red dust, a suffocating blur of sand and stone. As Mandri began to realize the horror of being buried alive, his rock grave snapped open, and the back of it sprung loose like a tensioned lever, catapulting him into the air. 
Mandri flew low above the surface of the earth, and such was his speed that he smashed right through the brambles of a karkle bush before tumbling into a ragdoll skip along the surface of the warm, red-orange sand.
When he finally came to a stop, he found himself half buried in a fledgling dune.
And he was alive.
He pulled himself free from the earth, spat some of it out of his mouth, coughed a bit of dust out of his lungs, then rubbed his eyes open, surprised to see that his scrawny self was still well-put-together. The shoulder which had borne the brunt of impact wasn’t even scratched. There weren’t any bones sticking out, at least. And while the demon bite on his leg was still smarting, Moteah’s poultice was still knotted tight. Everything else was where it was supposed to be, save for his hand. The only thing that truly hurt was the left side of his face, which had bit the sand when he landed. Still, that was nothing. Considering everything, that was nothing. He’d been tossed almost fifty yards and was no worse for wear. Meanwhile, what was left of Minting Rock had collapsed into a heap of rubble.
It was a miracle. 
It was a miracle coming after a string of miracles.
By rights he should be dead—dead three times over. In Meskalim, Salavan had choked him to death, and he’d come back from that. He’d been chewed up by a demon, and he just so happened to be traveling with a woman who knew how to cure it. And now he’d survived a fall from a height that should have squashed him flat.
Yet here he was, alive and breathing.
“Wild.”
He looked up at the bright blue sky and blinked at the sun, and he felt, in that blessed moment, that he was staring into the Spark of Solraheen Himself. Perhaps this rapture would have drawn out a word of praise, and he might have become, then and there, the most devout of all possible men, but it was not to be, for a Hrkan Skulsi was creeping up behind him.
“Die, you rangy lizard!”
Mandri turned and saw a mustachioed man in a sparkling white robe running at him with his blade drawn high. Despite the look of fury and rage twisting this soldier’s face, Mandri wasn’t frightened. Actually, he felt a confidence brewing. If he was supposed to be dead three times over, then what was a fourth?
He held up his hands and shouted, “I surrender!”
The soldier stopped his sprint and seemed pleased to hear it. A proud curve swelled in his chest, and he stomped over to where Mandri knelt. 
“My luck I should catch a coward,” he said. He held his shining iron sword towards Mandri’s neck and beckoned with its tip for Mandri to stand up.
Mandri stood up.
“Walk,” said the soldier, and he pointed with his sword in the desired direction, towards a detachment of white cloaked soldiers standing some thirty yards away from the cloud of Minting Rock’s still seething rubble. Those Hrks stood shoulder to shoulder, watching the throes of Minting Rock as if it were something they’d seen ten times before, and perhaps they had. They were big, bearded men, veterans of many battles.
Mandri winced as his captor’s sword prodded the small of his back, and he walked towards the Hrkan line. The squealing stone of Minting Rock settled into its final resting place, giving Mandri’s still-stunned hearing the chance to pick out the clamor of battle—breathless shouts of fury, metal clanging against metal, a staccato burst of excited yips, punctuated by a twist of agony.
The first actual figure to pop out of that lifting smoke was Moto. Of course, the Zosan of all people should survive. He crouched atop a tall, slanted chunk of former floor, and with one hand he steadied himself, and with his sword he deftly waved off three Hrkan blades swiping at his ankles. Then Moteah came scrambling out from a hole in the nearby rubble, and as soon as she came she disappeared back into the swirling cloud of dust. Two Hrkan cloaks chased after her, but both came to a sudden, fluttering stop after something swung out of the dust and slammed into both their chests at once—a bone-crunching WHUMP.
The two men collapsed to the ground, and standing over them was Ayram.
The giant was so caked in dust that he looked like a creature borne from the Sand. The upper part of his black robe was hanging in tatters over his waistband like it were half-molted skin, and his long black hair, freed from his headwrap, was sweeping his shoulders clean as he twirled his blackened iron spear like it were a reed. He slammed it down and smashed its knobby end right through the skull of one of the fallen Hrks.
The blood-crunch was so loud and gruesome that Mandri almost tripped on it.
The three Hrkan men who’d been hassling Moto turned their pestering swords towards the giant. These men screamed curses at Ayram, this giant who’d slain their comrade with such brutal indifference. Ayram charged them, swung his spear in a swooping arc, and that famed Skulsi discipline went to Shis as the iron crunched through the first Hrk’s shield. In a blur, the chisel-head swung round and sliced right through the face of another Hrk. The final hapless soldier charged and stabbed, but such was Ayram’s speed that his iron spear was around again in time to brush the sword right out of the Skulsi’s hand. 
The man backed away in fright. He picked up a rock and threw it at Ayram’s head, and before Mandri could see how Ayram dealt with it, he felt another sharp prodding in his back.
“Get a move on!” his captor shouted. The man was unconcerned about his comrade’s plight. He was more interested in getting Mandri to the Hrkan line. So impatient was he, that he took Mandri by the wrist, upped the pace to a jog, and yanked a howling Mandri along behind, for though Moteah’s poultice was a soothing balm, the demon-bitten leg wasn’t capable of handling a run.
After much fumbling and stumbling, they reached the Hrkan detachment and Mandri was thrown down to the sand. His captor set the cold edge of his blade on the back of Mandri’s neck to keep his head bowed in supplication. The man then pounded his chest twice, the standard Hrkan salute, and with the snap of a well-drilled soldier he declared, “My sirs, I’ve found another skulking bandit.”
Mandri overcame the fear of the blade pressing against his neck to peep at the ‘sirs’ this soldier was referring to, and he was stunned to see that standing in front of him was a child, a boy, robed in black. Mandri stole a second glance and realized that it was not a boy, but a creature, white and hairless underneath its robes, just like Obo. It was so short that Mandri, kneeling, met him eye to bloodshot eye. Shielding this creature’s nose and mouth was a smooth iron plate riveted onto a leather band that was strapped tight around its head. It was a strange sort of muzzle, with only a small beveled hole for sipping air, and, Mandri presumed, for whistling, for no doubt this was the Mazidariga who had whistled Obo’s pseudospark into its own stomach. 
This Riga’s eyes were a child’s eyes, large and curious, yet their whites were so red that their edges were weeping blood, and worse still, the creature seemed unbothered by it.
Next to this Riga child was a short bald man clad in the gray-blue robes of a Hrkan scribe. All the fat on this man’s body seemed to have settled in his face, giving him a curiously large head for his diminutive frame. It was such an incongruity, and scribes were such venal creatures, that Mandri wondered if this man had bribed some youth for the use of their body. It was either that, or he, next to this Mazidariga, was a fleshcrafted work of the Hrkan Lords.
This scribe did not look at all pleased to see Mandri. No scribe ever was, for scribes of rank were learned men of acquired power, and they kept their silver sunrose brooches bright and blinding. They put so much effort into setting themselves apart that they could sense when someone didn’t appreciate them. 
The man looked down at Mandri, and with plain derision in his voice he said, “Another coward lurking in the rubble. And look—he’s missing a hand.”
The Riga child coughed, as if clearing his throat of sores, then said through its muffling mask, “The Mazid’s smell is on him.” There was no hint of menace in the child’s words—it was merely a statement of fact. 
“Yes,” said the scribe, thoughtfully. He turned to address the soldier who’d captured Mandri. “The young master told you to fetch the Mazid’s body, not some outland poke playing at a Mazid’s Minder.”
“Yes sir. Yes, sirs.” 
The soldier saluted again, then ran back towards the rubble.
“And you,” the scribe said to Mandri, “I don’t suppose I’ll find your hand in the Mazid’s body, will I? You’ve committed a grave desecration. The Law affords you an opportunity to repent of your crimes, but I don’t suppose you’ll take it.”
“I, uh—”
“Very well,” the scribe said without giving Mandri a chance to finish the thought. “You shall be delivered to the nearest Lord and sold into slavery. Someone take him away.”
“Hold on!” Mandri whined. “Now, hold on. I haven’t done anything.”
“Oh, you haven’t, have you?” the scribe said, clearly amused.
“I’m an honest Jandri man,” said Mandri. “The people in that rock stole me outside of Meskalim three days ago. I am their prisoner.”
“A prisoner?” The scribe said, and his incredulity slid naturally into a skeptical, chubby-cheeked chortle. The man then leaned over to address the Mazidariga to ensure the child had the correct interpretation of Mandri’s words.
“This is what we call outland bluster. He is no doubt an outlaw like the rest of them.”
“Is he?” the Riga croaked.
“Indeed he is. He is a liar. We shall keep him along with the other liar so they may be dealt the liar’s punishment.”
The scribe nodded to a nearby soldier, who then dragged Mandri to his feet and led him behind the Hrkan line to where Seb was being held. 
Seb was so caked in the dust of Minting Rock’s collapse that she looked like a mangled root just dug up from the earth. Though her frown was unreal, she looked surprised to see Mandri. She did not speak a word of acknowledgment.
“Right then,” said the scribe. “Time to clean this mess up.” 
The Hrkan horn sounded out and the soldiers lurched forwards into a ridiculous march, a heel-stomping strut, and they looked proud to do it, as if the Hrkan Lords themselves were watching. The scribe and Mazidariga walked in front, while both Mandri and Seb were forced at sword point to keep close behind. Soon the Hrkan soldiers came to a halt and spread out into a skirmishing line, giving Mandri a clean view of the corpse of Minting Rock.
The structure, having split in two and fallen apart, now formed two halves of an impromptu arena, with the rubble on either side rising step-like into the air, complete with dead spectators oozing out between the cracks of pancaked floors. Staged on the arena below was the giant Ayram. He stood resolute with four dead Hrks at his feet, one with his nose smashed flat against his skull, another with his face opened up completely. It seemed that Ayram had the beautician’s impulse for rearrangement, as well as a madman’s taste—he seemed to believe that a man’s face was more pleasing to the eye if it were parted down the middle and hanging down around the shoulders.
Behind Ayram, crouching up on rocks like black-scratchers fleeing an incoming tide, were three of his band—Moto, the old witch Elrahet, and Moteah.
The scribe stepped forth to address them all.
“The battle is over,” he said, projecting a firm and commanding tone. “Lay down your weapons and submit yourselves to the Law.”
The scribe clearly bore no actual expectation that the Ayramun would surrender. This was a formality, and formalities were honored because formality was what separated civilized men from the animals. The difference between a slaughter and the exercise of justice was whether or not it was preceded by an announcement. If one announces what they’re going to do, whatever happens next is the victim’s fault. 
The scribe rolled his shoulders back, puffed out his chest and said, “Since you have chosen life outside of the natural laws which govern all mankind, you will be dealt with according to the law of beasts. You shall be captured and sold in the court of the Great Lord Hababeen. If you persist in your barbarity, we shall undress your weight with a dull blade and feed your trimmings to pigs.”
The scribe’s chubby cheeks spread into a frown, as if he weren’t pleased to be issuing his threat—this was also a formality. Mandri had met his fair share of scribes assigned to posts in the Sand, and to a man they were all perverted. The strange bureaucracy that surrounds the culling of outland folk attracts them, and the closer they held to the letter of the law, the more perverse was the performance, and the more satisfaction they got from pulling out the pokes.
The scribe motioned for both Mandri and Seb to be brought to him.
 “Toss your weapon onto the ground,” he said to Ayram, “Or all of you shall be carved to the bone, beginning with these two skulking cowards.”
Ayram planted the chisel-tip of his giant iron spear into the sand, but he did not loosen his grip.
The scribe grabbed Mandri by the scruff. “Let it be known that the course of law was offered and was rejected.” 
He pulled a short knife from his robe and raised it up so all could see.
“I say one last time—toss your weapon! The light of the law demands it!”
He lowered the knife to meet Mandri’s throat.
Ayram looked like an ancient outland idol cloaked in the dust of untamed earth and anointed with the blood of weaker creatures. Mandri watched with bated breath as this wildman decided whether or not to surrender to a frail-backed, skinny-fat scribe. Yes, there were Skulsi here too, but never in all the turns of the world could such a man surrender to such a man.
Mandri felt an urge to do something to save his neck, and this desperate urge was overwhelming, it clawed itself out of his stomach regardless of whether or not it was welcome in the world. He squirmed—he knew not why but he squirmed under the scribe’s firm grip. He could feel the man’s fingers sense his desperation. Mandri squirmed, and he was so unused to this urge’s working on him that it passed through him all too easily, too quickly, so that instead of coiling him up and unleashing a twist of fury, what came out of his body was a sneeze—a sneeze with snot and spittle—and it came bursting out to fleck the knife and hand of the Hrkan scribe.
ACHOO!
The scribe recoiled in horror at the sight of the flag of snot dripping down the meat of his thumb. “You disgusting poke!” he screamed. He made to wipe it off on Mandri’s robe, but before he could, Ayram’s spear slammed into his chest.
The scribe was thrown back by force. A rasping howl issued from his throat as the spear slid halfway through him and pinned him to the sand like a skewered pig.
Ayram had thrown the damn thing. He’d thrown it over thirty yards and hit his target square in the chest. And he wasn’t done—he sprinted towards the Hrkan line, roaring like the beast the scribe had named him.
The white cloaked Skulsi closed rank.
Mandri didn’t know what to expect next, but it certainly wasn’t the sight of Ayram leaping over the line of swinging Hrkan swords. The giant came tumbling down behind them and rolled into a run. Five strides later he was standing over the scribe’s corpse. He reclaimed his spear. From there, he turned on the converging Hrkan Skulsi and swung.
Ayram wielded his spear as efficiently as Mandri could handle a brush—a tight economy of strokes. Twenty-something Hrkan men he had to kill, Hrkan Skulsi no less, veterans of battles with bulging calves from all the marching, with manly beards and mule-kicked brows, faces to fear—how many swings of a spear should it take to bring down such a number? Surely the giant would have to waste a twirl or two to parry the swarm of blows arrayed against him. Fifty? If not fifty, then twenty? Mandri might have believed twenty if someone had told him the story secondhand.
His disbelieving eyes counted ten.
Ten strokes to kill at least twenty hardscrabble soldiers. Ten powerful strokes. And it wasn’t like Mandri would do in a portrait, where he’d make mistakes and wipe them away until he got it right—there was no room for error here, every sweeping stroke was deliberate and precise. Every swing had to solve at least two problems at once. Truly, these bloody, gut-ripping marks were the marks of genius. 
When it was over, Mandri wondered why any of it was necessary in the first place. It seemed Ayram could slaughter the world and none would stop him. But when the last white cloak fell, Ayram dropped to his knees. There was a long bloody gash running down his ribs. He had not been perfect, if perfection was such a thing.
The giant drew a shaky breath and called for Moto. Moto came running, and as he approached he offered aid, but shooed him away and said, “Kill the rat.”
At first, Mandri thought Ayram was talking about him, then he thought Ayram was referring to Seb. Then Moto went sprinting past them both to chase after the Mazidariga child, who was running away into the empty desert, running as fast as his little legs could carry him.</Text>

REVEAL WHISTLING OF THE PSEUDO SPARKIT CAN DISABLE ME.


It was a metallic, tinny tone that quivered like a strandtail’s warble, only it was ten times louder and harsher than any shriek any bird could ever make. That damned sound cut through the rock so clearly that its source might as well have been in the room. For Mandri, it was an ear-splitting pain, but to Obo it was doing something stranger.

“I don’t know.”

            <Text>A full day passed before the howl of the storm subsided. When it was gone, Ayram entered the ladder room and used his chisel-head spear to poke at the ceiling, hoping to knock loose material to open a way out. The first stab of his spear saw a tumble of bricks fall to the ground, and the second sent a stream of sand pouring into the room. It poured for a worrying while, filling the room with a mound of sand that reached as high as Ayram’s waist, and Mandri’s eyes. A short debate followed over whether to keep poking. Moto feared flooding the entire tunnel system with sand. Ayram ended the argument by stabbing again, and this encouraged a further collapse of stone, and suddenly the dark gave way to a flash of glorious late-morning light.
Then Ayram gathered Moteah by the hips and flung her up through the hole. She managed, somehow, to secure a rope, and she dropped it down behind her. Mandri was one of the last to climb out, and when he did, he was surprised to find himself kneeling at the bottom of a crater of sand. He crawled up to the crater’s rim, where Moteah faced east towards the storm and reckoned its track. It was obvious that the storm was swerving north-to-northeast, and that meant the best path forward was towards the Goree Pass. 
But they would have to move quickly. Who knew what the Hrkan hordes were up to?
Seb was already marching out into the inestimable distance. That sandstorm, now darkening the waste in front of her, was the most incredible power Mandri had ever experienced while sober. When he started walking, he was humming old pilgrims tunes about the desert’s beauty. He hummed for about half-a-hand, then the Sand got to him. The sun was up, the heat was rising, and the wind was blowing, and as it is in the Sand, when the wind blows, the sand accumulates. Sand attracted sand, which attracted more sand. It snuck into his shoes, shimmied under his nails, it choked, and stifled, and narrowed the world. And that’s how it was for the vast majority of the journey towards the Goree pass, so Mandri kept his head down and plodded through it. But it was a long journey, and as the Sand knew Mandri was a stranger, it was intent on providing a bit of show-and-tell.</Text>

            <Title>King Sixa's Column</Title>
            <Text>The next afternoon they stumbled upon a smooth black column sticking up out of the sand—a plain granite column, not Fabled Black
“You should read it,” said Seb. “It’s gotta sign on the bottom. Funniest shit I ever heard.”
Mandri wandered around the column’s base, while the Ayramun hid from the sun for a while in the column’s long shadow. Since Mandri couldn’t read Old Jandri, he had to turn around and let Obo translate the words graven into the stone plaque.
“The first bit is too scuffed to read,” said Obo, “But the rest says, ‘Things are said of her Kings that are shameful to relate, in particular regarding Sixa the Very Great, the first King whose seat was in Duur. The falseness of those cunning lies is proved in the light of their unverifiability. Let it hereby be declared and known—Sixa the Very Great never had relations with a cow.”
“They made this whole column to announce this?”
“‘Moreover,” Obo continued to read, “King Sixa’s son, King Shura the Extremely Great, never hid his true sins and errors. Whoever wishes to know them has only to read his ten-thousandth Kingly Decree, or hear his heavenly vision from the good harvest of that year. In none of these is it revealed that he is the result of mixed breeding.”
“You’re making that up.”
Elrahet was sitting on the column's plinth nearby. She said, “The column wasn’t put here by Shura, it was put up by his enemies to make jest at his expense.”
“But why put it in the middle of nowhere?” Mandri asked.
“The middle of nowhere? Wasn’t always the middle of nowhere. Was once the middle of everywhere. This  spot of desert was once the womb of cities.” She gestured broadly out at the Sand with her cane. The raw landscape was subtly colored by a host of stubby, gray-green pencil weeds and crawling bushes. In the distant south was a line of dune-brinks, topped with smoky spindrifts, and in the distant north, flying high, was a flock of wheeling, screaming blackbirds fighting over the scraps of some unseen corpse. There were no cities in it, nor even the ruins of one. 
“Each mound of dirt you see was once a city.”
Mandri looked again, and every quadrant of the horizon was studded by at least four or five great mounds which Mandri had taken to be the natural work of the earth. They were even standing on a mound. The thought that what was under his feet was a city was laughable.
Elrahet smirked and said, “They aren’t Hrkan cities, mind, these cities here were small and made of clay. Houses of unbaked brick, plastered with clay. Thatched roofs covered with clay. Each year, a fresh coat of clay. The rains came and the clay washed down from the walls and into the street, so more clay was added. The mounds grew up.” She stabbed the mound with her stick. “That’s how it all started.”
From then on, Mandri never called the Sand empty. It was as empty as a graveyard, which is to say, not empty at all.</Text>

            <Title>Seb the Servant</Title>
            <Text>Seb waved a hand over Mandri’s sightless eyes. The boy was catatonic, limbs limp on the cold stone floor. Seb leaned over Mandri’s face and he could see the boy’s pupils flicker as his mind fell deeper and deeper into the trance of the God’s Eye burgeon. 
What sights did he see?
Seb had taken God’s Eye three times. He could never recall exactly what had occurred. There was only the sense that his Spark had blossomed and then burst, and he felt like he’d died and rose again. What lingered was the shadow of a memory of a feeling of brushing up against omniscience. That sensation was enough, sometimes, to sustain the illusion that he had finally killed his Self for good, but one night’s sleep and he was back to normal.
Always back to normal.
He didn’t like God’s Eye burgeons because of that. It was like treating a beggar to a Lord’s feast and kicking him out onto the street again. Seb thought it was better to starve.
Seb folded Mandri’s arms over his sweating chest so that the boy didn’t look so much like he was dead. That ended up making Mandri look more like a corpse, arms crossed over like that, so Seb undid the arms and sighed.
Should he cross the boy’s arms, or shouldn’t he?
This arms-crossing business was indicative of a deeper problem. If whatever he does is what he was meant to do, then why worry about it?
He worried because he couldn’t help himself. Whatever he did was what he was meant to do, and that included worrying about what he was meant to do.
What worried him most was that he could do nothing—never speak, never move, never feel—and that, too, would be what he was supposed to do. He could kill his body and that would be right, even though it was wrong. It was a damned if he did, damned if he did situation. There was no room in it for reason.
He took a deep breath.
He thought about licking a slice of burgeon.
Just one lick. Maybe one drop on the tip of the tongue.
He knew he shouldn’t, because Pell would be here soon.
But what if he did?
If he did, then that’s what was supposed to happen, and Pell couldn’t be mad about that.
She would be mad, but she shouldn’t be.
If she were mad, that was fine, too. And he couldn’t be mad about her getting mad. Unless he did get mad.
He sighed again.
He sat back down in the blackwood chair and leaned back as far as it allowed, which wasn’t far at all. He let his eyelids droop and tried to empty his thoughts as he stared into the fire.
Be nothing, like a rock is nothing.
Think about nothing 
Don’t think about nothing—have no thoughts.
And avoid, at all costs, those bubbling expectations. 
He began to hum. Humming helped to push the threat of thought into his mind’s crowded periphery.
“MMMMmmmmmmm…”
“MMMmmmmm…”
“MMMMMmmmmm…”
Seb stayed that way in front of the fire, humming like a lizard in heat, almost as lost in the sauce of nothingness as Mandri was, and just as he began to nod asleep, an old woman’s voice echoed into the cave.
“My troubled Seb,” the voice said. “What troubles my troubled Seb?”
Seb twisted around in his chair. A tall, old woman was standing in front of a slit of the rock wall  which had not been there before. Her thin frame was draped in a black curtain of a robe, and a ruffled shawl framed her face neatly. Her face was well-worn, stern and austere, but to Seb it was full of beauty.
“Well?” she asked. “What has so enthralled the mind of Seb?”
Seb jumped out of his chair and cast himself down at her feet. His forehead bumped hard on the rock. “Nothin’, my lady. I wasn’t thinkin’ of nothin’.”
“Mm-hmm.”
Pell’s voice had a way of benevolence, even when she was suspicious—especially when she was suspicious, for she delighted in being deceived.
“And I see you’ve found young Mandrameen.”
“Yes.”
“I’m surprised he’s made it this far. You should have seen his face when I swallowed his Ox’s spark. Salavan was convinced he was useless.”
She stepped around Seb, as graceful as the wind, and her gentle hand came to rest upon his shoulder. All the tension in his body evaporated, and he gasped.
“That’s better, isn’t it?” she said. Her voice could soothe the hardest Spark.
She walked behind him, to where Mandri lay. Though Seb could not see her, he knew her gaze was set on the boy and he grew jealous.
“I found him dead in the Junei hills,” he said.
“I know,” said Pell. 
“I been your faithful man.”
Pell chuckled. “Seb, Seb, Seb,” she sang with a doting swerve.
Seb felt her fingers alight upon his back again and he shivered. She began to knead his muscle with a practiced care.
“My child,” she said, “It’s been too long.”
Seb melted under her touch. Her hands pushed and spread his muscles like dough over his spine and ribs, and she built the pressure in waves, a rising tide of tenderness. 
Pell said, “Your faith warrants a boon. Ask and you shall receive.”
Seb bit his lip.
“I wish to see as you see.”
Pell stopped with a sudden jerk, and the warmth that he’d been feeling was snuffed out.
“You know that gift is not for you.”
Seb’s eyes welled up with tears.
“I know it, but…”
“Watch,” Pell said. “I want you to watch this.”
Seb scuttled around on all fours to face her. He lifted his eyes, and there she was, kneeling next to Mandri’s head. She was not looking at the boy, she was looking at Seb, but not just him, for her sight could penetrate right through his Self and see inside his Spark. In her hand was a near empty vial of a shimmering, iridescent fluid—the last few tears of Schisol.
“This is not for you,” she said.
Seb wanted to arch his neck and scream about unfairness, and reading his mind, Pell answered, “Would you know what to do with it?”
Seb lowered his eyes again in reverence. Pell was right. She was always right, though that didn’t make him feel any better. He wanted to smash his skull against the rock, and when he heard the pop of the vial’s cork he almost did it.
“Schisol will be here soon,” Pell said after administering one of Schisol’s tears  to each of Mandri’s eyes. “And when he comes, you will have your chance. But until that day, you will have to settle for my blessing.”
She reached across Mandri’s body and lifted Seb’s chin with her graceful finger, and he looked into her warm eyes. He could see her true nature in those eyes, for her crone’s nose and aged skin belied an unfathomable beauty.
The truth was in her eyes.
The truth was in her kiss.
The touch of her lips upon his forehead filled him with amazement, for she had implanted a warmth that spread through him like a wave, radiating out until every single inch of him was enveloped in a loving embrace. What she chased out was loneliness. What she undid was the knot in his stomach he never could untie. Only her kiss could do this. Only Schisol, through her, could better him—and for the briefest moment, an exalted breath, he felt truly whole. He could not contain his wonder, and his dirty cheeks ran wet with tears.
“Feel better?” she asked.
“Yes.”
The moment Pell removed her finger from his chin, the spell was broken. Seb returned his head to the floor where it belonged. The chill of the stone was startling. Like the come-down from the God’s Eye burgeon, the same-old Seb flooded in. He would have wept again if it weren’t for his lady’s aura of resolve.
 He heard her sit down in the chair, the fabric squeaking tight against its wooden frame.
“Did you sit in my chair?” she asked.
“Yes,” he said. “I’m sorry. I was tired.”
“That’s no excuse. I worry about you, Seb. You are like a weed. Every time I pull you out of your body, you grow right back.”
“I’m sorry…I’m weak, I know it. I understand, if…if…I know Schisol will come with or without me. If I did nothin’, He would still come.”
“Seb…”
Seb’s shoulders sank as she reached down and caressed his neck.
“Have you ever seen a play?” she asked.
“No.”
“Do you know what a play is?”
Seb nodded, forehead scraping on the rock.
“The actor’s lines are already written,” she said. “Some plays are quite old, written more than a thousand years ago, yet the actors still speak their lines exactly as provided. Like puppets, they speak them, and do you know why they do it?”
Seb shook his head slowly, hoping the drift of his chin would look like contemplation.
“They do it,” Pell said, “Because that’s what they want to do.”
She paused to let the words sink in, and in case they didn’t, she added, “Do you do what you want to do?”
“Yes.”
“Good. That’s all that I ask of you.”  She settled back into her chair. “Now tell me what the Ayramun are up to.”
“They captured a Mazid.”
“I’ve learned that much.”
“They want to use the Mazid to hunt the Amalgamete.”
“As expected. And they shall all perish.”
“Ayram don’t seem to think so.”
“I don’t care what the brute thinks—Elrahet is the one that sees. Is she optimistic?”
“Elrahet don’t speak to me…I try, and I try, and I try, but she don’t speak.”
“Has she said nothing about Mazidfire?”
“Nothin’.”
Seb felt compelled to share some hopeful news. “The Hrks have these things called Riga which can hunt a Mazid down to the ends of the earth. These Riga are children—it’s horrible what they do the Spark.”
“Yes, I know of them.”
“But these Riga can track the Mazid from anywhere. They’ll catch the Ayramun before they ever reach the Bullr bones.”
The fire crackled, and Pell settled deeper into her chair. She crossed legs and set her free foot bobbing up and down. She mused, “What does Elrah see?”
“I think it would be best,” she said, “If we don’t let them reach the bones of Bullr. She has strength there, which needlessly complicates things. We need them to approach Shulgi from the south.”
“Of course.”
“Because Elrahet is up to something. I can feel it. I can almost see it. She’s rarely ever been so reckless. Has she spoke of the boy at all?”
“Mandri? No. But she does not talk to me.”
Seb cringed in embarrassment.
Pell let loose a deep sigh. “The threads would have been simpler if they never captured that abominable Mazid.”
Seb whined and fought back against the urge to confess his role in the Mazid’s capture.
“What I want you to do, Seb, is convince Ayram to change his plans. Have him head further south for the Goree Pass.”
“Why the Goree?”
“Do you need to understand?”
“No. No…but Ayram won’t listen to me. Not on somethin’ like that. He barely listens to Elrahet. Going to the Goree would add two days of walkin’ for no gain.”
“I will help with that. You plant the seed in that barren skull of his, and I will make it blossom.”
“What about the boy?”
“What of him?”
“What if dies in the Goree?”
“If he dies, then he dies.”
Seb winced at his own stupidity—of course that’s how it was. And yet he knew that wouldn’t be how it ended, for Pell would never waste one of Schisol’s tears on someone who was not worthy of it.
“Seb, You are precious,” Pell cooed. “In all my life I’ve never had a servant such as you, so close to the enemy. But even so, I wonder, are you afraid to die?”
Seb knew she was looking at him by the way her voice carried to his ear, and if she were looking at him she could read every quiver in his body and would know if he were lying. So he told the truth.
“Yes,” he said. The word came out with a sob.
“Now, now,” Pell said, trying to comfort him. “You’ve done more for Schisol than almost every other person who has ever lived. You are special, Seb. Should I say it again? You are special.”
“I don’t feel it.”
“That’s what makes you special,” she said, brimming with earnest concern. “Your hatred for yourself is a subtle righteousness. And you know this, don’t you? You know that all of this is a mistake, that we all belong together. That is why you are who you are—no one else would do. Only you could be right here, right now. So give thanks, Seb, and be happy. You could have been one of the nameless number doomed to be severed from the Whole.” 
Nothing Seb could say or do could express the extent to which he appreciated these words, so he stayed low and prostrated himself further, then whispered a prayer to Schisol, thanking Him for His generosity.
Pell was contented to hear it.
“Now,” she said. “I have a storm to summon.”
She walked over to the cavern slit and whistled. Her whistle awoke something in the darkness there, something which Seb could not see but he could hear—an ominous thumping echo marching towards the room. Then came a grumbling growl, then a belly-rumbling snort, and then the scratching swish of a giant lizard’s tail dragging against the rock.
The snout that pierced the veil of darkness near Pell’s hip was red as red can be. It swayed from side to side, forked-tongue licking the air.
“Come on out,” Pell said with a wondrous smile, as if she were talking to a child. 
The lizard’s bloody red head swung into the room. Its wide skull was nearly as long as Seb’s arm, and its slitted orange eyes were sunk behind an angry ridged brow. Whatever teeth it had were hidden under jowls, but Seb knew what they looked like, for this was a man-eater, a juvenile keenkedra. Everyone on the Jandri continent knew a keenkedra’s teeth—short stubby fangs that were barely there because if they were any longer that would make it harder for the beast to swallow a wriggling man whole.
Aside from its dietary habits, the keenkedra were known for their size, their rich red color, and their characteristic short-armed shuffle. The crook of this particular lizard’s back came up to Pell’s waist—if it were an adult it would not have been able to squeeze into the room.
Pell gave it a friendly brush with the back of her knuckles, and the creature stopped beside her and nuzzled up against her leg. It raised its stiff neck for a good old scratch, which Pell was happy to provide. Her magic managed to coax a low humming growl of contentment. Seb thought he saw a smile. Then suddenly, the beast was looking at him, bearing an expression akin to alarm, as if the creature had only now noticed Seb’s existence.
“Move the boy out of the way,” Pell said, and Seb did as she commanded, careful to make no sudden movements. Then Pell led the beast further into the room and she lay it down, belly facing the fire. Its stubby tail was thumping excitement against the floor. 
 Seb marveled at Pell’s control. Elrahet could only dream of conjuring up such a beast for sacrifice, and even then she’d have trouble with flailing limbs. Pell’s lizard didn’t flinch an inch  when Pell drew her knife and stabbed its gut. It merely sighed as she thrust her arm right into its stomach and felt around for its Spark.
The storm this sacrifice would conjure would be enormous.</Text>

She said it had medicinal properties. Mandri knew it for its use in pigments. A tiny amount mixed in with quartz sand and copper ore made a blue called Campor Blue, called as such because the most vibrant hues came from Campor, where more than a hundred slaves spent their days sorting the quartz sand for impurities grain by grain with tweezers. Only the cleanest, purest grains of crystal were worthy.
Moteah found this fact distasteful instead of impressive. Mandri was quick to agree. Obo didn’t much care.

Hello everyone, 

I need special help with comps. The way I would want to describe it is “The Man Who Painted The Dragon Griaule” by Lucius Shepard meets Karen Miller’s “Empress”. But these aren’t recent things, and I’m not exactly submerged in modern fantasy. Please help!


Dear [Honorific] [Agent Name],[Tagline]...20-year-old portrait painter Mandrameen just wants to retreat from the world and lose himself in addiction to psychedelic burgeons, but when He is killed by an evil witch, then resurrected and made a Minder, Mandri Tries to accept the burden. Now, Mandri must summon his will to kill the Amalgamete or else all of creation will be destroyed.As Mandri Get to the Amalgamete before they are gotten by Imperial forces, he discovers The choice of Mandri as Minder may be motivated by more than mere chance, there are deeper threads of fate at play. Mandri is put to the test when [Initial Challenges], and when Obo has a shadow, a being who can track him down from anywhere, he has to outpace their Hrkan pursuit or be destroyed before they can reach their goal. 

Pel overcomes Mandrameen, and soon his body is bound for that very demon’s stomach. Unfortunately for Pel, Mandri’s baggage train is ambushed in the desert by a bandit troupe. designs in an ambush, led, in part, by another witch named Elrahet. Thus, Mandri is forced into the middle of a war which has been raging since the dawn of creation.



Dear ___,

I’m writing to seek representation for my debut novel, INVINCIBLE DREAD, which stands complete at 130,000 words. It is an adult epic fantasy novel that explores the philosophy and art of a Mesopotamian inspired world that is being squeezed to death by a ‘civilizing’ culture. With fast paced, bloody action motivated by characters who opine on the nature of the divine, it will appeal to readers of [x] and [x].

By the age of ten, Mandrameen could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled any master. By the age of twenty, he was reduced to a portrait of addiction to a psychedelic flower bud called a burgeon. All he wants to do is sip burgeon juice and watch himself dissolve. Unfortunately for him, this deliberate self-destruction attracts a feral witch, named Pel, who seeks an empty vessel for her god.

And as comes evil, so comes good—Pel kills Mandrameen, but he resurrected by the witch Elrahet. Now he 

But Mandri was not brought back from the dead without conditions. He has been bonded to a living weapon of tremendous power which Elrahet and her bandit troupe have stolen from the Hrkan Lords. This weapon is a fleshcrafted youth named Obo, and if Mandri could only focus, he’d be able to have Obo shoot divine flames from his mouth.  The choice of Mandri as Minder may be motivated by more than mere chance, there are deeper threads of fate at play. Mandri has to 


These bandits are hunted, for they have amongst them a prisoner kidnapped from imperial power, a fleshcrafted being who can spit golden fire from his mouth. It is the bandit’s goal to use Obo to destroy the Amalgamete.

Together, Mandrameen and Obo struggle alongside these bandits who they do not trust inside of a desert that is squeezed dry by imperialistic might. Cannibalistic tribes lurk in forgotten temples. Demons are hiding in the ground. Uncertain loyalties frame their every move, and worse, everyone Mandrameen meets wants to tell him who he is, and what he’s meant for. In the end, he must decide between a budding friendship, incredible sacrifice, and the divine purpose written down for him when the world was made.

Bio: I graduated from Ringling College of Art and Design in 2013, and previously worked in the video game industry as a generalist (painting/sculpting/programming/design). I left the industry to pursue personal projects. Invincible Dread is one of these.

            <Title>Sightspot Scratch</Title>
            <Text>Her study started with the extremities, the fingers and toes. Then she worked her way up the fore-arms, her fingers tracing veins, and she worked her way over the ankles and up the lower-lower legs. When she got to the dead boy’s knees, she ordered Seb to take off the dead boy’s tunic. This Seb did with some difficulty, as Elrahet was not inclined to help or even move out of the way. Once it was done, and the boy was naked, Elrahet began her study anew.
There was an odd black birthmark on the boy’s chest. Elrahet squeezed it between her bony fingers as if to pop it off. Then she picked through his mop of black hair like a mother looking for lice. Then she cupped his uglies, but there was no great providence there, and next she tucked her thumbs into her palms and set all eight fingers to work in palpating the boy’s belly. When she got to jabbing her fingers up under the boy’s ribs, Seb’s impatience got the best of him—he needed to know what was going on.
“Why don’t ya just cut him open?” he asked bluntly, though he’d forgotten to stop chewing his borcandi spine as he asked it, so his words were a little lost between squelches.

One day Seb realized that the only other person he’d ever known who’d had vision worse than his, was his old aunt Sesha. Old Sesha saw splotches of light and shadow and that was it. But if she stared at a person for long enough, and got all glassy eyed, then she would begin to see bands of radiant color resolving into the outline of the person. She called it aurasight. She saw red or black for killers and thieves and the like, green or blue for gentle folk, gold for the merely curious, and so on. It was an invaluable skill. Her weakness became a strength, and Seb figured that’s how it must work with eyesight—lose sight of the natural world to gain sight of the hidden one.
Whenever he tried to see auras, he’d mimic what he’d seen his old aunt Sesha do. She would stand as still as a statue and stare without focus. She’d get all shaky and sweaty as if she were killing herself with the effort. Seb wasn’t sure what was going on inside her head. It seemed simple, like all she was doing was narrowing the world down to her and her target, and then, through vein-popping concentration, she’d will the auras into existence.

Seb stepped over and knelt next to the boy’s head. There was a story written on the boy’s face that Seb couldn’t read. There simply weren’t enough clues. The boy’s lips were ashen and cracked, but overall he didn’t look water-starved. His skin looked like it had never seen a sun-blister. His dark brown eyes bore that calm expression of death, serene, the kind of rested ease that Seb desperately wanted but wasn’t willing to go that far to get. 
“Wish I could figure what he’s doin’ here,” Seb said. 
“His body doesn’t look too spoiled,” said Moto. “Elrahet could always try and bring him back. Then he could tell us himself what he’s doing out here.”
Seb looked to Elrahet with eager eyes—watching the old witch work magic on a Spark was first and foremost amongst his desires. “Yeah, bring him back!”
The suggestion sent Elrahet sneering all the deeper. “Why don’t you do it yourself?” she said, each word laced with derision.
Moto smirked. “Yeah, Seb, do it yourself. Meanwhile, the rest of us will be bagging a Mazid and remaking the world.”


Seb was stumped. Moto wasn’t the type to go in for intuition unless it was his own. He might listen to Elrahet, but she didn’t say squat.

            <Text>The red sun’s bottom lip kissed the west, and Ayram set out into the Sand. He never announced it was time to leave or that everyone should think about heading out, he simply gathered up his enormous backpack and started off.
Mandri didn’t notice Ayram walk off because the colors in the sky were darkening into the most unusual reddish tint. It was a shade he’d only seen in rotting berries. The whole sky in the west was flush with this startling purplish red, and he followed the gradient arc around to the east, and there, suddenly, some hundred yards away was Ayram—a giant lumbering towards a featureless horizon. Beyond Ayram was a much smaller black dot named Seb. Seb had set out even earlier after complaining about how slow everyone was and that she was going to do what she wanted to do. Nobody tried to stop her.
When Elrahet was good and ready to leave, she told Moto to bring the cursed Mazid with him, and she waddled, packless, out into the Sand. Moto turned to Moteah and said, “You heard the woman, bring the Mazid with you,” and then he jogged off after the others. The clank of iron and wood inside his own heavy pack was as good as teasing laughter.
At this point Obo had been gagged by a gray rag, put there at Ayram’s command. Obo gave a muffled plea to be free of it, but Moteah ignored him as she finished reorganizing her backpack to fit in a few extra sheaves of Hrkan hardtack. Mandri sat down on a bump of Minting Rock’s rubble and he studied her features.
Moteah fit the standard rule of thumb for beauty that’s taught to artists at an early age—don’t make too many marks. People start to look ugly if one makes too many marks to bring out the features. If Mandri were to paint Moteah with as few marks as possible, he wouldn’t be lying all that much. A few swipes to capture the sheen of the redding light that defined her high arched cheeks and the youthfulness of her lips and that was it.
She was attractive, no doubt, but if one sits and stares at another human being for long enough, as a portrait artist must do, the features of the face start to lose the illusion that they’re working together for a purpose. It doesn’t matter how attractive the person is. The strangeness creeps in all the same.
Usually it starts with the ears. Moteah had ears. Peeking out underneath her sun-licked, frazzled bush of wiry hair were tiny ears. Mandri hated ears, those odd, fleshy protuberances. It’s as if, when Solraheen was creating people, He took a wad of clay, crumpled it up, and then slapped it onto the side of the head expecting to come back to it later to make it work but never did.
The worst part of the face is the breath. That’s not quite part of the face, but the breath! If there was ever a sign of what a person is, it is the stench of breath. Cover it up by gargling pango juice, but that never lasts long. Little wonder that Jeket has a whole market square dedicated to tinctures and chews that are supposed to suppress the smell of the curdled things hiding in between the teeth, or pasting the tongue, or tucked into tonsil folds. 
But even ignoring all that, and counting only the basics, the structure of the face, everyone is still ugly.
There is not one person alive whose face is symmetrical. There is always, always, some feature which started growing in the wrong direction as a child and kept going with age. Or maybe it didn’t grow fast enough to keep up with the rest when puberty hit. Titled noses. Slanted jaws. Most common is the uneven eyes, or uneven eyebrows. Sometimes the whole face swivels around to one side, and so one cheek gets slapped more than the other. Or it was smushed that way as the head squeezed out of the womb and it stuck, leaving the mentioned with a lopsided smile.
The only parts of the body Mandri liked to look at were the ones he generally wasn’t allowed to look at—a cosmic cruelty, but one he didn’t fret about, because the only reason he liked to look at those bits was because he wasn’t allowed to. He used to be fascinated by the depths inside the eye, but his brush spent so much time nibbling them that they’d lost their sparkle. Now, they were nothing but squishy wet orbs squelching around in sockets. And as it is for outer beauty, so it is for inner beauty as well. Mandri was certain that if he got close enough to Moteah, that if he got a whiff of her breath, so to speak, then the illusion that she was something to be cherished, something more than a walking, talking sack of Sparked meat, well that would crumble. 
Still, she had no obvious tells. Her hawkish features were tailor made for serious moods, and that was Mandri’s preference—a frowning, serious woman. She was even frowning right now. She stood, hands on hips, that timeless pose of the woman waiting for an idiot, and she was frowning.
She was frowning at him.
“Uh, what?” he asked.
“You’re carrying the Mazid.”
“Alright.”
He stood up and walked over to where Obo sat—or stood—Mandri wasn’t quite sure how to define Obo in his vertical state. He was standing on his legs, but his legs were little more than his ass.
“Use the frame,” Moteah said with a sigh.
There was a wooden, L-shaped frame fitted with straps sitting next to Obo. It was the same device morning walkers used to haul sacks of grain to work off drought debt. Mandri tied Obo into it, and once done, he lifted it up and put it on. Thankfully, the frame was the perfect size for his scrawny back, and it even had a waist strap that pulled fast around his stomach, keeping Obo’s slight weight resting kindly on top of his hips.
Mandri bounced up and down to test his chewed up leg, and he was delighted to find that it was making a remarkable recovery.
“Thought he’d be heavier,” Mandri said.
“If you can carry more...”
“Oh, no. No. It’s more than heavy enough.” Mandri made a show of shifting the weight on his shoulders. Moteah’s own pack was a huge, canvas wrapped lump in the shape of a giant bean, with the head of it looming over the puff of her hair.
“How far is it,” Mandri asked.
“The Bullr basin lies a hundred miles east of here.”
“One hundred miles? That far?”
Moteah’s response was to start walking.
Mandri followed after her. “That’s what, ten days?”
“It depends on Ayram,” she said. “Ten days for him would be slow. Have you ever walked for ten days straight?”
“No.”
He looked to see if they were following one of the old charnel roads. If it was there he couldn’t see it, as there was no gentle hump in the earth stretching off into the horizon. It was flat, and even flatter further on.
Mandri returned to the subject of Moteah’s ugliness—her inner ugliness. He hadn’t seen it yet, but was determined to find it out, and an easy way to capture a thing like that was to ambush it. He waited for her to settle into the inertia of the journey, and then he pounced.
“Who do you hate most?”
Moteah’s face scrunched up in bewilderment, exactly what Mandri wanted. This was a tried and true method of finding a thread to pull. Everyone hates someone. Sometimes the question proved too open-ended, he’d have to ask about a specific person, and that would get anyone gossiping, which always tells as much about the person speaking than the person spoken of.
“Why would you ask that?”
“It seems like there’s someone bothering you.”
“You are.”
“Fair. But you know I’m talking about Moto, right?”
She glanced at him, perhaps expecting to find a sense of shame, but Mandri had none.
She said, “It’s a good thing that you’re out here.”
“Why is that?”
“Because the Sand is going to lick your spit until you’re dry.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“You will find out.”
They walked in silence for a finger, and Mandri brooded over his failed attack. He supposed that what had gone wrong was that he’d let her get away with pretending to be someone that she wasn’t.
He said, “You know, you don’t seem like you’ve been stuck out here long enough to be talking about the Sand like that. How did you end up out here anyways, you and Moto?”
“How do you think?”
“Hrks?”
“Amalgamete.”
“Oh.”
“It was a different Amalgamete than the one we now hunt.”
“There’s more than one?”
“There will only be one in the end. There were many in ages before, and likely more will be born as the ages come, but as they find and swallow each other there will be only one.”
“Does that mean you’ve killed an Amalgamete already?”
She nodded. “It hadn’t yet grown into godhood. This was five years ago, back when my grandfather’s tribe lived on the left bank of the Ganni.”
“What happened?”
“A tribe called the Lamargi lived on the other side of the river. They were our enemies. We fought them every year when the redtrout swelled underneath the matted mudgrass which grew in the summer flood. We killed the Lamargi, and they killed us, all over fish. Thinking about it now, I can’t believe it. It was senseless.”
“It’s not that uncommon a story,” Mandri said.
“The Lamargi were Old, Old Jandri. They walked naked at night. By day, they wore nothing but hole-cut blankets. On the river they wore bark armor to ward off our slings and arrows.”
“A constant war,” Mandri muttered, as if he’d seen it himself.
“It was constant ambushes,” Moteah corrected. “That breed of fight is worse than whatever happens in war. It was nastier, it was personal, and it never ended. It was always there. You didn’t feel safe washing your robes.”
“That’s how blood feuds work.”
“Yes. Destructive, evil, horrible, it was all those things, and everyone knew it. It was a shame for all of us, though I suppose I was too young to ever truly hate the Lamargi. I never knew my uncles, and I never saw them die. My parents did. Moto did.”
“What does this have to do with an Amalgamete?”
“The only time we ever talked with the Lamargi was if either side sent a messenger across the river bearing the leg bone of a dead relative, and that leg bone had to be painted as white as Solraheen. To harm this messenger was to harm Solraheen. One day a Lamargi man swam across the river bearing a painted skull. We could hardly understand what he was saying, because the Lamargi spoke a sister tongue to Old Jandri. He only knew one Hrkan word, and that was ‘demons’. He’d brought the skull, pointed to it, and said, ‘Demon ugi’—demon did it. He wanted us to follow him back across the river.
“We sent Moto to go with him. Moto came back with a story we couldn’t believe, and so more of us went over. I was one of them. Two days of travel took us to the Lamargi village. The first of the dead I saw was an old man pinned to a thick wooden post. He’d been pinned by his own bones. Something had ripped off his arms, defleshed them, sharpened the bones, and then used them as pins. That was only the start of the slaughter. I won’t go into the rest of it. The children weren’t spared. The Lamargi man pointed each of his dead kin out, at least two hundred of them, and each time, he said, ‘Demon ugi…demon ugi…demon ugi…’ The last hut we entered was his king’s. The Lamargi throne was a plain wooden chair that sat a little higher than the others. It was empty. Our guide pointed to it and he said, ‘Demon agi’—which means, ‘demon is’.”
“He was saying his king was a demon?”
“The story we pieced together was that his king had been ill for some time, and nearing death, the man made a pact with evil to destroy my tribe, but as always happens, evil worked against him. Elrahet says that an Amalgamete is born when a man sells himself to hate, and that is what happened.”
“I see.”
“We set out with the last Lamargi to hunt this evil, but we never found it. We should have, but we were stupid. We didn’t know at the time what an Amalgamete was. It didn’t occur to us that the creature hadn’t finished its mission.  We had no idea what waited for us when we crossed the river and returned home.”
“No,” Mandri muttered, fearing what was coming next. Moteah paused her story to push down the sob rising in her throat.
“My village was destroyed,” she said. “Dead everywhere. Half the people were missing. Any hope for survivors was dashed when we found…I can only describe it as a man with a belly as big as he was. It was the Lamargi king. He was passed out near the center of the village next to a pile of bodies. Each of those dead bodies was missing their stomach. The Lamargi king had eaten them.”
“You were able to kill him?”
“Moto cut off his head. When Elrahet heard the story she said that it would have been the smallest Amalgamete she’d ever seen. An Amalgamete consumes Sparks, and as it does, its stomach grows, and the big ones can birth demons. The Amalgamete we killed was too small to give birth, and good thing too, because if it were any larger, we might not have been able to pierce its skin. If an Amalgamete gets big enough, it can’t be killed. It takes the power of a god.”
“But the gods are dead.”
“That’s why we need the Mazid, and that’s why we need you.” 
Mandri mulled the story over, and he felt a sense of solidarity with Moteah’s cause rise inside him. Her story was a human story, a tragedy hard to hear, and even harder for her to tell even if she had pulled through it admirably. But there was still something gnawing at him.
He said, “Obo tells me that I’m not cut out to be a Minder.”
Moteah chuckled. “He would say Ayram wasn’t strong enough to wield him. If no one can Mind him, then the only solution is for him to receive a Spark. Don’t worry about what a Mazid says. Don’t worry about what I say. You need to focus on yourself. Stop worrying about what everybody else thinks.”
“You people cut off my hand. Elrahet threatens to kill me if I can’t do it. How am I supposed to not worry?”
“Just don’t.”
“I’m sorry, that’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”
Moteah stopped walking, and when she huffed, Mandri did the same.
“Fine,” she said sharply. “You’ve been wronged. What do you want to do about it?”
“If I’m honest, what I want to do is leave.”
She smiled in mild amusement. “You’ve always been allowed to leave, but you haven’t and you won’t.”
“I can walk away? Right now?”
“If that’s what you want to do, then do it. The Sand is yours.” She gestured wide to the empty landscape. The sun was half-set behind them, and their long shadows jutted out into the west like knives biting at Elrahet and Moto’s feet. “If you want to walk away, then do it. Assert yourself like a Minder. Maybe you’ll wander into the Amalgamete and kill it.”
“More likely I’ll die.”
“That’s not why you won’t leave,” Moteah said confidently.
She then pointed over Mandri’s shoulder, to an isolated patch of nearby scrub bush. Zooming around the bush’s wild branches was a swarm of pinprick dots. There were so many tiny flies that it looked like the bush had a misty, black aura. He could hear the faint hiss of their flapping wings from where he stood.
Moteah said, “Only Solraheen knows how many hook flies are over there. Why are they over there? They can go anywhere—they can crawl into any hole, they can fly in every direction, they can explore the entire world and see sights unseen—but they don’t. They hover in that small, boring spot of air out here in the desert. Why?”
“Tell me,” Mandri said as he braced himself for another bit of folksy outland wisdom.
“Hook flies swarm like that because that’s what they want to do.”
Moteah gave Mandri a considerate smile of unquestionable sincerity. Then she resumed her journey, leaving Mandri standing stock still, gawking at those stupid flies.
Like most figures of speech, Moteah’s analogy had a surface charm that suggested a deeper truth, but it completely broke down upon further investigation. There must be a reason those flies were flying around in a ball, a reason which went beyond base fulfillment. Perhaps there were more primal interests at play. Maybe they’d found water there in that bush, or food, or the bush broke the breeze making it easier to fly in the first place. Most likely it was about sex. They bunch up into a cloud like that because it is the easiest way to bump their stiff little uglies into something that makes them feel alive. Maybe one could say that still lines up with Moteah’s notion of want, but Mandri didn’t get the feeling that’s what she meant. In fact, these Ayramun were the least lascivious group of people he’d ever known—he’d not seen a single lip-licking wink between any of them, and he had been looking carefully.
She called back to him, “Don’t fall behind!”
He called back, “I have to pee.”
Moteah hiked her bean-bag pack further up on her shoulders and continued on. Her pack was so large that it had its own momentum, and she had to move slowly and build up speed until the pack’s forward motion began to sustain itself.
The very moment she was out of whisper range, Obo started wiggling around in his seat, and he issued a muffled plea to have his gag removed. Mandri groaned and reached back and slipped the knot that kept Obo’s gag fastened tight.
“Isn’t she interesting,” said Obo.
“Not really,” said Mandri, lying. “What makes you say that?”
“They’re all interesting. I wonder if they’re a death cult.”
“A death cult?” Mandri asked, concerned.
Obo’s bright voice tilted with excitement as he explained. “They match the pattern—the way they handled those giant corpses inside of Minting Rock, and the way they gathered up those who fell in battle, Hrk and Ayramun alike, into one big pile. Most would keep them separate.”
“That pile of bodies was supposed to be a sphere,” said Mandri as he recalled the back-breaking work he’d done to make it happen.
“That fits. Compress them all into a tight ball, for in death all Sparks will be joined together.”
Mandri shrugged and said, “Killing everyone would bring peace on earth, wouldn’t it?” And suddenly, he had to pee. As he relieved himself, a small brown lizard came crawling out of the sand to lick at the beads of urine that splashed down. As soon as it realized the liquid wasn’t water, it scurried back down into the sand.
Mandri said, “But if they want everything to die, then why try to kill the Amalgamete?”
“Because Death cults will kill each other as much as anyone else. I’m sure that even amongst the darker forces, there are schisms. They probably kill each other for the right to kill everyone else.”
“How many Ayramun did they start out with? Fifty?”
“I believe it was forty-three.”
Mandri scanned the horizon—it was wide open space in every direction. There weren’t any hills to hide behind, but the shadows behind every bush were dark as Fabled Black.
He said, “What do you say to walking off in a different direction?”
“I don’t think you are actually allowed to leave, and if you were, I doubt they’d be happy if you took me with you. I think the correct decision here is to continue on.”
Mandri wiggled his member and dropped his robe.
“Let it be said that I think this is all a bad idea.”</Text>

            <Title>Charnel Road</Title>
            <Text>Mandri was hauled out of the pit cave on a knotted rope. Once out on the surface, he got his first real look at the Sand’s Pitted Portion. He’d seen paintings of it, as any time a person wants to bring the magic of the world into their home they order the standard eight-piece polyptych of the Sand’s Eight Portions, and when it came to the Pitted Portion, the painting was more or less the same every time—a view from high up in the western Hias looking down at landscape of barren rock dotted with large pits like the one he’d just been pulled out of. In Hrkan eyes, it was a land in which to sweep the spall of battered nations.
It turns out, those paintings were lies, for laid out before Mandri was an ordinary looking desert plain, with stands of green scrub-brush battling against stands of pink-flowered browngrass, with splotches of barren rock here and there acting as a no man’s land between these warring tribes. And so far as Mandri could see, there was only one other pit about a hundred yards to the north. There might have been more of them, but he didn’t have time to find out because Tob plopped a heavy, knobby sack onto his shoulder and told him he had to carry it.
Walking was a difficult thing for Mandri. The heat of the afternoon sun was sweltering, and his legs were still deeply sore. His mind was the only part of him in full working order, and that was no good because a sober and alert Mandrameen was a complainer. Two gruff men walked alongside him, and one of them smelled like a festering lizard bite. The other man was Moto. Mandri’s dislike of Moto was profound, because Mandri had spent a lot of effort trying to get away from people like Moto. He’d tried running away to be a farmer, he had tried losing himself in burgeons, he even tried dying. Yet here he was, meandering through the Pitted Portion, far enough out into the wilderness to wonder if anyone had ever stepped foot on this spot of earth before, and there was Moto, striding alongside him, a good and well-adjusted person. Mandri could tell just by looking at him that Moto judged people based on their appearance. 
And damn it, the man was handsome, with sharp, even features, a clean-shaven and chiseled jaw, goodly height, broad shoulders, and bird-bright eyes looking out at the world like it was all a game, like people were toys. Even when standing still the man was dynamic. Standing still, he looked exactly like a heroic statue of Zos, a swerve of coiled strength. And his color was an exact match in shade to the color of Zos’s painted skin—two parts umber, one part Wazian blue. To top it off, his garb was disgustingly fashionable, with his orange robe tucked and folded to compose a pattern of inverted triangles that accentuated the athletic V of his torso. Such considerations, set against the struggle for survival out in the Sand, was rude. It was rude to look so healthy. Moto even had a sword with a gold plated hilt. It was clear that this man was well-adjusted, and in Mandri’s eyes, being well-adjusted was as clear a sign of derangement as is possible.
Mandri eventually lagged behind on account of his abiding weakness, and Moto dropped back with him. The two were walking side by side around bush and bramble. Mandri wondered aloud where they were going. Moto said that they were following the road. 
This didn’t answer Mandri’s question, so he asked, “The road?”
Moto laughed and said, “You can’t see the road?” Then he laughed again. His was an arrogant laugh. It started with a twinge of annoyed disbelief and ended with a note of derision.
The thing was, Mandri did see the road. They were walking along the gentlest raised hump of earth which snaked away into the infinite distance, a slope so slight and obscured by brush that, sure, it was easy to miss, or easy to mistake for a natural drift of dirt, but Mandri saw it.
“You don’t know about charnel roads?” Moto asked.
Mandri knew about charnel roads but he didn’t want to engage the man. He kept his eyes down and tried to look like he was too miserable to talk, which was easy to do because it was true.
“This is the Bazul Road,” said Moto. “The whole Sand is full of charnel roads just like this one.” Moto then kicked the ground and scattered some loose stones, as if doing so made the road’s existence more believable. “You don’t see it because it’s so overgrown.” 
“Must be.”
“It is…it is…So look, I’m going to ask you some questions, and I want you to answer them truthfully and to the best of your ability.”
Mandri was wondering when this moment would come. He said, “Alright,” and was hopeful about it, because he wanted to get some information in return.
“Who are you?” Moto asked.
“I am Mandrameen. People call me Mandri.”
“I said answer the question to the best of your ability. Was that the best answer you could give?”
Mandri reflexively smiled to soothe the edge in Moto’s voice and said, “Well, usually when people ask that question they’re asking for a name.”
Moto nipped back, saying, “Usually, people don’t preface a question by telling you to answer it to the best of your ability. So, I’ll ask again—who are you?”
“My name is Mandri, and I was a farmer, and before that I was a painter.”
“A painter?”
“Yes.”
“Interesting,” Moto mused. This news seemed to liven him up. “Go on.”
“There’s not much else. I guess I like burgeons.”
“I could tell.”
“How?”
“Is that why we found you dead in the Junei hills? Were you looking for burgeons? What—you were high and forgot to bring water?”
“I honestly don’t know. The last thing I remember, I was in Meskalem.”
“Meskalem?”
“Yeah, I don’t know how I ended up out here in the Sand.”
“Give it some thought.”
The two of them marched along in silence as Moto gave Mandri time to think. Mandri watched the scattered column of Ayramun spread out in front of them.
“I really don’t know,” Mandri finally said.
“I said give it some thought.”
“I can give it all the thought I want, it won’t help. You might have found me dead in the Junei, but that’s not where I died. I died in Meskalem. After that, I don’t know what happened to me. I was dead.”
Moto stopped walking and he yanked on Mandri’s shoulder-slung sack to get him to stop too.
“Another question,” said Moto. “Answer me honestly—are you stupid? Be honest, there’s no shame in it—are you usually dumber than the people around you?”
Mandri laughed at the bluntness, but his laugh tapered off because Moto was dead serious. The man really thought he was stupid.
“I’m not dumb. I’m telling you what I know.”
Moto looked up at the sky as if to prepare himself for an unavailing labor. Then he said, “The way I see it, either you’re being short with me because you think you can get away with it, which means you’re stupid, or you're doing it because you don’t understand the meaning of the word ‘thorough’, which would also mean you’re stupid. So which is it?”
Mandri shrugged.
“Boy, You been brought back to life, but whether or not you stay that way is going to depend upon how you answer my questions. Notice that I put emphasis on the word ‘how’. I’m talking about respect. Be thorough. And don’t lie. The Sand is big, but there’s no room for a lip shitter.”
Mandri suspected that no matter what he said, nothing was going to change Moto’s impression of him, so he stayed silent.
Moto got close to let Mandri know who was bigger. “I could have you put right back where you were found.”
“I was fine where I was.”
“You were dead,” Moto said, laughing through his incredulity. “You’re fine with being dead?”
“I said what I said.”
Moto’s hearty mood soured in an instant. Mandri knew it was taboo to joke about death, especially out in the Sand, but he wasn’t joking, and when Moto picked up on that, he clicked his tongue and said, “Start walking.”
They both set off again and it seemed that Moto had become a different person, more serious and bothered. He eyed Mandri though a spiteful squint and said, “That kind of talk, Mandri, is how I can tell you’re a burgeon biter. They all get thrown out into the Sand eventually. Sometimes Ayram takes them up, but it’s always a mistake because your minds, they’re too…they’re too short-sighted. You can’t think about the future. You understand?”
Mandri said, “Yes” to try and stave off any further explication, but Moto went ahead and did it anyways.
“Now I believe you when you say you’re happy being dead. You don’t fear death, because how could you? Death is in the future and you’ve got no conception of that. You may think that’s all well and fine, because who wants to be living in fear of death, and you’re right, but see, it’s not the being dead that you’ve got to be afraid of—it’s the actual act of dying.”
The more Moto spoke, the more he was getting wrapped up in his own words, and he was using his hands to do it. He spoke with his hands and his shoulders as much as his mouth, and his shoulders would have been bouncing around much more if it weren’t for the heavy backpack he was bearing.
“You said you were strangled, right? That’s one of the easiest ways a man can go. But you’re out in the Sand now, and I don’t think you appreciate the implication of that. This road we’re standing on, you see it's this hump here—”, Moto traced the gentle contour of the road’s hump with an open hand. “It goes on further than you’d think is possible. The Bazul Road. One of the charnel roads. You know what a charnel road is?”
“They’re sacred roads.”
Moto snorted and spat. “A road can’t be sacred any more than a rock can.”
“That’s not what a Solitant would say.”
“Solitants don’t know shit. If they knew what it was like to die on a charnel road, they wouldn’t walk them. If you knew, you’d be kissing my feet. Believe me, Mandri, you don’t want to end up like one of those pilgrims. They walk charnel road just for the chance to rot on them, and let me tell you, that’s not all that happens to them.”
“I thought the point of walking a road was to get to where you’re going.”
“That’s not why Pilgrims walk the road. Go and ask a pilgrim why he doesn’t make the Bazul Road in the comfort of a caravan and he’ll tell you that if Bazul did not intend for him to suffer, then Bazul wouldn’t have allowed himself to be martyred out in the Sand—he would have been killed on some oated knoll near calm waters. Bazul’s shrine is set deep into the Sand because that’s the journey Bazul had in mind for his people. In a way, the road itself is the shrine.”
“Ah,” Mandri mumbled. It was a disinterested ‘ah’, and if Moto were a considerate person, sensitive to conversational cues, an utterance like that would have him clam up. 
“They think that walking the road is a test of faith against the power of the sun, and to skip that test is the same as having no faith at all. True Solitant pilgrims don’t trivialize the road by riding in a wagon or walking it at night. They walk the road in the heat of the day, and they die doing it.”
“Tragic.”
“Show some respect.”
“Sorry.”
“Don’t say sorry when you don’t mean it. If you don’t take your own words seriously, then I know you’re not taking mine seriously. You need to be serious, Mandri. I’m of half a mind to leave you here and let the sun finish you off. It’s not a good death. You ever seen a waterless man with a black tongue the size of a hermit slug? I don’t think you have. Imagine rubbing your eyes with no moisture in them. Imagine an ache that splits you from your head down to your toes. It feels like your stomach is peeling apart, like the marrow in your bones is boiling. The worst part is when your mouth dries out, it turns black and the tongue swells up to bursting.”
“Sounds horrible.”
“Haven’t got to the worst of it. There’s an old pile of pilgrim’s bones not far from here that I could show you. And when you see them you’ll see how they’re scattered about and are missing a few limbs. That’s because drag-bellys got to him. Takes a while for a pack of drag-bellys to eat a man full, and when you’re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you’ll still be alive when they do it.”
“I get it.”
“I do not think that you do,” Moto said. The man was relentless. “Drag bellies don’t wait for you to die, they just start chewing. A drag-belly’s venom stings worse than fire. It pulps the flesh. It’ll make your thighs look like brains and your brains look like spit. They got a hundred little teeth like needles.”
He then punched Mandri in the shoulder, dead-armed him. Mandri winced.
“Whatever pain you’re feeling now, it’ll be that times a hundred. And that’s when you learn how clever a drag-belly is, because they won’t bite you in the neck or somewhere serious. They know how to keep you alive as long as possible to keep the meat fresh, like they been trained by demons.”
“Look,” said Mandri, pleading. “I’m trying to tell you what I know, and what I know isn’t much. That’s the truth of it. I have no idea how I got to be out here, or wherever you found me.”
“No, you’re not getting out of this,” Moto said sharply. “You might be thinking you can just kill yourself before anything too painful happens, but you’re not thinking, thinking. I once left a boy like you half-buried in a mudpan near Fleet. Ask yourself why I would do a thing like that.”
Moto paused, as if to give Mandri a chance to answer, but the man couldn’t help himself and as soon as Mandri opened his mouth, Moto charged on ahead, the tenor of his voice growing firmer with every step, as if all of this was well rehearsed and he was just now getting into his favorite part.
“You want a hint? I’ll just tell you. It’s because if you can keep a man from bending at the waist then he can’t bash his own brains in. I once made the mistake of tying a man’s hands and ankles and nothing else, and you know what he did when he got bit by a red-backed drag-belly? He got down on his knees like a priest…then he bent back, face to the heavens like he’s rapt in prayer…that’s what I thought he was doing…maybe he was…and then—WHAM—he swung forward and smashed his head against a rock. Cracked his skull like a spider web.”
As Moto said all this, he imitated the action, headbutting the air.
“I don’t know how many times I can say this,” said Mandri, “But I honestly do not know how I got to be out there.”
“Oh, I don’t care about that anymore. We’ll put that off to the side for now. What’s more important is that you said you were fine with dying, so now my job is curing you of that illusion. See, I know what you are, Mandri, and I know what you need.”
“What do I need?”
“It’s not burgeons, that’s for damn sure.”
Moto then called out to the two of the nearest Ayramun walking ahead of them. They were only a little ways off, but still, Moto was shouting.
“Hey! Chopper!”
Both men stopped and turned around. The bald one on the right was Chopper. Chopper’s backpack was so big that he looked like a pack animal, his silhouette a bloated blob of burlap plopped atop two stick-skinny legs.
“Chop!?” He shouted.
Moto simply beckoned him with a wave, and chopper came running.
When he arrived, he looked at Mandri with thirsty eyes and asked, “Chop?”
Moto laughed and said, “No, no. Maybe. Follow us, you may get to chop something.”
Chopper nodded, and Moto led the three of them off the hump of the road and into the unsullied expanse of the Pitted Portion. 
Mandri mulled his options. Moto seemed serious about teaching him a lesson, and since Moto was a well-adjusted man, he was probably serious about doing harm. But there was nowhere to run—well, there was everywhere to run, but nowhere he could get to without Moto getting to him first. He was completely at Moto’s mercy.
He didn’t have to wonder how far they’d be walking because some few hundred yards away there was an outcrop of several round black rocks which looked unmistakably like a giant gore beetle the size of an ox. One large, round, smooth stone was the beetle’s body, and next to it was a much smaller boulder that looked like an upturned thorn—the beetle’s horned head.
Ringing around the base of these beetle looking rocks was not one lizard pit, but several. They were more like shallow pans than pits—drag-bellies aren’t very industrious creatures—and at the base each pan was a single, egg-shaped hole. There were no lizards in sight. Mandri supposed they were hiding in their dens because when Moto led Mandri to one of the larger pits, he did so with excitement. He crept up to it like the knee-deep crater might suddenly erupt.
Once at the pit’s edge, both Moto and Chopper unsettled their heavy packs, and Mandri unshouldered his meager one, and he let it drop without much care for what was in it.
“It’s time,” said Moto as he pulled a body’s length of rope from his pack. “In order for me to trust what you say, I first have to know that you care about what happens to your own skin. But you’re a burgeon biter, you don’t care about anything. What got you biting burgeons in the first place? Are you one of those limp dicks who can’t get a girl?”
“No.”
“It was a girl, wasn’t it? Hold out your arms.”
“It wasn’t a girl.”
Moto began to wrap a figure eight of rope around Mandri’s wrists. He said, “A boy your age gets upset and jumps into burgeons, it’s always over a girl.”
“Believe what you want.”
“A man’s got to have a reason to be sad. Chopper gets sad when you don’t let him chop.”
Chopper, who had been waiting patiently this whole time, perked up at the mention of his favorite word.
“Chop?”
“No chop,” said Moto.
Chopper’s shoulders sank.
“You see?” said Moto. “Sadness is cause and effect.”
“I’m not sad.”
“You’re right, you’re not sad, that’s not the right word—the right word is…is…” Moto looked up at the empty sky searching for inspiration. “I could never find the correct word for what you are, probably because it hasn’t been made yet. What you are has somehow escaped the notice of every poet who ever lived. But I know what you are because I used to be like you. That’s why you should count yourself lucky to have stumbled into me. I’m the one person in this whole wide world who knows how to cure you.”
Moto motioned to Chopper, but Chopper was too busy salivating at the sight of the too-long length of rope left after Moto had Mandri’s wrists together.
“Chop?” asked Chopper.
“No chop,” said Moto. “I want you to hold the boy down.”
Chopper, sullen, marched over and forced Mandri onto his ass. Mandri struggled a little, confused as to what, precisely, Chopper’s herks and jerks were trying to achieve. But damned, he was strong.
Moto pulled out another length of rope and said, “If you make this difficult, I’m going to have Chopper take your balls. You understand? Nod if you understand.”
Mandri suddenly felt a little frightened because Moto’s face was serious. He nodded. Moto then set about tying Mandri’s ankles together. That’s when Mandri noticed movement down in the lizard pit. A wide, shovel-like lizard snout hovered out of the dark den entrance. It licked the air with a yellow, split-leaf tongue, and before it could get in a second scenting, another snout appeared. The two lizards jostled for position, then the newcomer got feisty and started a hissing argument. It then lurched and bit the first lizard in the neck. A seething brawl erupted, and two lizards disappeared back into the den, scratching and clawing for the right to maul whatever was lurking outside. The brawl ended in a wild screeching hiss of pain, and the winner stuck its wide, froggish head out into the air. Its swiveling eyes worked over the three men, then settled on Mandri as though it knew he was the weakest.
Moto tied the knot around Mandri’s ankles tight, so tight that his ankle bones were bruising each other. Moto then stood up straight and observed his handiwork with approval. He said, “I need to prime you for what you’re about to experience, so—”, Moto paused, as if uncertain of what to say. “I’m going to ask you a question, and I want you to think very carefully about it. I want you to treat this question as if it were a newborn baby, like you’re holding a newborn for the first time, you understand?”
Mandri nodded. 
“Alright. Here it is—why did Solraheen create human beings?”
“What?”
“Why did Solraheen create us?”
“I’m not Solraheen, so how could I know?”
“Did I say to blurt out the first thing that came to mind? I said think about it.”
The drag-belly was now half-way out of its den. Its squat forearms were pushing it up as high as it could, so that its head could stretch up towards Mandri and smell his odor.
Mandri said, “It might help if you told me what this has to do with that lizard.”
Moto said, “What I’m doing is giving you a problem to solve—and that’s a hint to the answer of my question. Think about it—what is our purpose? Birds can fly, fish can swim, what can humans do better than any other creature?”
“I don’t know.”
Moto bent down, hands on knees, so that his face was close to Mandri’s. He said, face bright, “I can see the way you look at that lizard. You fear it. That drag-belly is a problem, isn’t it? It’s here in the present and you can’t ignore it. You’re thinking about what you’re going to do when I throw you in that pit. That’s what we do better than any other creature. You understand?”
“What are you talking about?”
Mandri truly had no idea. The lizard’s snout was getting close to the rim.
Moto stood back up, stood straight and proud, and declared, “The answer is problem solving! That’s what Solraheen made us do—we were made to solve problems. Birds were made to fly, fish were made to swim, and you and I were made to solve problems. Practical problems. That’s what we do. Now, you take a fish out of water, and what happens? It dies. You clip a bird’s wings and what happens? It becomes sad and helpless. A man has no problems, and what happens to him? That’s what’s wrong with you, Mandri. And to make it worse, you’ve filled your belly with burgeons, and when you do that, you lose the ability to identify problems in the first place. So, if you can’t even see them, then obviously, you’ve got no problems to solve! You’re a man without purpose, you understand?”
“Untie me,” Mandri demanded. He was done with whatever this was, because that lizard was getting close, and it was almost as big as he was. Its tongue was close to licking his ass. When Moto just stood there, Mandri tried to scoot away from the pit, but Moto’s foot stopped him.
“Here’s what I’m going to do,” said Moto. “I’m going to pick you up and put you into a problem. I’m going to toss you into this pit with that drag-belly. Your instincts will kick in, and you’re going to try to get out of the situation—you’re going to try to solve the problem. Because that’s what a man is supposed to do.”
“How am I going to fight off a lizard if my hands and legs are tied?”
“Don’t worry about that, Mandri. I mean, you should worry about it, but what I mean is, you’re going to be alright in the end. If you throw a bird off a cliff, what’s it going to do? It’s going to fly. You’re going to be flying before you know it.”
“If you tie up a bird’s wings, it’s not going to be able to fly.”
Moto shook this argument out of his head as if it were nonsense, then gave Mandri’s hip a kick, and Mandri rolled down into the pit. His sudden, tumbling arrival startled the drag-belly, and the big lizard spun around and scurried back into its hole.
Moto said, “You got about half a finger before that lizard finds the courage to come back out.”
Mandri stared at the black hole, eyes as wide as the moon.
“Alright,” said Moto. “Think about what you need to do. Assess your options.”
The drag-belly emerged once again from its den. Its fat head weaved side to side, its tongue warily tasting the air.
“You gotta hurry,” Moto said excitedly.
The lizard was a lumbering dolt. Its whole body swayed back and forth, and Mandri got a good view of the drag-belly’s belly drag. Soon it was upon him, its tongue flicked against his thigh, and its head kept swinging back and forth as if to savor the wonder of this free and easy meal.
But before the lizard could do anything, a loud bump sounded out of the lizard hole, and something inside that den grabbed the drag-belly’s long tail and yanked the whole beast, hissing and clawing, back into the dark. 
“Oh-Hoooo!” Moto thundered. “You ever seen a drag-belly queen, Mandri? She’s got to be twice the size of that bastard you just saw. This will be good!” 
Mandri stared into that drag-belly den, and yes he felt a little motivating fear, but he wasn’t about to give Moto the satisfaction of fighting back. He’d died once before, and by god, he’d do it again. He rolled himself over closer to the den.
“What in the white light are you doing?”
Mandri smirked and said, “I’m solving a problem.”
He thought those were some fitting final words. They could be interpreted a number of ways. Ambiguous but pointed.
He rolled over to face the dark den and meet his final fate. He peered into those shadows expecting to see the maw of a magnificent creature, but the head that moved in those depths looked like a man’s.
“What the—”
Suddenly, two scaly gray arms with taloned hands burst out of the hole and grabbed Mandri around his ankles. Mandri yelped in fright as he was pulled into the den.
“Oh, shit!” Moto exclaimed, and he hopped down into the pit.
Mandri was yanked down further and further until his hips plugged up the entrance. Then whatever frightening beast was pulling him down crawled up on top of his legs, and Mandri screamed as it set its long black talons to work in widening the den’s entrance.
Mandri wriggled and tried to free himself, but stopped when a searing pain exploded out of his thigh, just above his left knee. He could actually feel a vise of fangs scratch against his leg bone. 
“Ah, god! It bit me!”
Moto reached down, grabbed Mandri under the arms, and began to pull. In response, the creature caught Mandri’s ankles again—it was a man’s hands. This wasn’t a damned lizard.
A furious tug of war ensued until Chopper joined the struggle, and the two men heaved with all their frenzied might. Out came Mandri, but those greedy gray hands still gripped his ankles tight. With another strained heave Moto and Chopper pulled Mandri free and the beast’s snarling head burst forth into the light. Its visage was a sight undreamed of, the product of some unholy miscegenation between man and drag-belly lizard.
Its round skull was crested in bony ornaments, its lips were draped in tuberculate scales, and its tongue, white light, its long split tongue was flicking out a mouth filled with hungry, sharpened teeth. Its eyes were bulging out of its head—two round black-slitted orbs looking in different directions, and when it blinked, its wet, scaly lids squeezed those eyes back into their sockets, and when the blink was over they popped right out again.
“Chopper, quick!” Moto shouted as he pulled Mandri free of the pit. “Chop it!”
Chopper pulled from out of his robes a silver ax with a head that looked like a hand. He shouted a joyous, furious, “CHOP!”, and the gray man-thing shouted right back, sending a gargling hiss of swinging spit flying out of a wide pink throat that was studded all the way back with teeth. The two leaped at each other. Chopper was faster. His ax-head slammed right into the man-thing’s bulging right eye.
The beast squealed in pain and it tore itself out from under Chopper’s pinning blow. Chopper chased it back towards the den, and the beast disappeared, scrambling down while screeching.
Moto quickly untied the knot around Mandri’s wrists by pulling on a loose bit of rope, and he undid the knot around the ankles with similar ease. He used one length of rope to improvise a tourniquet high up on Mandri’s left thigh, just above where the creature had bitten it. He used a nearby stick as a windlass to twist it tight, and he twisted it so tight that the pressure was almost as painful as the bite.
“What was that!?” Mandri wailed.
Moto locked the tourniquet in place with a sturdy knot, then sat down to catch his breath. 
“What did it look like? It was a demon.”
“What!?”
“Don’t act all aggrieved with me. You didn’t even try to move out the way. You stiffened up. You rolled towards it.”
Mandri would have shrieked at the man, but the pain in his leg was several times more severe than his anger.
“Ah! God!”
“You got yourself bit by a demon, Mandri. It’s going to hurt. It’s going to do more than hurt.”
“It hurts!”
“That’s what I said.”
Moto stood up and brushed himself off. He looked around, glanced to the distant east, as if someone would be there to help. Then he sighed, set his hands on his hips, and eyed Mandri’s wound.
He said, “This is some real shit you’ve made.”
Mandri rolled on his side to try and flee the tortuous pain, but that somehow made it worse.
“Sol help me!”
“Yeah, well, all we got is Chopper.”
“Chop?” Chopper asked, staring at Mandri’s leg.
Moto snorted a laugh.
“I wish,” he said. “Oh, how I wish. Help me pick him up.”
Chopper jogged over, reached down, and the moment he touched Mandri’s demon-bitten thigh to lift him up, a searing pain shot through Mandri’s whole body and he fainted.</Text>

            <Text>A Solitant priest hears the word ‘white’ and he thinks of the pure white glow of the god Solraheen—a white so bright it bursts out of itself and splits softly into rays of red, green, and blue. A Hrkan man hears the word ‘white’ and he pictures the plain and stainless robes of Hrkan Lordship. An outland man hears ‘white’ and he thinks of sparkling salt pans, clouds, and sun-bleached bone. As it is with ‘white’, so it is with words, they mean different things to different people. It is some wonder then, that Solraheen would choose the medium of the word to create the world. He was there in the void, spoke one word, the world emerged, and people haven’t stopped arguing about the meaning of it all ever since.
‘Art’ is a particularly contentious word. Solitants say the word had a fixed meaning, back when artists were truly spiritual beings. But that was long ago, and in the ages since, the meaning of ‘art’ and ‘artist’ became confused, so much so that the heresy of ‘art’ as a means of personal expression pollutes the minds of many.
A Solitant sermon on ‘Art as Exegetical Instrument’ begins with the following questions:
What is art?
Who is an artist?
Who isn’t?
A painter, a sculptor, these are artists, yes, that’s reasonable to say, but a farmer? Can he be an artist too if he digs the dirt in a way that’s true to the Spark within himself? Give a man shovel, a field of dirt, time to think about it, friends to impress, and he’ll dig a pure expression of his innermost world—a hole as deep as he can manage. And this isn’t some nihilistic fling, it’s much simpler than that. It’s a hole. The Solitant would argue that if a man digging a pit into a field is an ‘artist’ then the word is as useless as an unmarked weight.
A sheep-shearer plying her shears is then an artist. 
A tax collector can be an artist if he’s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of greed. 
There is a need here, the Solitant argues, for a word with walls. The true artist, the divine instrument, must be held apart from the self-dwelling horde.
The Old Jandri word for ‘artist’ is lost to time, but there is a word in what’s left of that language fit for adoption—burshegee. Literally, burshegee means something like ‘fertile ground’, but in the Solitant tradition it means ‘true artist’. It doesn’t mean quite the same thing as ‘virtuoso’ because true artistry has almost nothing to do with what a person does, whether it be painting, pit-digging, sheep-shearing, or finessing balance sheets. Some true artists never make anything at all, yet true artists they remain because true artists, fertile ground, this is a state of mind. 
Such a mind is not necessarily noble, or righteous, or even intelligent. In fact, the mind of the true artist is often marked by comic excess—too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and so exaggerated is the sense of self that it becomes impossible to describe the person without resorting to sarcasm.
For example—Mandrameen was the humblest humble that ever humbled.
When asked what he did for a living, Mandrameen would say, “Nothing important. I paint things”, and then he’d add, “for whatever that is worth”. Then he’d strut around the grand Hrkan galleries and this charade of humility melted away because he could not hide his contempt for his contemporaries.
He’d stand in front of a painting and say, “This piece really moves me,” and then he’d make a show of walking away. All must bear witness to his mop of black hair as it flounced itself in time with his skinny, stiff-backed step.
Or he’d say, “I weep at every stroke,” and then he’d flash a knowing smile. 
He’d say these things directly to a fellow artist’s face if he could get to it. He didn’t think of it as mean-spirited because artists, like himself, were safe targets for playful derision. It wasn’t the person he was making fun of, it was their failed attempts to express themselves, and those are completely different things. He’d never go after the person, no. Artists are the best people. It takes the best kind of person to put themselves in front of others and push through the barbs. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to a life of sad obscurity.
Mandrameen would say to Vigram, “You haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.” Vigram’s crime? He’d said that he liked a painting that he shouldn’t have. Vigram’s wealth be damned, Mandri knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if, by some cosmic absurdity, he wasn’t correct in any of the literal, figurative, or spiritual senses, then ‘correctness’ did not belong to the domain of humanity. It was certainly out of Vigram’s reach. Old Vigram was not an artist, not even the hole-in-the-field kind. He’d made his fortune as a creditor. Meanwhile Mandrameen, when he was ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters.
And his were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brush strokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he’d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait the paint was amply applied via a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of thick umber on thin black he could define the chestnut skin, the high-arched cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, even the mood of the piece. One single stroke! He once painted a woman’s portrait using just twenty-four strokes—count them, twenty-four—and it was a true, vivid likeness. There were few extra nibbles here and there to make the eyes glisten and the cleavage heave, but those hardly counted. It didn’t stop Vigram from marveling at how young Mandrameen packed so much information into so few slips of paint.
“My dear Mandri,” Vigram would say, “These are the marks of genius!”
He’d say it often.
He paid Mandri for lessons.
This was something of a charity, for Mandri was twenty years old and despite his great talent in such a sacred discipline, he was inexplicably poor.
These lessons were given in Vigram’s countryside estate, a good way away from the must and crust of Meskalim. The days started with breakfast, where Vigram, a burly old man with a bald head and brown belly-beard that he kept oiled and trimmed, would push Mandri to explain why he hadn’t yet achieved success. Each week he’d put the question in a different way, but it was always about that same basic thing—why wasn’t Mandri swimming in money? Painters were richly rewarded throughout the Hrkan world. He should be swimming in money.
Mandri tried to explain that financial success, when it comes to art, has little to do with skill or quality. Novelty plays a role, but mostly it’s about preening tongues and critic’s pens. It’s about how many people knew the raw fact of your existence. Vigram always pushed back, and today Mandri settled the matter by declaring, in between mouthfuls of seared lizard lung, “I refuse to debase myself by doing what it takes to succeed.”
Vigram then regaled Mandri with the story of his own life, and he’d tell it in a way so as to suggest that accumulating wealth was the easiest thing in the world and that Mandri could do it too. Vigram had told the story so many times that Mandri could tell it right back.
First, inherit four ounces of silver. This may seem like an insurmountable obstacle for some, but if Vigram could do it, anyone could.
Next, loan those four ounces to two brothers who run a bakery. Make sure it's a bakery that supplies a Solitant temple with bread—that’s a surefire bet because temples are always the last thing the mob will burn down in lean times. The temple and the bakery brothers might accuse you of committing usury against Solraheen Himself, because you are, but if you get together with a priest and pray about it around a jug of beer and then flash him a slip of silver, the bleary shine will blind him.
After that, lend smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who need emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. Split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim’s bond market. There’s not much money in Meskalim itself, but it has a busy port and that means access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.
From there, it’s a simple matter of sprouting six more eyes, four more limbs, and now that you’ve become a human spider you’ll be able to spin a web of silver that stretches into every corner of the holy continent. The fools will walk right into the net of debt. The wiggling sticks them snug. You pick out the salvageable ones for your own use, and now you’ve got a little brood of spiders pouring over lists of sums credited and debts owed, and as long as you maintain a layer of abstraction between these creatures and your muscle, it’s all self-sustaining.
And that’s it. Now you have a comfortable life and idle hours to spend however you please.
“No debasement necessary,” Vigram added.
Mandri chowed down on the cold, crumbled chunks of what he supposed was black-sauced beef spleen. Most of Vigram’s breakfast foods were unfamiliar, as Vigram could afford to eat a different delicacy for every meal, every day of the week. He also had a chronic toothache, so he preferred foods that had to be scooped with sand clam shells and sauces that would stick to the roof of the mouth. This toothache also forced Vigram to talk out the side of his mouth in a wincing drawl.
“We’ve forgotten to pray,” he said.
Mandri set a clam shell down, bowed his head, and prepared himself to endure a Sparkless prayer that was more habitual than ritual. Vigram called, and Mandri responded.
“Bless this food,”
	“So that it can be,”
“Consumed by the body,”
	“So that it can,”
“Feed the Spark,”
	“So that it can,”
“Move the flesh,”
	“So that it can be,”
“Consumed by the body.”
Vigram wiped the grease off his fingers. “Now, Mandri,” he said. “You know all about art. And that’s why I respect you so much. But I know all about money, and at a certain point you have to join them up, because the world doesn’t work how it should. The world works how it works. You have to make a living.”
Mandri wolfed down a peach-jellied egg, then meekly agreed. He would have told Vigram what he really thought, but he really, really, needed Vigram’s money.
Vigram clapped his meaty hands and a nameless slave came in and took their plates. Then the two of them headed out to Vigram’s vine-trellised, brown-brick patio, where Vigram set himself to work in setting up a canvas and an easel which he claimed to have built himself—slaves cut and planed the lumber, brewed the glue, hammered the metal fittings, but mighty Vigram did the rest.
Mandri said, “Are you sure you want to do this here?”
“Why not?” asked Vigram. “Is there something wrong?”
“No. There’s nothing wrong, exactly. It’s that this light is going to make things so much more difficult.”
The patio’s roof was not yet thick enough with vines, and that meant a richly dappled light would fall upon the sitter.
Vigram shook his head, which sent his great brown beard wiggling as if it were alive. “My dear Mandri,” he said, letting his drawl roll heavy. “The patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.”
“Well, you can worry about ‘magical vestures’ when you’re good enough to make a face look like a face.”
“No,” said Vigram. “I won’t have it any other way. A magical vesture for a magical subject.”
As if bidden from the heavens by Vigram’s words, his daughter, Lora, joined them on the patio. She was Vigram’s favorite subject, Mandri’s age, the only one of Vigram’s five children willing to sit for him. 
“Isn’t she a subject fit for holy oils?” Vigram asked.
“Undoubtedly,” said Mandri as his eyes flicked to Lora without intention, though Vigram interpreted it, as he always did, as the most rabid of intentions. The old man’s eyes squeezed out a suggestive smile, as if to give Mandri his patriarchal blessing.
Mandri pretended he didn’t notice.
Lora was good natured, comely, with clear brown skin and sun-kissed cheeks. She was also a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen lowing in the adjacent field. Many a young man would leap at the chance to be with such a fertility goddess, unfortunately Mandri didn’t want to have children.
“Help her up,” Vigram commanded. “I’ll ready the canvas and paint.”
Mandri did as he was told and helped Lora up onto a high-legged stool. Lora let her fingers linger on his arm. Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his muse.
Again, Mandri did as he was told and took up his post behind the old man.
Vigram snatched up a stick of soft charcoal and put down his first exploratory marks. This was always always the most difficult phase. Every work of art has to be built on a firm foundation. Get it wrong and everything that comes after will be wrong as well. Unfortunately for Vigram, he had that all-too-common beginner’s habit of refusing to use his god-damned brain. He started drawing wherever his hand randomly landed and what happened next was up to Solraheen. The end result was that Lora’s head was, somehow, too small. It was also too left-of-center. There’d be an awkward expanse behind her flower-studded curls.
“Hold on,” said Mandri. “You’re moving too fast. Don’t think of this as a portrait—not yet. All we have right now is an oval, a rectangular canvas, and where that oval sits on the canvas. All you’re doing is putting an oval on the canvas.”
“Right.”
“So think about where’s the best place to put that oval. Make use of the whole canvas.”
“Yes, yes you’re right.”
Vigram rubbed the marks away with his palm.
He stepped back.
He studied Lora.
He stepped again to the canvas.
Then he scratched a black oval right back where it had been.
“Is that better?” he asked with all the awareness of a potted plant.
“It needs to be a little bigger, I think.”
Vigram drew the oval again, but only slightly larger. Mandri encouraged the old man to continue, and from then on, almost every mark Vigram made was accompanied by a look back to Mandri for reassurance. 
“Don’t look at me, look at her.”
“I need to know if it is right or if it is wrong.”
“Assume that it’s always wrong, and then try to figure out why it’s wrong, and then fix it.”
There was a glimmer of understanding in Vigram’s eye, but as soon as it came it faded. He twirled his beard between his fat fingers, then asked, “If the mark I make is always wrong, then how could I ever move past it? I’ll be redrawing the same line over and over again.”
“You move on when you want to move on.”
“Then I want to move on. I’m here to paint, not draw.”
“Well, hold on. Finish…finish the basic shapes, at least.”
“Alright.”
Vigram ‘finished’ the ‘basic shapes’. He looked to Mandri for final approval.
“It’s your paint,” Mandri said with a shrug. “But you need to understand the importance of the drawing.”
“I do understand. You talk about it all the time.” Vigram tossed his charcoal over his shoulder and squealed with delight as he picked up his favorite brush.
Mandri watched on in confusion as Vigram threw down the first splotches of color in a flurry. The man was building an affront to the senses, and Mandri was getting paid to witness it. And he couldn’t deny a glance or two in Lora’s direction, for she was the sitter. Whenever his eyes wandered over to her, her smile would perk up. 
“Mandri, stop flirting with my daughter.”
Vigram hid himself behind the canvas and gave Mandri a knowing nod and encouraging smile.
“I’m not flirting,” said Mandri. “I’m checking proportions.”
“And how are her proportions?” Vigram’s eyebrows jumped suggestively. Lora, for her part, squirmed in her seat, blushing in feigned embarrassment, loving the attention.
Mandri said, “Vigram, let’s focus on your painting.”
“What’s wrong with it?”
Mandri paused to give Vigram time to refocus his energy into the task at hand. Mandri knew what was wrong with the piece—he could write a treatise on it. He also knew that Vigram wouldn’t be able to handle an unvarnished critique. If the man got upset, then there’d be no more money, and Mandri really, really needed the money. Mandri was forced to compromise with himself and exercise restraint. He had to do what everyone else does—start off with a disarming compliment. Pick out a positive to open the student up to critique. The problem, at present, was that there was literally nothing good there on canvas.
“It’s good,” said Mandri.
He leaned back, sank into his hip and made every honest effort to study the mishmash that Vigram was putting down. Unfortunately, Vigram had that other beginner’s habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes—while that can be done, it's a very dangerous thing to do. Oils dry too slowly to mess around. 
“Vigram…”
“I know, I know.”
“I’m gonna say it anyway. You need to get the color correct on the palette before it touches the canvas. That’s what the palette is there for.” 
Vigram nodded, then began his work again in earnest, and the morning dragged on.
Eventually Vigram’s assault reached his daughter’s chin and he mixed a bluish shade of bronze. Unless there was some extraordinary circumstance of light and shadow—which there wasn’t—it was a color meant for the chin of a Jandri man who keeps a close shave. Vigram slapped it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes darted between his daughter and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips curled into a frown and he muttered, “That’s not quite right.” He gave Mandri a sheepish grin, then he stabbed his brush into a slug of white, and he rubbed it into that manly chin.
“That’s not quite right either.” 
This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.
“It’s not bad,” he said.
The charcoal guidelines looked like they were bleeding pus.
One of those leafy shadows had drifted over Lora’s left eye, and Vigram had an amusing go at it—it looked like a bandit’s eye-patch. 
“It’s good,” said Mandri. “No really, I mean it. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s… it’s on the path.”
“It does not do justice to such a fine daughter,” said Vigram.
Mandri tapped his bottom lip as Vigram stepped aside to let him fully into the work.
Mandri said, “Do you remember what I said last week?”
“You said that I need to study hands.”
“And have you done that?”
“Nope!”
Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. He had avoided the hands altogether. Under Mandri’s supervision, Vigram attempted to paint them. It was like watching a child stir food around on their plate, and when Vigram pulled his brush away, there were no hands, there were two bundles of sticks sticking.
Mandri gave a meager smile to encourage the man. “The only things that matter are the face and the hands,” he said. He was struggling to stay useful. “You could give Lora a hundred ribs and a single breast and people will forgive you for it, so long as you’ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, anatomically correct hands.”
“I’ll do better with the hands.”
Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his frustrated brow. This whole ordeal was a waste of time. If he didn’t need that money so damned bad, he’d have quit after the first session.
His little reverie was interrupted when Lora jumped from the stool, crying out, “Mandri’s ox is eating the apples!”
She pointed an accusing finger to the hill beyond the trellis. All eyes peered through the vines, where some twenty yards away stood Mandri’s one true possession—a skinny yellow ox named Gil. Gil was craning his head up high to reach a sweet red apple. His long pink tongue was stuck out and twirling, but all it was doing was batting the ripened fruit around in circles.
Vigram turned to Mandri, “Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?”
“Gil has a right to go where he wants,” Mandri said firmly.
“Well he’s not got a right to my apples! If that ox eats anything that’s not already on the ground, I’ll have my man butcher it up. Now get the beast tied up.”
“Where are you going?”
“I’m going to pick out wine for brunch. Lora, my sweet, help the boy clean up. I’ll call you both when refreshment is ready.”
Old Vigram set his brush down, wiped his charcoal-stained fingers on an untouched corner of the canvas, and then plodded off, leaving Mandri trapped on the patio with Lora.
Lora slid off her stool and sauntered over to Mandri, where her intrepid hand brushed the back of his arm. “I can help you,” she said. “I know how to catch animals.”
“Gil is not an animal,” said Mandri. “His Spark’s as bright as yours or mine.”
“He’s an ox, Mandri.”
“I’m serious. Watch…” Mandri turned to Gil, and out of her reach. “Gil!” he shouted. “Gil, C’mere!”
Gil’s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. His protuberant eyes stared back through the vines, a dumb, bovine ogle. Slobber dripped unheeded from his lower lip. 
“Gil!”
Gil blinked, then got distracted by the long grass brushing his belly. He bit off a mouthful and began to chew.
“Gil! Hup!”
This startled Gil into motion, sending him trotting towards the patio. The flap of his heavy dewlap rolled his short-hair hide back and forth over his sagging, aged spine.
“Poor old creature,” Lora muttered.
“Ah, he’s fine,” Mandri said.
Gill clopped onto the patio as if it were his living room.
Lora hid herself behind Mandri in mock fright. It was enough of an excuse for her to squeeze Mandri’s scrawny shoulders and press herself against him.
“You don’t need to be scared of Gil,” said Mandri. “He’s the nicest old ox you’ll ever meet. He likes a good scratch right between the eyes. See?” He stepped aside, out of Lora’s grasp, and stepped to greet Gil. 
Lora ventured hesitantly towards Gil, and Gil let her scratch him into a cooing moo.
She said, “He’s a sweet thing, isn’t he?”
“He is. But not as sweet as Vigram’s painting.”
Lora eyed her father’s painting and stifled a smile, but the depiction of her was so ridiculous that her smile grew bigger and bigger, until she finally broke out in laughter.
“He’s turned me into a demon,” she said. “It’s the hands, they look like claws.”
“I try to tell him…hands require practice.”
Lora sidled up to Mandri, grabbed his hand and said, with all the lust and must of a woman in heat, “Artists need strong and dexterous hands, don’t they?” 
“Uh…No…well, yes, but, uh… I don’t have any, uh, dexterity. I actually haven’t painted anything in years.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Lora. “We’ve seen you paint.”
“Demonstrations, sure, but those don’t really count.” 
“Then what have you been doing up on that little farm of yours?”
“Farming.”
Lora rolled her eyes. “Look at you,” she said. “You’ve never farmed a day in your life.”
“I’m not lying.”
Lora stepped closer and purred, “Then why don’t you paint anymore?”
“Uh…it would be too hard to explain.” Mandri tore himself away from Lora yet again and tried to busy himself with Vigram’s mess. There was enough untouched pigment left on the palette for four more portraits. He moved to scrape a slap of yellow back into its little clay jar.
“Try to explain it,” said Lora.
“Well, painting is, uh...”
Mandri tried to think of a palatable excuse, then he realized it was sitting right in his hands. “It’s too expensive. I mean, look at all this pigment. The canvas. At this point in my life it’d take me weeks to afford all this. Your father makes this in half a day.”
“You could make that much too if you came and worked for him.”
“I’m not good with money.”
“All you’d be doing is signing a scrap of paper every now and again.”
Lora picked up a dirty brush and twirled its horse-hair head through the muddy colors of the palette.
She said, “You know, he doesn’t actually care about learning to paint. The only reason he pays for these lessons is because you would starve if he didn’t. He likes you. I like you.” She batted her eyes and tried to catch him staring.
“Is that how he feels about it?” Mandri asked. “Well I don’t need charity.”
Lora sighed. “Mandri, I’ve seen your farm. My dad’s seen your farm. Everybody’s seen your farm. It’s not a farm.”
“It’s a farm to me. And it’s a farm to Gil. Isn’t that right, Gil?”
He turned to the animal, but Gil wasn’t even on the patio. He’d snuck his way back up the hill to lick at that damned apple.
Lora rolled the handle of the paintbrush in between her fingers. She said, “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
“What?”
“They say that you’re a eunuch.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
“An old woman came looking for you. She said you were a eunuch, too.”
“A woman came here just to tell you I’m a eunuch?”
“She called you a gaburshegee. She said that means eunuch, and she was looking for you.”
“When?”
“Yesterday.”
“Well she couldn’t have been looking for me, because I’m not a eunuch.”
“Prove it.”
Mandri’s jaw dropped. 
“What?”
Lora crossed her arms and gave Mandri a sly, expectant look. “I’m a woman, Mandri. What’s your problem?”
“I’m not going to pull my uglies out just to prove they’re there.”
Mandri believed this would be enough to put her off, but Lora was a girl trained in the art of bashful men. She saw right through him and made her move, grabbed his arm and pulled him close. She caught his eyes and forced him to confront her lilac scent, her pounding heat, her smooth skin, her honeyed, aching lips.
“Lora…” 
Mandri knew he had to be very careful here.
“You’re a beautiful girl, but—”
“But what? You go in for men?”
“No!—no.”
“I could be good for you,” she said.
“And what do you get out of it?”
She squeezed herself against him and her warmth was overwhelming.
“You could be good for me,” she said. 
“You would not say that if you really knew me.”
“What’s there to know? You’re just a boy.”
Mandri’s eyes widened at the sight of her inviting smile, and the soft shadows of the vines overhead just so happened to frame her sparkling brown eyes with the most magnificent golden light. A magical vesture indeed. 
He nearly broke. He probably would have too if Gil hadn’t reached his apple and let out a triumphant bellow. 
“MMMMRRRRUUUUUooooooooooOOOOOOOoooo!”
Gil’s roar was so loud and sickly that it startled Mandri and Lora out of their awkward embrace.
Mandri backed up against the vines.
“Lora, this is not what I’m here for.”
“It’s what I’m here for,” said Lora.
Mandri looked for a means of escape and his eyes stumbled over one of the house’s misty window panes, behind which Vigram’s bearded face was smiling so wide it seemed he was about to stamp a return on interest.
“Okay. I’m leaving.”
Mandri practically leaped off the patio.
Lora shouted after him, “What is wrong with you?”
Mandri did not answer. There was no point in answering. This was not what he was here for. He ran, then jogged, then walked, then stopped when he realized that he was forgetting something.
“Gil!”
But Gil was already trotting down the gentle hill to follow. Mandri waited up, and together they headed for the estate’s swing gate.
Vigram was on their heels, marching fast with his robe hiked up and his long beard tucked under his arm.
“What happened!?” he shouted.
“Nothing,” said Mandri. “I’m leaving.”
“You’re leaving?”
“Look, Vigram, I don’t want to be a bother, but could I get the money?”
Vigram frowned. He reached into his robe and pulled out a small brown sack of coin. He held it in the air as if to lure Mandri back towards the house.
He said, “Lora thinks you’re using this money to buy burgeons from Geem.”
“Burgeons?” asked Mandri.
“You deny it?”
“What would Lora know?”
“Do you deny it?”
“Of course I deny it.”
Vigram eyed Mandri with suspicion, then he shook the bag of coin and said, “I want you to promise me that you’re not going to use this money to buy burgeons.”
“I promise.”
Vigram looked down his nose at Mandri and scratched his beard. He said, “I’m going to give you this money because I owe it. If I find out you’re using this for burgeons, then our arrangement here is finished. You won’t be coming back. And for Sol’s sake, buy some apples for this creature of yours.”
“I will.”
Vigram put the bag in Mandri’s palm, and Mandri tucked it into his robe.
“You’ve got the gift of the brush, Mandri. Solraheen’s given you a gift. It’s a sacred gift.”
“I know. I’ll see you later.”
Mandri and Gil walked out the gate. 
“I’m serious!” Vigram called out. “You’ve been given a gift!”
Mandri waved back.
It wasn’t a gift, not a special one, at least. He could paint a portrait in twenty-four strokes, but few would be impressed if they watched him do it. He would spend hours and hours making those single strokes. He’d put one down, and if it wasn’t exactly right, he’d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and he’d repeat this for as long as it took. Days. A week. Longer. Had to wait for the paint to dry. People only ever saw the finished product, those twenty-four strokes, and upon seeing it they assumed that Mandri’s brush went slip-slap-boom and there’s a true likeness. That story couldn’t be further from the truth. Mandri’s real talent was his tolerance of tedium, and that’s a talent a person can lose—Mandri was living proof. 
When he and Gil got to the top of the big hill that overlooked Vigram’s estate, he took one last look back. Vigram was still standing in his drive. The old man waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, “No burgeons!”
“Yeah, yeah,” Mandri muttered under his breath.
“They’ll douse your Spark!”
Mandri waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem’s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. They were Down-Valley burgeons, decent stuff but the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle so they’d split too quickly and the insides would dry out before Mandri could get to them. But that was all Geem had so he bought them. 
Mandri and Gil continued along the road, stomping their way through the muddy wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, humming and mooing nursery rhymes until they made it back Mandri’s farm. There he could finally relax and lose all sense of himself in the deep and blessed bliss brought on by beer spiked through with burgeons.</Text>

            <Text>Near Tob’s belly was a leather pack and he reached down into it and pulled out a bright brown pouch the size of his fist. He loosened the string that kept it closed and revealed to Mandri an assortment of rocks and pebbles inside. “Take one of my rocks.”
“Don’t,” said Forty.
“These are lucky rocks,” said Tob, ignoring her. “Count yourself blessed. They be small measures of luck, but they do in a pinch—not that a lucky prick like you needs them.”
“How do you know they’re lucky rocks?” Mandri asked as he looked over the stones, pretending to be impressed. 
“They’ve been tested,” Tob said. “You pick a rock up, try to do somethin’ with it, then see what happens. If it works, good chance is the thing is lucky. If it works ten times over, then its been tested.”
“I see.”
“I keep the unlucky rocks, too,” Tob continued. “They’re not as good as a curse pot, but if someone gets to pesterin’ you, slip one of these bad boys into their pocket.” Tob then took another pouch from out of his things, and opened it to reveal another bunch of rocks. Each of these had a white ‘X’ scratched into them. Tob picked one of them up and smiled at Forty while he thumbed its grooves.
“Little stones of retribution. Ever find one of these babies in your shoe, Forty?”
Forty shrugged.</Text>

            <Title>White Tails</Title>
            <Text>The next morning they came across a herd of white-tails one-thousand strong. More commonly known as poop-tails, or piss-tails. Mandri asked Obo why they shat on their tails, because Obo had an answer for everything. Obo said that when it gets too hot—and it always gets too hot—white-tail lizards cup their webbed hind feet and then evacuate their cloacal contents onto them, allowing them to rub their tails in it, and they do this so that when they raise their tails into the air and open them up like sails, the liquid from their piss-shit gets sucked up by the sun, and in so doing, it draws the heat from the body.
Seb overheard this explanation and said, “Like garglin’ piss to wet the throat.”
Mandri didn’t even cringe at the thought. When the heat dries out the throat it gets scratchy. This time spent in the wilderness had acquainted him well with his body’s functions, because the body is all there was. By now, nothing about it was disgusting.
Mandri worried that if he found Seb’s behavior to be tolerable, he himself must look outlandish. Yes, he was turning into a regular poke in sight and mind. Solraheen knows he slathered on enough kell oil to look the part.</Text>

	- unless it’s Ayram who gives the reveal.
	- while he’s dying, he tells the story.
	- Mandri kills Elrahet in secret while high. Everyone is just like, she’s off to do witchy things.
	- Greskal will help us.
Other problem - two sacrifices one after another.

	- Purl fails.
	- Elrahet freaks. Gonna kill her. Mandri kills Elrahet.
	- Ayram freaks/she must have seen something

	- Mandri gives it to Obo.
	Obo kills all.
	We did it!
	No, we are witchless. Pell is still alive.
	- “Pell lives in Shis?”

            <Title>Hold Back Seb</Title>
            <Text>Mandri walked that day in silence.
What he’d seen was difficult to comprehend.
Obo was also confused, but he was also eager to hash it out.
Obo started off with an apology, because he didn’t want Mandri to think that he’d lied—he had said before that it was impossible for Mandri to be a Minder, yet Mandri had almost succeeded in calling for the Mazidfire. It was clearly possible.
If Obo had legs, he would have tripped over himself trying to explain why he couldn’t explain Mandri’s near success. But Mandri knew the causes at play—he had literally seen them, shining white threads pulling up his arm at Elrahet’s suggestion.
The truth was that he hadn’t done anything.
He explained to Obo about the God’s Eye burgeons, about what he saw, about how it was all Elrahet, that she’d controlled him, and she’d controlled him easily.
Hearing this, Obo’s excitement at Mandri’s near success disappeared.
“I think I know why I was chosen,” Mandri said. “I’m chosen precisely because I’m so weak. I’m too easy to manipulate.”
He walked on, carrying Obo, into the gloom of night. He heard Ayram tell Seb to not venture so far ahead. He said that from now on, “We stick together.” Seb became prickly after that. Call her name and she’d respond with a despondent sneer.</Text>

            <Title>Salavan Soreen</Title>
            <Text>The garden holds a sacred place in Solitant cosmology, and so every person who wants to appear distinguished has one. Since Mandri grew up amongst these well-adjusted persons, he’d seen his fair share of gardens. He’d walked under the royal palms of Skinee, and he’d nearly drowned in the terraced falls of Luzee. He’d seen every garden that people brag about seeing, but none of these sights compared to Salavan’s garden, for everyone else’s garden was a thirsty greenscape, accented here and there by vibrant splashes of flower and fruit and split in half by the glow of the atmosphere reflecting off the surface of some placid stream or artificial lake. Salavan’s garden was a garden of stone. Mandri had never heard of a garden composed entirely of curated stone. When he stepped through Salavan’s gate and onto a plane of bone-white pebbles, he gasped.
It was a true garden. It obeyed all the rules a young artist learns when scribbling out compositions for clients. First and foremost is to establish a hierarchy of form—if there are stones they’ve got to come in different sizes—big, medium, and small—and they’re to be arranged in such a way so as to draw the eye, or in this case, a person, through a maze of perception and towards what is important. It was about contrast. Most rules of thumb in art have to do with manipulating contrast. Sharp against soft. Dark against light. Many against few. Big against little. Here, a rippling sea of smooth white pebbles bounced up against jagged knots of gray granite, granite which grew in size towards the center of this snow-white field of stone. In the very center stood a towering spike of Fabled Black.
Mandri couldn’t believe his eyes. Outside of the Jeket’s cavern temples, he’d only seen tiny fragments of Fabled Black in satin lined boxes, resting on pillows, shielded by glass. Here was a sharp obelisk of it, and it was as tall and as wide as any of the four-story sandstone columns that held up the roof of the great mansion behind.
Fabled Black. The skewering stone. A shard of the firmament. The quintessence of night. If it were a tree, and the pebbles, grass, and the granite were bushes, it all would have been too deliberate—a stilted garden, devoid of the dynamism and spontaneity one sees in Nature. But this was a god-killing stone, and so the stasis, the absence of life, that was the point.
Mandri walked right up to this black obelisk. He saw his own reflection in its surface sheen split by streaks of rain. He looked worse than he’d ever been—eyes red and witless, face gaunt and sallow, lips cracked, and his sodden hair clung too tight to his meatless skull. He looked like death. Perhaps everyone who looked into the depths of Fabled Black looked like death.
He lamented the absence of his burgeon beer.
A man’s voice rose out of the ether behind him.
“The stone makes the most wondrous pigment.”
Mandri spun around, and standing five feet behind him was a massive man who stood two heads taller than himself, and he had a barrel of a chest was easily thrice the size of Mandri’s own. The man’s great bulk was draped in a white silk robe, and his face was Jandrian through and through—high cheeks, a strong brow, and narrow eyes. The only outlier was his hair, for he had no beard, and instead of the usual scruff of Jandri black, it was as white as his robe, or the rocks underneath his feet.
He didn’t look like a demon, though Mandri couldn’t be sure, for he’d long lost his burgeon beer, and without its aid his burgeonsight was dimming. Nothing was twisting the man’s genteel airs. He looked so prim and proper because he kept his great bulk out of the rain through the use of a tiny, black-lacquered umbrella.
This large man looked past Mandri towards the obelisk and said, “It makes a black that rivals the crow.”
Mandri dared to sneak a look behind at the spire of Fabled Black. He wanted to ask how this man had come into possession of such a thing, and why he dared to keep it outdoors. A spire of Fabled Black like this must be worth a mountain.
“I am Salavan,” the man said. “And you are the great Mandrameen. I love your work. I was hoping that, some day, you would find your way to my door, and here you are.”
Mandri spread his arms out wide to present himself, but he did not speak, as he was afraid his voice would squeak.
Salavan walked up to the stone and set his meaty hand upon the spike of Fabled Black, caressing it as if it were a prized horse.
“It is incredible isn’t it?” he said. “Yet it is only a small sliver of the comet which killed Solraheen and Schisol.”
Curiosity got the best of Mandri, and he asked, “How did you get it?”
“Bribery,” Salavan said proudly. “Provisions for the smuggling alone cost me thirty-five silver strings.”
“I see.”
Salavan grimaced at the air of judgment in Mandri’s voice. He said, “I didn’t steal it, boy, I paid for it. So what if that money went to poorer people than it was supposed to. In truth, my acquiring of this stone was an act of charity—charity for the people who moved it, and charity for the thing itself. A stone such as this belongs in a place of prominence, not shuttered away in some dirty Jeketian cave. Here it is out in the air, where it belongs. You can touch it if you like.”
“No thanks.”
“You’re right, there’s no need.” Salavan pulled his hand away from the rock. “Merely being in its presence is enough.”
Fabled Black was notorious for its aura of gloom. A small shard of it could make the happiest child feel chill and rotten. Here in such quantity, that feeling crept down to the bone.
Salavan followed Mandri’s gaze and said, “Isn’t it strange that everything that falls from the sky should radiate sadness? Rain makes me sad, and so does this stone. Either the heavens are a void of a despair and these elemental things are infused with it, or this earth is a supremely disappointing place, and so things cast down upon it radiate a longing to be somewhere else.” He turned to Mandri and said, “Would you say that’s what you feel right now? A longing to be somewhere else?”
“You could say that.”
“Don’t be so glib. Consider—wouldn’t the rain prefer to dance in the clouds? Wouldn’t this stone rather gird the stars than be stuck here in the ground? I think so. You see, the Black is alive. In a very real sense, it is alive, and I can’t wait to show you what it can do. Would you like to see?”
Salavan spared Mandri a beneficent smile. His teeth were as white as Pell’s. They did not sparkle, for some strange force—perhaps the stone, or the long march up the hill, or Salavan himself—was pushing the burgeons out of Mandri’s sight and his mind back into sobriety. 
Mandri said, “I don’t have a choice, do I?”
“What gave you that idea?”
“Well, I take it you’re familiar with the old witch, Pell?”
“Of course.”
“Pell said that if I didn’t come and see you, she would kill me.”
“She said exactly that?”
“Yes.”
“And here you are, seeing me.”
“Yes.”
“Then you have fulfilled that obligation.”
Mandri was stunned by the cold sense of it. But it was too simple, too legalistic. A demon-witch wasn’t the kind of creature to care about the strict definitions of words. It wasn’t enough to simply see the man, there was something more he was supposed to do here. He imagined Pell ripping out his innards as he screamed, “But I did what you said, I saw him!” 
 “Mandrameen—can I call you Mandri? Mandri, I won’t have this tension in my house. You are safe here, and you are free to leave at any time. Or, if you are at all curious about what may lay in store for you, then say it, and we shall find it out together.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
Salavan chuckled and his great bulk chuckled along with him. He said, “Yes, I am aware. Would you like to come inside?”
Mandri nodded, but Salavan scowled back. “Assert yourself,” he said brusquely. “I won’t have any of this meekness in my house. Stand up straight if you can. Sol’s light. You look like you were born yesterday.”
“Whatever.”
Salavan scrunched up his big round face and said, “That’s not much better, but it will have to do. Come.”
 Salavan skirted around Mandri and past the spike of Fabled Black. The way he moved, it was dainty and deliberate, completely at odds with his massive size. He was careful to keep the hem of his robe out of any puddles, and his umbrella was so small that he couldn’t walk at stride without the rain splashing his legs—so he shuffled across his stone yard, looking to Mandri like a great white pig tiptoeing its way through a briar patch. 
Mandri followed, and once he was under the roof of the mansion’s grand portico, Salavan gave him a patronizing look of concern.
“You’re soaked,” Salavan said, “A towel and a change of clothes.”
Salavan clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed from the small servant’s door, carrying a towel and a white linen tunic. Mandri was dried and fitted with the knee-length tunic, then he and Salavan proceeded inside.
“Do you like my home?” Salavan said. “It cost me fifty silver strings to import the lumber to burn the lime for the plaster, and that was just for the outer wall. This interior, the plaster, the paints, that cost…well, I don’t want to go on and on about expenses.”
Salavan gave a smug and self-aware smile.
Was the house extravagant? Yes.
Was it impressive? Mandri didn’t think so.
Unlike the garden outside, the place met expectations. Mandri could have been standing inside any number of the miniature palaces that scabbed the Hrkan world. Tall arched ceilings. Wide halls. Skinny walls. Sparsely decorated. Everything painted white. No lamps, or torches, for fear that the soot might stain that whiteness. Only natural light, Solraheen’s light, was allowed in. Today that natural light was a rainy gray that didn’t do much to illuminate the vast interior. It was dark, and stark, and empty—again, not unusual, in fact it was desired, for the dull whiteness of everything was a religious expression of sorts. White is the most sacred color—white for the all-white spark. True white does not exist in the material world, ever since the glow of Solraheen’s body was snuffed out. Hrkan tradition claims that it is a pious thing to strive for pure whiteness. The ostentation of color was to be abhorred, unless it was bounded by a frame, in which case it was encouraged. Art, painting, these were sacred things, but they must be contained for it was said that Solraheen would refuse to dwell in a place that presumed to escape the bounds of being a mere created thing. 
It might seem that the quest for piety would be at odds with extravagant games the rich play to prove their wealth, and thus, their superiority, but instead of humbling them, the cleanliness, the whiteness, the starkness, these became the rules of their competition. If one is only allowed to have nothing, then the question becomes, how much nothing could one man accumulate? The height of the ceiling becomes a measure of how much emptiness he could afford to horde. Judge the floor—the richer man’s floor bears nothing, not even dirt, such that a truly rich man could afford to employ a person or persons to always be wiping away the filth tramped in from the street. Salavan’s floor was as white as the sway-away ceiling, and as he and Mandri walked along barefoot, a girl was crawling behind on her hands and knees with a bowl of water and a brush, scrubbing away.
Salavan said, “How do you find my home?”
“Very clean,” said Mandri, careful to disguise his bitterness.
“Yes. Perhaps you will find my gallery stimulating. I’ve some pieces here that you won’t see anywhere else—but that goes without saying.”
“Any of those stolen?”
The accusation put a hitch in Salavan’s step, and he seemed a little too eager to show amusement.
“None of them are stolen. Aside from that shard of Fabled Black, I’ve acquired everything I own through perfectly legal means. I even have something of yours here. One of your best works, I think.”
“Spare me.”
“Don’t be modest, Mandri. I won’t have falseness.”
Salavan clapped his hands and another servant came forth from some narrow orifice, carrying a shallow bowl lined with finger-length wraps of freeweed.
Salavan said, “If paintings aren’t your pleasure, how about a wrap?”
Mandri declined, and Salavan seemed genuinely surprised. “You are remarkably lucid,” he said. “You do have that hopeless look about you, but I supposed that was, you know, the general malaise of the indigent.”
Salavan selected a wrap for himself, put it in a pocket inside his robe, and waved the servant away. 
He said, “We shall skip the freeweed, and perhaps we’ll skip the gallery tour for another time, you came here for a purpose, after all.”
“About that,” Mandri said. “I can tell you right now that I’m not a—”
Salavan stopped him mid-sentence with a polite wave of his hand. He said, “You cannot tell me anything. I should say that I know more about you than you know about yourself.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“A thing to know about me, Mandri—I am straightforward and I do not lie because lying wastes time.”
“What’s my mother’s name?”
Salavan sneered and said, “I don’t pollute my mind with such trifles. The knowledge I have is more fundamental. Do you know a lizard’s mother’s name? No. Do you know more about a lizard than it knows about itself? Yes. Believe me when I say that you and every other dim-witted Spark don’t understand the first thing about what you truly are.” 
Mandri sighed. Salavan was no demon king, just another religious kook. A rich one. He wasn’t sure if he’d rather prefer the demon.
Salavan said, “I can see that you are going to need it explained. Come. We must study at least one piece of art. Come.”
Salavan led Mandri through a series of rooms, each with a ceiling higher than the one before. Common to the fashion of the Hrkan elite, what few furnishings there were, were muted. If there was a table, it was carved from a rough, pale sandstone. If there was a chair, its legs were simple, sanded branches, and its seat was woven reed. If there was a tapestry, it was devoid of color and image, for its purpose was to be a frame for the faded subtleties of Solraheen’s light, which at present was cold and dark, blueish-gray.
Eventually, Salavan led him into a cavernous room that had a circular cutout in its roof. A light rain suffused with silver sunlight streamed down through this hole to pitter-patter in a shallow rainwater pool on the floor. All edges of the room were laden with pillows upon pillows for comfort, all of them white with white tassels and stuffed inside ivory lace pillow cases.
On the other side of the column of rain was fresco that spanned the entirety of the wall. This painting was the object of Salavan’s march, and it was a magnificent work of art in skill and in subject. It depicted Solraheen at the very moment of His victory over evil—He was stretched out, as if flying, and his face wore a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his sword as He plunged it into His brother’s—Schisol’s—back. In the classic Hrkan style, Solraheen was pure white, and Schisol was an ashy black. The army of people surrounding them were cast in every color imaginable.
“This is my favorite piece.” Salavan said contentedly. “For sentimental reasons, mostly. The god of creation destroying the god of destruction. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? It has so much behind it, if you know what I mean.”
“I don’t.”
Salavan didn’t hear Mandri’s murmur.
“See this yellow?” he said. “Isn’t it beautiful?”
He was pointing to the golden rays which emanated out from Solraheen’s head. It truly was a fantastic yellow, extraordinarily vibrant, as if it had been painted on mere moments ago.
“Can you guess the pigment?”
Mandri answered, “I have no idea.”
“This yellow, it comes from the Gabo cow. Incredibly expensive. The most wasteful pigment imaginable. To make enough for this fresco I had to buy three men to care for fifty cows. I had to put them on a strict diet, the cows. They couldn’t eat anything but this little squeaking bug, called a zuberant. They look like locusts, but they are the thickness of your thumb, well, my thumb.”
“I’ve seen them.”
“They come in hives so they aren’t expensive. You make a paste out of them and feed this paste to the cows, and you have to stuff their bellies full all at once. That means you have to starve them a bit so they take to that bug-paste like dogs to the bone. Then you have to time the next step just right, because you see, this radiant pigment comes from the chyme of the cow’s third stomach, so you have to be precise with the cutting. You have wait until the chyme extrudes into that stomach, not the first or second stomach, the third stomach, and that’s when you cut open the beast and harvest as much of this yellow chyme as you can. Then, you dry it out into a powder, and that is that.”
“Interesting.”
“Once you have the powder, you can sell the meat. But I don’t sell the meat. I let it rot in the sun.”
“Why?”
“Because it feels…” Salavan waved his hand in the air as if to catch the words that could accurately describe what he was thinking. “It feels weighty to have killed a herd of beasts for the explicit purpose of painting my wall. Doesn’t Solraheen look radiant? And now that you know fifty cows died to make it seem so, doesn’t that make the fresco take on a more…Oh, I can’t find the words! It’s wonderful.”
“It doesn’t do anything for me.”
Salavan’s round face lit up and he laughed. “Hah! It doesn’t do anything for you, does it?! Well you can’t judge me boy, no one can. The gods are all dead. And here are the last of them, Schisol and Solraheen, and there—” he pointed to the top of the piece, to the screaming black comet in the sky, “There is the Fabled Black coming to end them both. Such a fine image, no? The quality of the painting is sublime, yes?”
“Sure.”
“Don’t be flippant, Mandri. It is beautiful. This is Ellag’s hand. I trust you are familiar with her work?”
“I am.”
“You know, she’s here. Would you like to see her?”
“Not really, no.”
“Unfortunate. Seeing her is the first step of your test.”
“A test?”
“Yes, a test. I trust Pell told you what this is all about?”
“Something about an Amalgamete.”
“Not an Amalgamete. The Amalgamete. Be respectful. The gods are all dead, but a new one arises. Your test will determine whether or not your Spark is ripe for a meeting.”
“Is the Amalgamete a good god or an evil god?”
Salavan turned towards Mandri expressed his exasperation through a sighing smile, as one might smile at a too-inquisitive child. He said, “Mandri, I’m surprised you haven’t learned the truth about good and evil. Good and evil, these are symptoms of a deeper fault in our natures, not causes in themselves. When He is done with His great work, there will be no question of who is good and what is evil, for all will be in accord with all.”
“That sounds evil.”
Salavan snorted a laugh. Mandri didn’t take kindly to it, and asked, “But what about Pell?”
“What about her?”
“She ripped out Gil’s stomach.”
“Who is Gil?”
“My ox.”
“Your ox? What is evil about that? Have you never chewed on a slab of tripe?”
“She didn’t eat the stomach. She ate Gil’s Spark.”
Salavan’s brows jumped and he reflexively muttered, “Interesting,” then added, “You mustn’t judge her, Mandri.”
“I saw what I saw.”
“I do not deny what you saw, but you did not understand what you saw. Pell was not consuming that Spark for sustenance.” He then frowned and said, “I can see there’s little hope in convincing you. Your mind is too bent by the Solitants. It is amazing how a few shameless twists of truth written down a few thousand years ago become woven into a culture’s sinew. Ancient lies reach right down to the core of it. Even the story of how Solraheen killed himself to kill Schisol is a lie.”
“Is that so?”
“It is. Solraheen called forth a stone of night from the sky to entomb Himself and His brother—it is a simple and neat story, but is it the truth? Does it even matter? No, and no. What do dead gods matter when a new god is being born?”
Salavan put his fat finger up on the fresco and poked Schisol’s belly, right where Solraheen’s sword burst forth.
A click sounded from under the floor, and a square of stone levered open to reveal a narrow stairway descending into darkness. 
Salavan said, “Before we head down, I must demand from you your utmost commitment. I, unlike the Solitants, value honesty, so my good character compels me to warn you that there is a chance—a chance—that as we attempt to squeeze your Spark for ripeness, you will die. It’s only a chance, and a small one at that. I want you to consider the thought before you join me.”
Salavan hiked up the hem of his robe, and disappeared down into the stairs.
Mandri stared down into that inky blackness, and not a thought went through his head. He must have stared for quite a while, because Salavan’s voice echoed up, saying, “I said consider the thought, not inhabit it!”
As Mandri stepped down the stairs, a servant girl bustled out from some narrow passage and closed the hatch behind him.
At the bottom of the stairs was a short tunnel, and at the end of this tunnel was a cramped room. In this room, set up against the far right corner, was a fire in a bronze brazier. Set up in the middle of the room were three wooden chairs, two facing one, and sitting in the two were Salavan, and a person draped in a white sheet.
“Don’t look so pale, Mandri,” Salavan sighed. “I told you not to come down here if you weren’t committed. You’ve come, and now you’re here, yes?”
Mandri nodded.
“Good. Sit down.” 
Mandri took the remaining seat, across from Salavan and the veiled stranger.
Salavan pulled the wrap of freeweed from his pocket, and he lit it in the brazier’s flames. He puffed it thrice to get it going.
“So!” he said as he slapped his leg to capture Mandri’s attention. “Are you infertile ground? The castrated painter? Or is it simply, the painter who doesn’t want to be a painter? You’d be surprised how many of those we find.”
Salavan puffed on his wrap.
Mandri simply sat there.
“Are your wits here, Mandri? Are you here?”
Mandri nodded.
“Use your voice. Assert yourself.”
Mandri cleared his throat, nodded towards the sheeted person, and said, “Who is that?”
“As I’ve said already, it is possible that you could die. Ellag died. I keep her around for the purpose of demonstration, and I think her presence will help put you into the right frame of mind.”
“That’s Ellag?”
Salavan’s chair creaked as he laid back into it. He blew a puff of smoke out the side of his mouth, as if the smoke could go anywhere in this cramped room. Between the freeweed and the fire, Mandri was having a hard time finding a clean breath.
Salavan crossed his tree-trunk legs and said, “Tell me, Mandri, what do you think Art is? If you could define it. Define Art.”
Mandri wondered what Salavan was playing at. He said, “Art is whatever you want it to be.”
“Don’t be coy, Mandri. This is important. You must be eased into the right frame of mind before we move on to the test itself.”
“I just don’t think it’s an interesting question, and I’m more concerned about what’s under that sheet.”
“Is that why you don’t want to paint anymore, you think it’s uninteresting?”
“More or less.”
“Which is it, more, or less? Be specific. You’ve spent too much time in front of an easel not to have some idea of what it is that you are doing.”
“I make pretty pictures.”
Salavan rolled his eyes and took a long drag from his wrap. He held the smoke in his great big chest, and when he finally exhaled, his round shoulders slumped like the essence life was leaving him.
“You think Art is merely a word,” he said. “You think that it’s a label that people slap onto things for utility.”
“I didn’t say that.”
“Then say something. I’m trying to help you avoid ending up like Ellag here.”
Salavan puts his arm around Ellag’s shoulder and gave her body a friendly shake. Her sheeted head rolled limply and then settled into the crook of Salavan’s shoulder as if she were looking to cuddle. As she did, the sheet pulled taught over her face, and as it did, a smear of blood welled up to stain the fibers.
Salavan narrowed his eyes and glared at Mandrameen. The air between them swirled with smoke. 
Salavan said, “Answer the question.”
“Is she dead?”
“Of course she’s dead. Answer the question.”
“What was the question?” 
Salavan sighed, then he steadied Ellag back onto her own chair so that he could lean forward and free his hands for explanation. He said, “Ellag thought that art was about the artist. A person goes out into the world and has some incredible experience—like you’re having now. It changes them in some important, fundamental way. They are a different person because of it. They look at the world differently. But how could any of their friends or family know that any of this has occurred? The change is internal. It is not written on the skin. There’s no new sparkle in the eye. Their behavior might be different, but that will never communicate the depth of what is going on inside the mind. Consider a woman crying—for what reason does she cry? She tells you her child has died, but you’ve never had a child, Mandri, so how could you understand? This is the problem which Art purports to solve. A work of art is an attempt to break through that impenetrable barrier between our minds.”
Not one word of that made it to Mandri’s ear. He was too focused on how excited Salavan was to speak. The man was so wrapped up in his words, and in the freeweed’s smoke, that Mandri wondered if he could make a dash for the stairs.
Salavan said, “That’s what Ellag thought. She thought that art is a thing an artist does to let everyone else to know what’s going on inside.”
Mandri nodded along.
“Does that make sense?”
“It’s very sentimental.”
“Isn’t it? Sentimental, yes, that would be a word for it. Unfortunately, it is completely and utterly wrong. Look how wrong it can be.”
Salavan bent down, grabbed the foot of Ellag’s sheet, and in one quick flourish, he flipped it over the back of her chair to reveal her corpse.
Her dead head bobbed and settled, and as it did a trickle of blood dripped out of the empty sockets that had once held her eyes. The belly of her tunic had been ripped apart, while the belly itself had been carved open with surgical care—skin folded back like a book to reveal a cavity under her ribs. The firelight flickered inside. Mandri could see her spine. She was hollowed out. 
“Steady, Mandri. Steady yourself… Now, looking at Ellag, you might be wondering what I am attempting to communicate with this work of art. You might suppose that I think that I am an artist, and that this,” he put his hand on Ellag’s skull and twisted it about in a perverse display of puppetry. “This is me communicating to you in a way that lets you experience, in a profound way, who I am and what it’s like to be me.”
He let go of Ellag’s head, and it slumped down onto her collarbone.
“But that would be a misunderstanding. Consider this—why isn’t speech, casual, conversational speech like we’re having now, why isn’t that considered to be Art? I am manipulating my throat, tongue, teeth, and lips to shape a string of sounds for you to experience. Sentences are things that can break down that barrier between our minds, yes?”
At this point the freeweed was having its way with Salavan. His arm’s gesticulations were growing frenetic. He cut the air with a slicing hand and said, “No. I am not an artist. I am many things, but I am not an artist.”
“You’re a murderer.”
“I’m not a murderer, either.”
Salavan took another big drag from his freeweed. The room was so small, and the smoke was so thick, that Mandri supposed it was getting to him too.
“Actually,” Salavan said, “that’s not true, I am a murderer. But I think you’re referring to Ellag, here. I did not kill Ellag. She died because she thought painting was about the artist. She thought that the painter was important. She thought far too much of herself.” He was now churning his words in the air with his free hand, as if mixing his musings with the smoke would bring out some flavor of the truth.
“You’re insane,” said Mandri.
“It is good that you should say that. Ellag was never able to make that step. She was too…she was too wrapped up in herself. Frightened.” He leaned forward a little in his seat. “See, if you look into the dark when you’re frightened, you’re bound to see frightening things.” 
Salavan made an explosion with his fingers, pretending to burst his eyes.
“Her eyes exploded?” Mandri asked.
“They did. It was fascinating.”
“What about her stomach?”
“Oh. That was me. All done after the fact, I assure you. Pell wanted to query the girl’s stomach. But we shouldn’t get distracted. I think you are about where you need to be.” He poked these words with his wrap of freeweed, shaking a clump of ash free from the glowing tip, causing Salavan to eye his wrap with some concern. He stood up, set it gently down onto the corner of his seat, and moseyed over to the far left corner of the room, hidden by Ellag’s shadow.
From the dark he pulled a huge square stone slab which was as black as the darkness in which it sat. Salavan struggled with it for a moment, then propped it up against his thighs and waddled it over. He set it down carefully at Mandri’s feet, and then he shuffled back into the dark to fetch three three clay jars. He set these down next to the black stone panel. In each jar was black paint.
Salavan pulled from his robe a paintbrush. Its handle was short, half as long as Mandri’s forearm—short, at least, compared to the length of the brush’s head, which was about the same length. It looked more like a miniature whip than a paintbrush. Salavan handed it to Mandri and said, “I want you to use these paints to paint a picture.”
“Of what?”
“Don’t think about what you are painting. Don’t give yourself that privilege. Don’t think about what should or shouldn’t be. You need to simply start painting.”
“You want me to figure things out as I go?”
“No. No. Don’t figure anything out. You are merely a tool. True art creates itself. It is reckoned with on its own terms. It is its own experience. It communicates nothing but what it is. You kneel here—” Salavan rubbed the floor in front of Mandri with his foot. “And you become the tool by which the work creates itself.”
Mandri squinted in confusion. None of that made a lick of sense. If he thought about nothing, then he would paint nothing. Even if he wanted to paint something, it would be hopeless, because in this dim light he wouldn’t be able to see what he was doing. And there were only the three black paints to put on a black slab of rock.
Salavan sat back down, and the sheer weight of him plopping onto his too-small chair disturbed Ellag’s corpse and she slumped forward over her knees. Her limp wrists smacked onto the floor.
“This test,” Salavan said thoughtfully, “Is a test to determine how skilled you are at removing yourself from yourself. Artists make the best divine instruments because of how practiced they are at becoming empty vessels, which a god can then make use of. Every time you paint, you suppress your own self, for you must look at the painting as if you had never seen it, as if you are completely oblivious to all the meaning you’ve nestled inside every brushstroke. You must do this because you wish to know how the painting will move on someone who is not you.” 
Mandri nodded as if Salavan was making sense. He then decided he better get it over with. Perhaps if he swirled some of the paint on the rock, then Salavan would let him leave. He knelt down before the black stone surface and thought about what he should do.
With no palette, the stone itself would have to be the palette. It wasn’t like he was going to run into trouble mixing paints if the only color was black. One by one one, he picked up the clay jars and, trembling, he poured their contents onto the stone surface. The only difference between these paints, it seemed, was their viscosity. The first paint came out of its jar in a clump. It slopped onto the stone like a sandy gel. Mandri could see little granules of Fabled Black sparkling in the firelight. The next paint was a clean, syrupy goo that drizzled out of the jar. The last paint was so thin that he had to be careful pouring it out, lest it splash all over the place. Thankfully, the surface of the stone was ever so slightly bowled.
When Mandri was done with all this, he cast a side-eyed glance at Salavan to see if the man approved of what he was doing.
Salavan glared back and said, “Don’t look at me, look at the work.”
Mandri’s breathing grew nervy, and the smoke in the air was stifling. He fanned his tunic—light as the linen was, the room's heat had become unbearable. He knew that Salavan was looking for him to do a specific something, and if he didn’t do it, he would not be allowed to leave.
“What will happen if I fail?” he asked.
Salavan shook his head and said, “Think, instead, of what will happen if you should succeed. If you can work, and let yourself be used by the work, then I am going to stick you onto a wagon, full of artists like yourself, and it shall cross the Sand and lead you to the Amalgamete. You shall meet Him in the flesh! Think of it—meeting a god! He will make you into a champion!”
“But what should I paint?”
This, Salavan did not answer. He took another drag of his freeweed and reclined back into his chair. He looked away, studied his own smoke, as if he was alone in the room.
Mandri turned his attention back to the slathered-black stone. 
What could he possibly paint with black, on top of black, on top of black?
He poked the long-haired brush into the sandy gel and spread it around. It did not mix with the other paints, it pushed right through them, and the thinner paints in turn flooded into the grooves left by the brush’s passing.
He sat back on his heels and studied the whorl he’d made. The sheen of the orange firelight played with each paint differently. It stuck softly to the fine grained gel, it stippled the syrupy fluid, and it hardly touched the thinnest paint. Wherever the thinnest paint pooled, the image was truly black.
Mandri began to push and pull the paints around to build an image out of the light, as a sculptor might build an image out of shadows. He didn’t much care about what he was making, the brush hairs were too long and too limp to be too deliberate.
What was he making?
Black pools welled up like the hollows of human eyes.
A face, why not?
A stripe of shadow for the upper lip.
Mound up the gel to bring out the cheeks.
It was coming along.
A long and powerful face.
Mandri swirled the brush around in an eye socket, trying to find an eye.
Suddenly, there it was, an eye of firelight.
It blinked.
Mandri startled backwards in fright. He quickly gathered his wits and peered disbelievingly down at that fire-flickering eye.
The thinnest stream of black ran down below the upper lip, opening the mouth, drawing Mandri’s eye.
Was there a tongue in there? A black snake of a tongue glinting in the back of the throat?
Yes. There it was.
“Do you see this?” Mandri asked, but no response came.
He looked up to see what Salavan was doing, but Salavan was not there. Neither was the dead woman. Neither were the chairs, or the walls, or the room—there was only Mandri, the fire, the face, and the void.
Suddenly, the face began to extrude up out of the stone, dripping in Fabled Black. Mandri scrambled backwards on all fours. When the black head was fully in the round it tilted down to stare at Mandri. Its eyes were a rainbow fire and its gaze consumed him. Mandri could feel his Spark tug against his stomach, as if it were being pulled. He screamed, but no sound came out. A pressure grasped at his throat, like a pair of strangling hands, and this force jerked him backwards, and backwards again, and suddenly, he was yanked out of the void.
When Mandri opened his eyes again, he was stunned to see that he was back in Salavan’s basement. It was Salavan’s hands on his throat, and it was Salavan’s face hovering over his own.
“What did you see?” Salavan asked as he shook Mandri.
Mandri’s brow was pouring with sweat. 
“I saw—I saw a face.”
Salavan studied the painted slab, then muttered a single, breathless word, “Incredible...”
Mandri tried to pull himself free from Salavan’s grip, but the man did not let go. Instead, Salavan roared and threw his great weight down upon Mandri and pinned him against the ground. Mandri heaved and wiggled but it was all for not, for Salavan was strong.
“Hold still, Mandrameen! Hold still!”
Salavan jabbed his elbow into Mandri’s stomach and leaned his great weight into it, squeezing the air from Mandri’s lungs. Tears streamed down Mandri’s face and his chest burned in agony. Salavan’s meaty hands clamped tight on Mandri’s throat and they squeezed with all their might.
Salavan’s plump smile savored every desperate wheeze.
“I knew your Spark was ripe the moment I saw you,” he muttered.
A few juddering moments later, and Mandrameen’s body was dead.</Text>
            <Notes>Add bit about artist must look at the work both through their own eyes, and through the eyes of the audience.



It is amazing how a shameless twist of truth written down a few thousand years ago becomes a foundational pillar of orthodox belief. 


“You mean the Mazydai?”
“I mean abominations. Think of it, Mandri, if it weren’t for the power of the Mazydai which has been pulled from the flesh of Solraheen, the Hrks would never have conquered the outland tribes. </Notes>

            <Title>Mandri's Demon</Title>
            <Text>The next morning, when Mandri was sure no one would notice, he stole himself away, ducked behind a bush, used a thorn to poke a hole in the tip of his God’s Eye burgeon. He dabbed one meager droplet of its juice onto his tongue—no more than that. The idea was to escape himself and liven up the day’s journey, not end up catatonic like before. And as the sun had just bobbed up above the horizon, the drug’s dissociative effects would kick in right around mid-morning, right when the heat would start to get under his robe.
He plugged the tiny hole he’d made in the burgeon with a tiny thorn from the bush, and he stuffed the blessed fruit into his robe to save for later. If he rationed it carefully he could make the juice last for a week. He would roll the rest of the burgeon flat and dry it out, and from there he’d experiment to discover the best method of ingestion. Then, maybe, he could steal another.
He rejoined the march through the vast expanse of emptiness. He avoided idle conversation, for he was intent on documenting the peculiarities of God’s Eye sight as it came. Thankfully, the world around him possessed no black splotches to fall into, nothing like that sooted ceiling in Seb’s cave. The darkest colors were the purplish shadows cast by scattered sandstone rocks, but as the sun continued to rise, these shadows shifted blue to match the richness of the sky.
A whole hand passed and nothing happened.
Mandri wondered if he needed to double the dose, but he was scared to do it. It wouldn’t end well for him if he took too much and collapsed into the Sand. 
Seb would search his robes.
She’d find the burgeon.
That wasn’t the plan, so he soldiered on.
Mandri licked his lips because his mouth was dry. Burgeons have a way of doing that, but so does the sun. The ground in this part of the desert was a few shades nearer to white, so it reflected the sun a few shades nearer to unbearable. He could feel his face hardening into that squint that every outland poke wore the world over. It hurt to look in any direction but up.
This limitation added some difficulty to his quest of cataloging the effects of the burgeon. He didn’t suspect that a good measure of this blinding brightness was due to the burgeon itself, and he only realized it when the whole world flashed white.
He blinked in shock, and this only triggered another flash as a purer, shimmering divine light flooded his sight from the periphery inward.
He gasped and shut his eyes tight, but closed, his vision boiled with that light, a whiteness which churned and split into an iridescent swirl.
When he opened his eyes again the world was not the same.
What he saw was a desert bright and glistening. It was like burgeonsight but grander, for more than a mere glisten, he saw a web of iridescent threads winding around the world and joining to the fibrous threads which tufted up from the skin of every surface. Rainbow filaments carpeted the sand like grass, covered the rocks, covered the entire world off to the infinite distance. Everything bristled with these flighty fibers, and somehow Mandri knew what they were—divine lines of unveiled purpose, connecting cause and effect. These were lines which traced the future of all living and non-living things.
Ayram and Moto walked in front, and Mandri could see their Sparks shimmering inside their stomachs, and the space between their swinging arms was webbed with iridescent threads. They moved apart, and the threads connecting their robes stretched and split, then reached and rejoined, and through it all, the two men’s Sparks stayed linked by a thicker, brighter string, and each had other thicker strings stretching out into the world.
Two of these numinous lines were connected to Mandri, for down inside his own stomach was a white-hot knot of shimmering light whose edges glittered red, green, and blue. He moved to touch it, and as his fingers approached, translucent hairs connecting them to his Spark shimmered into being, as if they’d always been there, for this moment was the fulfillment of purpose.
His fingers stopped at his skin. This came as a surprise, for he expected to be able to sink his fingers inside to brush his Spark.
He swung his foot up over the ground in front of him, and threads seemed to spring up from the sand, as if alive, and they latched onto the sole of his shoe.
“Incredible.”
He looked behind and saw that his Spark was connected to Moteah’s, and hers and his were connected to Elrahet’s, and everyone’s was connected to everyone else’s, each as bright as every other, save for Elrahet’s, whose Spark outshone them all. Indeed, her Spark nearly outshone the sun which rose into the sky behind her.
More than anyone else Elrahet was enmeshed in a beautiful, complex web of purpose, and these fibers, every one, were hereby joined in Mandrameen’s eye, for his sight was the spindle that bound them together into a yarn which wound around his mind and back out through his iris and into the world, a wire spun tight and then unraveled, a continuous threading and rethreading of purpose.
Mandri lamented the lack of materials, for he was struck by an overwhelming urge to record the moment. If he’d only had a stick of charcoal and a sheet of paper he could start sketching right then and there, and if he didn’t sketch it out now as he saw it, details would be forgotten. After one night’s sleep they’d be lost forever, and that was terrifying, for the moment was pleading with him to be given its own sacred body—an image in a frame—so that it might move about the world and inject the moment’s purpose into every future moment.
But how could he capture this light by scribbling with ash? Or even colored paint? Reality conspired against him. It was hopeless to even try.
“Keep walking,” Elrahet grumbled as she passed him. The wind flicked the hem of her desert-bitten robe, stretching and snapping filaments of purpose.
Then he noticed one thin, shimmering strand of purpose extend from out of Elarhet’s Spark and shoot straight up into the sky. He followed its path and saw it touch a vulture which wheeled overhead. Elrahet had more threads connecting to her than there were living things around them. She was a locus for this web of purpose. Some threads dug into the sand, to lizards or snakes or fleas. Some spread out into the horizon to peoples and creatures unknown. One thread was of particular interest, for it ended in a rock some fifty yards away—a natural, red, sway-backed block of sandstone. The sand was littered with similar slumpy boulders, but only one drew a thread of purpose into its core, and it was a bright thread, a Sparked thread, as bright as any connecting to the Ayramun.
Mandri walked towards it to investigate.
That’s when he noticed that sound vibrated these threads. The faint scream of the vulture above, the sparkling sizzle of sand sweeping, the thupping of leather-bound feet sprinting along the sand. The sound of Moteah’s voice yelling.
Yelling what?
“Are you blind!?”
A hand grabbed his shoulder and yanked him back, and he fell on his ass. 
Moteah didn’t give Mandri time to complain about the interruption, for she grabbed onto Obo’s litter and began pulling them both away from that curious rock. This action made Mandri realize that he hadn’t yet seen what Obo looked like, and he desperately wanted to know how Obo’s pseudospark fit into this vision.
“Let go!” he shouted, but Moteah only stopped when she was satisfied. When she did let go she stumbled back and screamed, “Are you insane!?”
By now the others had doubled back and joined the girl. Mandri couldn’t see their faces, for all they all were snared in silken cocoons of purpose.
“I told you he’s got a dim Spark,” said Moto.
Mandri, realizing he should say or do something normal to hide his jumped-upness, blurted out, “What’s going on?”
Moteah picked up a loose pebble, then side-armed it at the boulder that Mandri had been hunting.
The pebble smacked into the boulder’s side.
The boulder flinched and hissed as it flashed its yellow fangs.
A demon!
It was a red demon with flat, rock-patterned scales that melted into each other as it settled back into its hunched back squat. The creature blended in so neatly with all the sandstone boulders scattered about, that Mandri’s addled mind hadn’t seen it for what it was.
He squinted in an attempt to discern its features. He noticed the organic line of corded muscle roping around its shoulders, and these were human shoulders which sprouted human arms, or rather, human-ish, for the creature was the size of a dog, and its hands were curled and clawed like those of a long-lived pillow lizard, those favored pets of outland kings. Its face was a mixture of the grotesque. It had the scrunched-up snout of a flat-faced pig, the nose and drooling flews of a hunting hound, and ugliest of all was its outsized skull, a human skull with deep sockets framing yellow, snake-slitted eyes that stared unblinking at the crowd.
Then he saw its Spark. Unlike the others, it was a twist of color, burning red and pink. It had a line connected to him.
“Kill it!” Mandri shouted.
The Ayramun all laughed.
“Not worth the effort,” said Seb.
“But it’s a demon!”
“You have a sword, don’t you?” said Moto, snorting. “If you want to kill it, then kill it.”
Mandri could almost feel the demon’s teeth sinking into his flesh, scratching another nick into his thigh bone.
“Demons is hard to kill,” Ayram asserted. “Easy to wound, but if that’s all you do then you have to chase it.”
“It…it…it,” Mandri stammered, unable to express a cogent thought.
“Calm down,” said Seb. “Demons are dumber than Schisol’s shadow. They’ve got no pride when they’re alone.”
Moto added, “You’ll be fine as long as you don’t present yourself as meat.”
Mandri couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He’d heard a million rumors about demons, and not one suggested that they were dumb.
Seb said, “Moteah hit it with a rock and the damned thing thinks we can’t see it. I got eye contact, and it still thinks I don’t know it’s there.”
Ayram reached down, grabbed an Ayram-sized throwing stone and turned the heavy thing around in his hand until he found a good grip. He fixed his gaze upon the demon, and his long arm whipped and zipped that rock straight at that demon’s mouth.

SMACK!

The rock exploded into fragments and dust, and the demon shrieked as it flew backwards into a tumble. Blood gargled out of its smashed up snout as it tried to scramble upright, but Ayram’s stone had robbed its legs of confidence. It juddered, slipped, and fell again. It was such a broken mess that Mandri almost felt bad for it. 
Eventually it staggered up on all fours, then limp-sprinted away, zig-zagging left and right as if unsure of which way to flee. Then it came to a sudden stop and squatted back down in the dirt, re-assuming the shape of a rock.
It was hidden—or so it thought.
“Makes good target practice,” Ayram muttered.
Then a bright idea flashed in his wild eyes. “Let’s have Mandri have a go.”
He grabbed Mandri and lifted him up, then lifted Obo’s litter off his back, then spun the Mazid around so that Obo faced the demon.
“Summon the Mazidfire.”
Mandri heard the command but paid it no heed, for he was stunned by the sight of Obo, whose pseudospark glowed dim in his distended stomach. A thread connected Mandri to Obo, and it was thick, the thickness of a finger, and it was brighter than any other in sight. A white light throbbed through it, sourced from Mandri’s Spark, and where it merged through Obo’s pseudospark, that white exploded into a web of shifting color which pulsed in waves through all of Obo’s skin, revealing contours of his scrawny, severed self underneath his robes. 
The color was richest in Obo’s revealed face, where his once-white skin now glistened with iridescent purpose. And his eyes, the sheen of his silver eyes was subsumed by a flow of rainbowed color.
“Go on,” said Obo, oblivious to his stunning beauty.
A grumbled sigh broke out behind him.
It was Elrahet. So wrapped was she in purpose that she seemed little more than a standing spool of glowing yarn. She waddled towards Mandri, and she seemed to drag the world along with her. 
“Focus,” she said. “Breathe.”
Mandri sipped a breath to recompose himself. 
Then he realized that she was about to enthrall him as she’d done before in that pit, and his fear was realized when her bony hand jutted out of the threads wrapping around her, and in that hand was a golden knife.
She slashed the air in front of Mandri’s stomach, and in one swift stroke, the threads connecting Mandri’s Spark to everyone else’s were severed.
His whole body pulsed with color and his mind slumped into its seat.
His Spark had only one bright string left, the one connecting him to Obo.
“Think of nothing but the Mazid,” she mumbled. 
Mandri had no choice.
The witch began to circle, and as she did she pruned Mandri’s handless arm of purpose.
“Reach out with your arm,” she said, and her words tugged at the severed fibers lining his arm, weaving them into a new purpose.
He reached out.
He could feel his missing hand as if it were still there, and he could feel it squeezing Obo’s heart, squeezing it in time with the pulse of his own Spark.
He poured all his energy into that hand, and when he did, Obo’s bald head twitched.
“Summon the fire!” Elrahet shrieked, and Mandri felt his Spark burn.
An urge welled up his stomach, and Obo’s shoulders crimped. That urge spread through Mandri’s whole body and sped through his arm, and as it did, a faint golden glow began to shine through the skin of Obo’s throat.
The Mazid opened his mouth towards the heavens, and as just as Mandri’s eye caught sight of a spark of golden fire, a searing pain shot through his severed wrist and he shrieked, “EAUUUGGHH!!!”
It felt as if the circle of the sun had fallen from the heavens and sliced right through his missing hand.
He collapsed and twisted in pain.
Through the agony he heard Moto say, “Interesting. He almost did it.”
Mandri writhed around for a finger more, clutching his severed wrist against his chest. By the time he was back inside his own skin, only Ayram and Obo remained. The rest had resumed their journey.
“That’s good enough for now,” said Ayram, and he left as well.
When Mandri sat up, the God’s Eye sight was gone.</Text>
            <Notes>Later, Mandri and Obo chat about what happened. - ithink I know why she chose me - she can control me. It was so easy for her.
It seems like I can do it.
It wasn’t me, it was her.
The pain.


HERE the mazidfire is golden.


Mandri suceeds but supresses?

 of unveiled purpose

The pain obo must feel

- does that happen every time? 

Yes.

A friend’s daughter ran to give me a hug. She headbutted me in the uglies. It was the worst pain I ever felt. The dull ache lasted for a month.

Mandri shuffled his legs underneath him into a frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up.

            <Synopsis>!</Synopsis>
            <Text>Mandri stretched out his legs in a futile attempt to recover from the rigor of death. He wanted to stand up and walk around, but he was forced by circumstance to sit and wait in the bottom of the Ayramun’s limestone pit. He watched the sun as it crossed over to noon, such that its light shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. By then, most of the Ayramun had retreated into the tunnel. Forty stayed to keep watch over Mandri, and Mandri stayed because he thought he was supposed to. But he preferred the warmth. He set his back against the rock and shut his eyes, and he had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd of brown ragged pokes came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, away from Mandri, chattering excitedly like children. 
Mandri watched them blather, tried to pick up some hints about what was going on, then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention.
Out of the shadowed tunnel came Ayram.
Mandri had never seen a man so big.
He’d seen giants in paintings, but those were paintings. Those giants were Hrkan Lords painted to be twice their actual size, an unreality meant to lift up ordinary rulers in the eyes of their subjects. It was a genre known as ‘the conquering hero’, and it was a tired genre, a joke even amongst the Lords who knew they were ordinary men. And Mandri agreed. He’d never once spared an admiring thought for these men. The first thought that came to Mandri’s mind when he saw Ayram was, ‘Oh, shit,’ and the second was the more considered, ‘This must be Arnaggu’.
Arnaggu was the first Hrkan Lord, a true conquering hero, the inspiration for the genre. In some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towered above the windswept Forni plain. It was a terrifying piece. The relief itself sat four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicted stretched all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image was a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen dressed in the garb of slaves—naked torsos and skirted hips. Their limbs are splayed out like flattened lizards. Their faces are fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu’s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is depicted ten times larger than any other, and he stood at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage. His upper torso and head were the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seemed to be tearing himself out of the rock, eyes wild but brow untroubled, the look of royal rage, as if he’d just heard whispers of rebellion and was dead-set on cutting out the treacherous tongues with his blade.
Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen, and at first blush a prickling sense of awe stippled his skin. To contend with Arnaggu was to contend with the entirety of the rock.
Ayram looked like Arnaggu reborn, a true giant, with a stern countenance seemingly carved from stone. His hair was wrapped up in a black headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, black, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet Unkileen, who was himself named after a mountain. Ayram wasn’t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens. And the way he moved, with his too-long legs wrapped in faded black wool and swinging in a loping gait, he seemed possessed of that skinny-legged power that hides inside a horse.
Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, the man carried the body of a conquered wretch under his arm. This was none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo, whose bald head was twisted the right way around. Obo’s silver eyes blinked in the sun, and set against Ayram’s bronzed skin and black robes, his naked, chalk-white flesh was gleaming.
Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him. All of them stared at their master’s capture like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for a greasy hand to divvy up the meal. The awkward nakedness of Obo’s body drew hearty jeers. Weeg was quick to point out that this Mazid didn’t have an asshole.
“No wonder he acts like his shit don’t stink,” he said, smirking.
“It do when it come out the mouth,” said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.
“Bet it does!” Tob roared. He then slapped his knee and killed the joke by hitting it square in the face. “Shit comes out its mouth because it's full of shit!”
His belly-rumbling laugh was followed by a storm of obscenities that rained down upon poor Obo—almost all the Ayramun joined in. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.
Obo bore their insults with the bearing of a bullied child who’d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo stood up and smiled, almost gloating, and this triggered a roar of fury and renewed calls for the Obo’s head on a spike.
Ayram settled his people down with a shrill and sharp two-fingered whistle. 
He then turned to the cave from which he’d come and he shouted, “Elrahet!”.
His voice was deep and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous chest, and already echoed before they’d even left his lips, giving the unsettling impression that two men spoke at once..
An old woman’s voice came grumbling back from the cave.
“Sol’s light, I’m coming.”
A witch came hobbling out of the dark, clouded in a mass of ruffled black tatters, and leaning on a thigh-high cane of withered driftwood. She kept her shawled head downcast in deference, and with her spine as bowed as it was, she was no taller than Ayram’s hip.
She joined the Ayramun’s circle, completing it. As soon as she was settled, Ayram worked his piercing gaze upon the rest of his people, and eventually his eyes landed on Mandri.
“And you,” he said, “Come here.”
Forty pushed Mandri up, and whispered, “Go on.”
Mandri scuffled across the sand, passed a smirking Obo, and he stood before the giant, suddenly aware that everyone’s eyes were on him.
“What’s your name, boy?”
“Mandri.”
“Look at me, Mandri.”
Mandri looked up and tried to find Ayram’s eyes against a backdrop of blue-bright sky.
“You been crying, boy? ”
Mandri shook his head.
“Why are your eyes red and witless, puffy?”
The old witch stepped forward, steadied herself on her gnarled cane and said, “His body has not yet recovered from death. His face is still stuffed with blood.” The shadow of her cowl hid a sneering squint that folded so much age around her eyes that the eyes themselves were little more than black seeds thumb-pressed into her sockets. And those seeds were moving, they flitted underneath those wrinkles, studying the outline of Mandri’s figure as if they could see the smell of death exuding out from him. Eventually they fixed on his wounded arm.
“How is it?” she asked flatly.
Mandri raised his poulticed wrist. The sight of it alone was sickening, for the once-white linen was stained brown and black, and tufts of rotted vegetative matter sprouted out between the gaps in the slap-dash wrapping, and oozing out alongside was a dark, unsightly ooze.
“I don’t feel a thing,” Mandri muttered as he turned it over, marveling at the incongruity between sight and feeling. Indeed, he felt nothing at all, not only an absence of pain, but an absence of anger, too—these bandits had cut off his hand and he didn’t much care, though that probably had something to do with Ayram’s intimidating presence.
“That’s good,” said Ayram.
“It’s bad,” the witch corrected. “He must feel the hand to work it.”
“It’s no matter,” said Ayram, inflecting his words with encouragement as he set his own great hand upon Mandri’s shoulder. He then turned Mandri around to face Obo and the rest of the Ayramun.
“I want you to command it,” he said. “You have been made this Mazid’s Minder. Command it to kneel to me. If you command it to do anything other than kneel, I’m going to crush your spine.”
Ayram’s hand shifted to the back of Mandri’s neck. The calloused weight of it swallowed Mandri’s own soft and sinewy self, and when Ayram gave a slight, yet terrifying squeeze, Mandri nearly yelped.
“So, I just…tell him to kneel?”
“Yes.”
Mandri had seen a Minder only once before, and that was a fleeting glimpse. He’d never seen a Minder voice a command. His own word was never enough to compel anyone to do anything, so why it should work now was a mystery. 
“Tell the creature to kneel,” Ayram urged.
Obo’s pale skin was blinding in the brightness of noon-day sun. Mandri stared, and like some god-touched idiot he tried to summon some guiding sensation which might uncover some hidden instinct, if indeed he had been endowed with such a thing, but all he felt was the weight of Ayram’s hand on the back of his neck. 
He took a deep breath, steadied himself, and hoping to get it over with, he issued a soft but direct, “Kneel.” It was a command, but a pleading one, almost apologetic. While that was the only kind of command that Mandri respected, it did not have the desired effect. Obo did not move. Instead, he cocked his ear and asked, “Could you say that again? I didn’t quite catch your meaning.”
Mandri risked an over-the-shoulder glance at the giant who towered up behind him. All he could see of Ayram’s head from this angle was that bread-loaf beard, as well as a sharp nose poking out.
Mandri muttered, “It seems he doesn’t want to kneel.”
Ayram squeezed Mandri neck again and bellowed, “That was no command. Puff out your chest! Say it with conviction. Think of yourself as a fat Junkite Queen hungry for meat.”
Before Mandri could do any of this, the witch Elrahet ambled into view. Her knees slapped the black tatters of her robe, sending the robe’s ragged hem swinging to and fro. Her eyes still fretted over Mandri’s figure. She stood before him, between him and Obo, and she waved Ayram away with a flick of her knobby fingers. The giant grunted but obeyed.
Then she began to circle Mandri as a vulture circles its meal. As she moved she mumbled a guttural speech devoid of natural pauses where she might take a breath, and this flow of mumblings had a stupefying effect, such that Mandri felt his thoughts and feelings leave him. By the second circling he was so far removed from the moment that he almost didn’t see the witch’s right hand plunge into her ragged robes and emerge with a curved, golden knife.
It was a knife he had seen before.
In fact, it looked exactly like the knife that the demon witch Pel had used to slaughter Gil.
“Stare at the Mazid,” Elrahet growled when she noticed him noticing her. “Think of nothing but the Mazid.”
Mandri’s eyes instinctively flicked to Obo, but thinking of him was difficult to do because he had seen Elrahet lick her withered lips at the sight of his stomach. And she was holding that accursed knife. It was in the light of the sun.
“Look at the Mazid!” Elrahet snipped. “Nothing but the Mazid! Nothing but the Mazid.”
She lashed out with her blade faster than Mandri could flinch, and the blade sliced the air right in front of his belly-button. Mandri stiffened, an involuntary jerk, and now it was clear that this witch was ensorcelling him through her speech. He could actually feel Elrahet’s grating words pulling his mind down out of its perch and into a pleasant quietness, where nothing existed but the sight of Obo. It was an effect he had felt before when he’d sipped too much juice from a rotted bushel of black-spotted burgeons, it was a narrowing of the world between Mandri and his object of interest. But the witch was not done. She continued to circle, and every time her mumblings crescendoed into a witchy bark, she’d lash out with her blade and slash the air just above Mandri’s skin—above his arm, his shoulder, right in front of his nose—and each time Mandri felt some part of himself snap, as if every time she cut the air she cut one of his desires, unmooring his mind from the future so that it would drop a little further down into this trance. Soon it seemed that the only functional parts of him were his legs, which kept him standing, and his vision, though that, too, was blurring, as the limestone pit had dissolved into a whitish pucker behind Obo’s unfinished face.
A strange, bald face.
It needed eyebrows.
“Command it to kneel,” Elrahet snarled. “Shout it!”
An urge bubbled up out of Mandri’s gut and he vomited out a shout, “Kneel!”
The word that flew out of his mouth was not his own, or at least it seemed that way to his inner ear. He supposed it was magic, for the word shivered the sand underneath his feet, and a cool air blew up from nowhere and billowed the hem of his robe. And more than that, when the word passed out of his throat it wrenched at the Spark inside his stomach, and he wheezed as his insides twisted, doubling him over in pain.
When he caught his breath he looked up, and Obo was still standing, watching him. The effort seemed to amuse him. “Come now, Mandri,” he said with a relaxed smile. “If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
Ayram’s great hand gripped Mandri’s shoulder again and straightened him out.
“Again.”
Mandri clutched his stomach and nearly fainted.
“Feel for your hand,” Elrahet stressed as she waddled again into view. “You must use your hand. Feel for the pulse in your fingers and squeeze.” She motioned for Mandri to raise his arm and he did, he held that weedy poultice out before him as she began again to circle. He struggled against the witch’s mumblings as they dragged him back down into her thrall. He aimed his handless wrist at the Obo as if it were a weapon, and his mind ricocheted off the monstrous thought that his movements were not his own and he plunged into a vision of his severed hand stuck inside Obo’s chest. His pale, dead fingers were squeezing a malformed slug of muscle that passed for a heart.
“KNEEL!” He screamed, and the concussive word rattled the pit’s chalky walls then rebounded right back at him, shaking his own hardened heart in its cage and speeding into the cave behind, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back out. That this powerful shout had come from him was the least incredible thing, for the air between himself and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if his very shout had somehow thwacked the dusty ground between like an invisible whip.
Obo’s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether, and for a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Mandri’s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. 
“Almost!” said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had stolen all of Mandri’s strength. Mandri wobbled and collapsed to his knees for his insides felt like they had imploded and his handless wrist felt like it was burning.
“Oh,” said Obo, a smirk playing on his lips. “Is that what you wanted me to do?”
Mandri couldn’t breathe. He floundered in the sand, gasping.
Ayram strolled right on by and glowered over pale little Obo.
“Why are you not kneeling?” he asked the Mazid.
Obo stood defiant. “I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
Ayram pointed down at Mandri. “He is your Minder, yes?”
“He is.”
“Then why are you not kneeling?”
“His will is weak,” Obo said as if it were a matter of obvious fact.
Mandri buried his face into the crook of his arm as he cowered against the gawking stares of the Ayramun.
“In truth,” said Obo, “A Minder cannot command a Mazid to do anything. A Minder can only stop me from doing something they don’t want me to do.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then said, “What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which.”
There was another pause, and when Mandri peeked out he saw Obo’s face wrinkled in amusement. Obo said, “If you are unsatisfied, you can always try again, but I tell you, you’ve chosen the wrong man to be Minder.”
Ayram spun around. Mandri cringed, fearing the giant’s boot would come down on him, but Ayram was looking to his witch.
“Why the boy?” he asked.
Elrahet grunted. “You would doubt my judgment, now of all times?”
“I need to know.”
Elrahet grunted again. She shuffled nearer. Mandri thought he could hear her old bones jangling inside her skin. She said, “A Minder’s connection to their Mazid is a leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash to achieve some measure of control. This boy here lacks that training. Everyone here lacks that training. So it is no surprise that with him the leash is long. It will require time and effort on my part to focus him.”
From the way Ayram scrunched his brow, this explanation was just on the verge of being acceptable. “If the boy has no control, then why hasn’t the Mazid burnt us all with its fire?”
“As I’ve said before,” said Elrahet, voice weary and annoyed, “Mazidfire dwells in the Mazid, but it belongs to the Minder and only a strong Minder can wield it. As the boy is not yet strong, the Mazidfire is no danger. But commanding the Mazid to kneel, that he should be able to do.”
“Why can’t he?”
“It may be as the Mazid says—his will is weak. But sure as mudgrass grows in mud, his will shall return to him.”
Ayram gritted his teeth as he chewed on the witch’s words. This did not seem to be an acceptable answer. When he turned his attention to Obo, he said aloud, “Someone toss me a dagger.”
A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram’s feet. Ayram picked it up, and the blade was no bigger than a butterknife when compared to Ayram’s hand. The giant set the blade’s edge up tight against the side of Obo’s neck.
“Kneel,” he said brusquely.
Obo was unmoved. “Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from my new Minder.”
Ayram rotated the dagger so that its sharp point was digging into Obo’s white skin. “If you don’t do what I want, then I have no use for you.”
“Then I suggest you direct your attention towards your choice of Minder.”
Ayram pushed the dagger’s tip into Obo’s flesh, more in curiosity than cruelty. It was a scene reminiscent of some sword-swallower’s trick—the blade was inches deep in Obo’s neck, and while Obo’s whole body was tense his face was completely unconcerned. And when Ayram withdrew the blade, only a few drops of blood trickled out from the wound.
Elrahet stepped forth once again and cleared her throat. “This is unneeded. The boy will control the creature in time. If he is unable, I will find someone who will.” 
“We don’t have time for that!” Ayram exclaimed as he shrugged her away and began to pace back and forth. His left hand clasped his right behind his back, while his right hand twirled the bone-handled blade like a toothpick in between dexterous fingers. It was a grand show of furious thinking, one which went on for far too long, though everyone was keen to indulge it. Eventually, he stopped right before Mandri’s downcast face—Ayram’s leather boots were the same width as Mandri’s own head.
“You are free to speak,” said Ayram.
Mandri lay silent for a respectful moment, then looked up and asked, “What do you want me to say?”
Ayram squatted down so that his great head blocked out the sun. “Were you always soft, or did dying do that to you? It couldn’t have been a bad death as you’re all in once piece.”
Mandri didn’t answer, so Ayram asked, “You ever killed anyone before?”
Mandri shook his head no.
“You ever killed a goat? A pig? Anything bigger than a rat?”
“I was a painter.”
Ayram sighed and stood back up. He said, “Of course you were. Did my people explain to you what this is all about?”
“No.”
Ayram rolled his eyes and chastised his people with disappointed glare. He said to Mandri, “I need you to use that Mazid’s fire to kill a demon. You know what a demon is, don’t you?”
Mandri nodded.
“I don’t speak of some storytime, feather-plucking demon. It is the demon of demons—a beast called the Amalgamete. If you are unwilling or unable to kill it, then I have no use for you. Is that clear?”
The bone-handled blade dripped a drop of blood onto Mandri’s robe.
“I may interject,” said Obo. “I have a potential solution to this little quandary we all find ourselves in.” 
“Do you?” Ayram asked, feigning interest.
“It seems that I have something you want, and you happen to have something that I want.”
“What I want you can’t give.”
“You want my fire to destroy some imagined enemy, and yes, given present circumstances, I cannot control my fire, but if circumstances were to change…”
“Get to the point.”
“How about a bargain?”
A few chuckles rose from the Ayramun, and Mandri thought he knew why—Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his. Ayram stared the Mazid square and said quite bluntly, “I don’t bargain with Hrks.”
“Then don’t call it bargaining,” Obo replied. “We’ll share gestures of goodwill. We can start small, if you like. I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don’t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. Give me a mouthful of water and I will kneel. I will grovel, if you like.”
“How is this going to get me Mazidfire?”
“I guarantee you, I will kill whatever you want if you give me what I want.”
“That so?”
“It is.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the nearby Ayramun and demanded their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram snatched it out of the air, and he unplugged the cork and took a drink. His beard bulged as he swished the water around his mouth, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he wondered aloud, “I didn’t know the Mazidai needed water.”
“We don’t,” Obo answered. “Again, this is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of goodwill.”
“You first,” said Ayram. “Give us a gesture of goodwill, to demonstrate the principle.”
Obo promptly dropped to one knee and bowed his head. And there was no mockery in it—this bend of body and limb was honest, pure obeisance.
“Beautiful,” Ayram mused as he took a moment to appreciate the gesture. “But it goes against my nature to give water to a Hrk.”
He let the statement hang in the air, and when Obo raised his eyes in aggravation, Ayram tossed the waterskin. A chorus of mumbled grumbles sounded out as the waterskin, that sign of goodwill, flew through the air and landed against Obo’s genuflecting knee. Ayram silenced his people’s complaints with a glare, meanwhile Obo simply nodded his thanks and set the skin aside.
“So what will it be, then?” Ayram asked. “What will you take in exchange for hunting a beast?”
“I want my freedom.”
Ayram’s laugh was a bellowing slap—“Hah!”. And when the sound finished ringing around the pit, he said with magnanimous charm, “Kill the Amalgamete, and I’ll let you run into whatever hole you like.”
“No holes,” said Obo. “I wish to be rid of the pseudospark which dwells inside my stomach. I wish to be freed from the Minder’s will which beats my heart. If I had my own bright Spark, then my body and will would be my own. Give this to me, and I would use my fire to kill whoever, or whatever, you wish.”
Ayram’s brow jumped into an incredulous arc. “I’ve been mistaken for a god before, but never Solraheen Himself. You want me to forge a Divine Spark?”
Obo pointed to Mandri. “I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into that boy’s body, so I know it is possible.”
All eyes swiveled to Mandri, who still lay sprawled in the center of the circle. He shrank within his robe against the onslaught of spiteful glares.
“If you could infuse Mandri’s corpse with a Spark, then do the same for me.”
Ayram turned to his scarecrow witch. “Tell the Mazid that it’s impossible.”
Elrahet had been standing perfectly still through all of this, staring at Mandri. Her eyes lingered a pinky finger longer on him, then they flicked away to scour Obo.
“I cleansed the boy’s Spark,” she said gruffly. “I did not breathe him a new one.”
“It can’t be done,” said Ayram firmly.
“I did not say it could not be done,” Elrahet growled as her hand twisted tight on the knobby head of her sand-smoothed cane. To Mandri’s great surprise, she even savored a sneer at her leader. “A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require a sacrifice greater than I can summon. Better to wring the will out of the boy. That, or we find another Minder.”
“Agreed,” said Ayram before turning to Obo and adding, “Even if she could do it, I cannot trust you.” Then he beckoned to his followers and barked, “Moto and Tob! Come hold it flat.”
Big bush Tob stood up. The other man, Moto, was an athletic Zosan. They both hurried over to the kneeling Obo. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand. Tob threw punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. 
“Settle down Tob,” Ayram griped after Tob spat up a chunk of smoke-blacked spit onto Obo’s face. Tob grinned at Ayram’s chiding remark, though he did settle down as Ayram wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar.
This bar was one solid piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head. At its top, the iron splayed out into a chisel, while at the bottom, the iron belled out into a sphere the size of Ayram’s giant fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled the bar once as if it were as light as an oilwood spear.
“If I can’t make you kneel on my own terms,” he said to Obo, “Then you won’t need your legs.”
He marched towards Obo with menace in his step.
“There’s no need for this,” Obo protested, but Ayram was a man who could be moved. He said, “If the Minder can’t mind, then what’s there to stop you from running away when no one’s looking? No. We’ll all be more comfortable this way.”
He raised his spear above Obo’s thigh, and Mandri shut his eyes.
While Mandri could hide from the sight of such a gruesome affair, he could not hide from the sound. When the chisel-head stabbed into Obo’s flesh it snapped the bone.
But Obo did not cry out. Mandri, stunned, sneaked a peek, and there nearby was the Zosan, Moto, steadying Obo’s left hip as he hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons. They repeated this work on Obo’s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.
Through it all, Obo made no sound, and when it was over, and he was legless, Ayram raised his iron bar and shouted, “Someone bag the Mazid up! Bag everything up. It’s time to walk. That damned Amalgamete ain’t coming to us.”
All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled past Mandri and into the darkness of the cave. Forty stopped at Mandri’s side and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked, he glanced back towards Obo, whose blood-stub of a body was a frightful sight laying there in the sand, and just as Mandri’s heart was strafed by the shame of somehow having caused all this, Obo caught his eye, smiled, and gave him another wink, before promptly shutting his eyes for another long spell of pretending to be unconscious.</Text>
            <Notes>PROBLEM: 
Elrahet is trying to get mandri to tell it to kneel, but minders can’t do that.

Passenger of the moment

Problem:
Obo needs to be stopped by mandri. It is mandri’s power which allows for the Mazidfire.

This fucks with the convo where ayram explains to obo his purpose.


Concussive

I didn’t give him a spark, I resusitated it.

Accelerate plans.

            <Title>Communication</Title>
            <Text>When there is a flaw in communication. There are an infinite number of ways to interpret each statement. 

But as what happens in any communication, the first. Perhaps there is a single word of clarification. But mostly there is a shut door, and the assumptions fester.

Requires a thorough investigation of intent. It is exceedingly difficult to know precisely why any given utterance is uttered.

“So why do you keep asking questions?”

Mandri stops talking.
No. Mandri I wont allow this.
Do you want a gag?It’s not fair, Mandri. Speech, all communication, is exceedingly difficult. I need to investigate your thoughts to know that you understand what I said as I intended.

I feel like I can talk to you. I don’t have to worry about my words being taken the wrong way.  </Text>

            <Title>Pain</Title>
            <Text>One religion is True and the rest are False. This categorization satisfies most, but some people aren’t content with a simple dichotomy so they continue to divide the world’s religions through a rigorous analysis of the similarities and differences of belief and behavior.
Solitants come specially prepared for battle in this arena. When they proselytize to the fractured, they open with the observation that every religion in existence turns on a story that explains the origin of suffering. The Supine Cult believes that there are two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter. The Bavainu believe that suffering is a result of one’s own evil acts, or one’s ancestors. The Shell Kings believe that suffering is a symptom of Shellkhashar, which is a kind of spiritual, transmittable disease which dulls virtuous instinct. There are a hundred more religions, each with a hundred variations, and in every instance, the story of suffering’s arrival is accompanied by a solution for it. The Supine Cult entreats their followers to lay down and pray their energy into the sky to make it stronger, for that is where the righteous god dwells. The Bavainu say that if one lives rightly and follows their ancient law, their life will be a happy one. The Shell Kings recommend drinking the blood of a willing virgin mixed with a mind melting toxin found in a sea snail’s shell. Every religion has its own solution to suffering. That’s a category, religions peddling relief—and all religions belong to it, all of them except for Solitantcy.
The Solitants offer no solution to life’s troubles. &quot;We’re the only ones who believe that suffering is not something to fear,&quot; a Solitant priest will say. &quot;Suffering is what this is all about!&quot;
He or she then smiles, and the smile accentuates the self-inflicted scar on their cheek which marks the rite of initiation into Solitant orders. Those Solitants who have delved deep into the mysteries smile underneath a mask of scars.
&quot;Life is suffering&quot;, they say. &quot;Try to suffer without suffering.&quot; They laugh because it doesn’t make sense. Truly, the Divine Spark is like a block of sculptor's stone. It is clean, abstract, inert, featureless—and then comes the sculptor's chisel. As the chisel carves away at the stone to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the person. What troubles our fleshy vessels is what makes us who we are. In this way, Solitants are artists of the Self and their chisel is pain. Solraheen guides the hammer.
Typical Hrkan speech has only the one word for pain. If a person says, “I am in pain,” there’s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe, or did a loved one die? Have their bowels been blocked for days? The word ‘pain’ can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are using the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The words ‘anguish’, ‘ache’, ‘soreness’, ‘irritation’, and ‘misery’ all approach different things, but they’re not nearly enough to cover the spectrum. In casual use they’re ill-defined notions, substitutable, a fuzzy cloud orbiting pain.
The Solitant goes as far as to claim that the very structure of Hrkan speech stunts the growth of pain appreciation, as the mind cannot develop a sensitivity to certain flavors of agony if the world is divided into subject, verb, and object. Such a structure separates the Self from the action, and in so doing, grand vistas of becoming remain hidden from sight.
The keyturn comes after reflecting on the sentence, ‘I hurt myself.’
I
Hurt
Myself.
Notice how language has smuggled in a narrative. It has conjured out of nothing an ‘I’ from before and a ‘myself’ after the act of hurt. It has split the Self in two, which is impossible. It has reduced ‘hurt’ to simple phase transition. Solitants find this framing limiting, and so they invented a tenseless, subjectless language revolving around pain and its effects. Outside looking in, this language is more of a catalog of rasping utterances than a functional language, but Solitants claim it has utility nonetheless.
Mandri was perfectly fine with the phrase ‘I hurt myself’. Hurting himself was the primary means he’d acquired hurt. He suspected that it was the same for everyone else. There was no need to deconstruct something so universal. There definitely wasn’t any point in creating a whole new language to discover the subtleties of pain, because pain was best expressed through the natural language of gesture, as Solraheen intended. In breadth of expression, the face is far, far superior to words. Of what use is a fuzzy word when one can see the pain written on the face clear as day?
Observe the eye and brow of a person in pain—is there languor, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience, anxiety? Is the skin knit tight, is it smooth, is it beaded with sweat? Is the eye’s lid puffy or hollow? Are the cheeks wet or dry, dark or pale, sallowing brown, or purple, or yellow? Then there’s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up into the face. The lower back knots up, the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, and finally the lips draw tight and the teeth gnash. A trained eye can look at another in pain and know, without words, the entirety of their inner world. The holy language of the Solitants is redundant, and no argument could convince Mandri otherwise, that is, until a demon bit his thigh.
Pain woke him from his fainting spell, a pain so intense that the slightest pressure elicited a scream. The skin around the already clotted wound was taut and throbbing, a drumhead reverberating pain. Moto tried to make him walk, but that was impossible, so Moto carried him. Chopper tossed Mandri atop Moto’s pack, and with each step that the man took, Mandri’s raw wound chafed against a shoulder, sending a fresh wave of excruciating pain into his groin and hip.
Mandri fainted again.
He woke up the next day when Moto leaned back and dropped him from a height like a camel dropping dung. Mandri landed hard on his wounded thigh and he let loose a gargled curse. He tried to find some twist of hip and spine that could give relief, and these contortions ended with him lying all the way back and shifting most of his weight onto his right ass cheek. Here, Mandri’s reeling mind found the space to understand that he was still alive.
He could breathe.
He was not dead. 
Damn it all.
Through the chewed-up hole in his robe he could see that his affected left thigh had been poulticed and bandaged, though it was poorly done, even by his severed-hand standards. The brown woolen wraps were ragged and splitting apart. A few sturdy threads were all that was holding the mass of spongy, mud-dusted weeds together. 
He looked up and saw that the reason Moto dropped him was because they’d arrived at some accursed destination—an enormous black rock sitting in the middle of a flat and barren sandy landscape.
Mandri was astonished by the sight of it. It wasn’t just any big rock, it was a single, smooth, uncracked rock. Rocks that big in the Sand tend to look like old, slumping things that have been half-melted by the sun, but this rock, this biggest of all boulders, was a healthy, upright egg. So unnatural and precarious was its position that it seemed a strong blast of wind should be able to pick the whole thing up and send it rolling along the desert floor. Mandri felt that if he stood next to it and gave a hearty push, he could get it rolling. 
Sitting as it was in an empty desert landscape, with no other rocky eminence in sight, well, that made it seem like the rock had been deliberately placed there by the hand of Solraheen. Surely, it was a holy site.
Moto was stooped over a big pile of the Ayramun’s haulings some yards away. There were only two other Ayramun present, two dour looking men who milled about that pack heap. Moto unstrapped his own pack and tossed it on top of the others.
“What are you two doing?” he demanded of the two.
“We been looking for you,” said one of them, a Zosan whose only distinguishing feature was a polished brass hoop wrapped tight around his neck.
“Looks to me like you've been doing nothing,” Moto replied. 
“We got told to look for you, and here we are, lookin right at you.”
Moto nodded towards Mandri and said, “Well, now you can look at him. Make sure he doesn’t go and do something stupid.”
“How about we take you to Ayram, as we been ordered to do?”
Moto looked back at Mandri, who wasn’t going anywhere. He then shrugged and said, “Lead on.”
The three men walked off towards the giant black rock. They walked around it, and then disappeared.
Mandri wasn’t concerned about being left behind. He was busy twisting himself around to try and undo the searing knot of pain that throbbed inside his thigh and hip. He did finally find some meager relief by sticking his hand under his right ass cheek and leaning on it.
He decided that he well and truly hated Moto. This was more than the flippant hate he doled out to everyone and no one in particular. He tried to recall the words to an Old Jandri curse that could kill a callous man like Moto, but the pain in his leg was a powerful amnestic.
He set about preparing the ground around him so that he could more comfortably wallow in it. Eventually, he decided to shimmy over to the pile of packs so that he could use it as a prop, and as soon as he did, something on the other side of the pile groaned.
Mandri dragged himself closer to get a better look. He was careful not to disrupt the tenuous peace he’d negotiated between himself and the wound in his thigh. As soon as the pain flared up he stopped moving altogether. He nestled up against the pile and settled his elbow into a bag of grain. He let his hip sink gently into an inside-out goat bladder stuffed with who knows what. 
The groan he’d heard came from a lump of dusty black rags that sat a few yards away from the pile. They were Mazidobo’s rags, and the lump they covered was the right size for a legless Mazid.
Mandri felt around for something to poke Obo with. His searching fingers settled on an empty waterskin. He threw it at Obo, and the limp waterskin flapped harmlessly into the sand.
“I know you’re there,” Mandri said.
He waited, but no response came.
Mandri dug around in the pile for something else to throw. He was so tickled by all the little outland trinkets, stone beads and thumbstick idols of gods he didn’t know, that he almost didn’t register the dull, snapping crack of bone as Obo’s black rags twitched then went silent.
“You okay?” he asked the rags, but again, there was no answer.
Mandri pulled a tight ball of twine out of the pile. He tossed it underhand, and when it landed on that pile of rags they sighed. Another crack of bone sounded out, and the rags twitched again, but this time Obo’s jerking loosed a strap of robe to reveal his pale shoulder. Mandri watched, half in terror, half in curiosity as Obo’s pale and hairless head emerged from that mass of tattered robes.
“Hello, Mandri.”
Obo suddenly sat up, and his robes fell away to reveal a scrawny, bruised, and broken body. Mandri had seen awful sights, but watching this pale Mazid fix a dislocated rib was something else entirely. And judging by the sorry state of his robes, and the bloody abrasions splotching his shoulders, he hadn’t been carried through the desert like Mandri, he’d been dragged along its floor. 
Despite all the abuse, Obo’s mood was ordinary. He stretched his arms and what was left of his legs as if he were a cat waking up from a nap. He even twisted around to draw out the kinks of his spine, and this stretch popped every one of his vertebrae in rapid succession, causing Mandri’s own spine to stiffen in sympathetic fright, a sudden jerk that unleashed a fresh wave of torture radiating out of his thigh.
He yelped.
Obo smiled like a beerbat.
“What are you smiling at?” Mandri asked.
“I’m happy to have some company that doesn’t want to ruin me.”
Obo took up his robes in his mouth and scooted himself closer to the pile of the Ayramun’s packs, and as he leaned himself up against them, he caught Mandri staring at his stumped legs, which had been stuck into canvas sacks.
Obo spat out his robe and covered himself up as if it were a blanket.
“You should save that anxious look for yourself,” he said. “I smell death on you.”
Mandri looked down at his missing hand and his poorly poulticed leg. “I think I made it through the worst of it.”
“Doesn’t look that way to me.”
“Last night I could hardly breathe, but now I can breathe just fine.”
“What happened?”
“You wouldn’t believe me.”
“I might.”
“I was bit by a demon.”
“A demon?”
“I said you wouldn’t believe me.”
“Are you sure it wasn’t some strange species of lizard?”
“I’m sure. It was a demon.”
“When you first saw me, you thought I was a demon.”
“This was different.”
“As may be, but I think it’s worth appreciating that there is always a distinction between what you see, and your interpretation of what you see.”
Mandri winced hard as the pain in his leg reared.
“You should let me look at the wound,” said Obo.
“Why?”
“I may be able to do something for the pain. I won’t know for sure unless I see it first.”
Despite Obo’s calm and generally amicable demeanor, there was no getting past the fact that Obo looked like a creature who wriggled around in caves. The absence of eyebrows, those signposts of the Spark, made it impossible to ascertain the intentions hidden behind his shine-silver eyes. 
But the pain in Mandri’s leg was stupid, and Mandri couldn’t think of many things worse than something stupid that refuses to go away, so he huffed and puffed and rolled himself over to where Obo sat. Once he made himself as comfortable as he could be, he scrunched up the hem of his robe to reveal the bite, and that’s when fear took hold of him.
The many veins in his inner thigh ran black as ink, and nearer to the loose poultice above his knee, those black veins were bulging above his skin like nightworms.
“Sol’s light,” Mandri muttered.
He gingerly unwrapped the long strip of wool that held the poultice in place. The various weedy leaves and lichens that composed the meat were too dried out to be doing any good, and he was able to flick most of it into his open palm easily enough, but the rest he had to pluck, for the pulped leaf stems closer to the flesh were caked in a gooey dark-brown emulsion of infected blood and poultice paste.
“Try to clean it up,” said Obo.
“What do you think I’m doing?”
Mandri kept picking until all that was left was the terrifying sight of a day-old demon bite. The edges of this fang-scalloped wound were festering and black, and this jagged ring of necrotic flesh enclosed a puddle of that brown emulsion, which had, in parts, been scraped away to reveal the red-raw muscle of his thigh.
Opening the wound to the air reinvigorated the pain. Still, it looked worse than it felt. What really got Mandri worried was how his inky black veins spidered up his thigh and in towards his crotch.
“Let’s see the full extent of it”, Obo said as he leaned over the affected area.
“No. I don’t want to know what my uglies look like.”
“How does your chest feel?
“Just hurry up and do what you’re gonna do.”
Obo studied the wound with an impassive gaze, eyes darting from detail to detail, as if he were a dealer appraising a painting, and the particular texture and color of the budding scab could help him determine authenticity.
“Hurry up,” said Mandri.
Obo pulled back and said flatly, “I can’t do anything for you.”
“What?”
“That is the strangest bite wound I’ve ever seen. I’m half inclined to believe your story.”
“You said you could help with the pain.”
“Did I?”
“Don’t tell me you lied.”
“A Mazid never lies.”
“Bullshit, I bet you lie all the time.” Mandri slapped the weedy poultice back onto his wound, and he did his best to re-roll that ragged strip of wool around it.
“Do you know what this place is?” Mandri asked, nodding towards the giant black rock.
“I overheard one of our captors call it Minting Rock.”
“Wonder why it’s called that.”
“The name suggests it’s a place for these bandits to mint counterfeit coins away from prying eyes. But I’ve seen such places before, and this one is different.”
“How so?”
“Most illegal mints are hidden near a natural spring. There is no spring here, so far as I can tell. And this rock, it’s too conspicuous to be a mere bandit’s den. It possesses a numinous beauty.”
“If it were blacker, I’d call it a boulder of Fabled Black.” Mandri dabbed his finger against the black veins running up his thigh. That was a mistake, for the pain it kicked up was severe.
Obo ignored his wincing and said, “I would say it’s a holy site, but these Ayramun are too crude for it.”
“Especially Moto,” Mandri hissed between breaths of pain. “The man is an ass. The man is a donkey wearing human skin.”
“My admittedly limited impression of him was that he was one of the smarter ones.”
Mandri sighed and tried to distract himself by stealing a small bag of spicy jerked beef from the mound of things. He popped one of these slips of meat into his mouth, and he tucked it into his cheek to let its flavors fix him.
“Moto’s not smart,” he said. “Speaks well enough, but that doesn’t mean anything. He’s as dumb as the rest of them.”
“They’re not so bad.”
“You’re wrong. They’re cruel. Look at what they’ve done to you.”
“I don’t know,” said Obo, wiggling his stumps under his rags. “I think that Ayram was right to do what he did, from his point of view.”
Mandri was waiting for a sarcastic wink but it never came.
“He chopped off your legs,” Mandri said bitterly.
“And I’m thankful he showed such restraint.”
Still no wink.
Mandri chewed the jerky because he would scream from the pain in his leg if he didn’t. “You’ll never be able to walk again,” he said.
“Should I be angry about that?”
“Yes! You should! I’m angry for you. I tell you what, I’ll hate the Ayramun for the both of us. They deserve it for what they’ve done to me—and you.”
“I thought a demon did that to you.”
“If that ass Moto didn’t tie me up and throw me into a lizard pit, I never would have been bit. He’s half-demon himself.”
“It could be worse. If you’d been caught up by Kalemites, you’d have been eaten, and the one to consume your stomach would today be wearing your sacrum strapped onto his forehead.”
“I would have preferred that,” Mandri said with a wry grin.
“Maybe,” said Obo, dryly. “But the pain will pass, one way or another.”
Mandri disagreed, but kept it to himself. He stole another slip of beef and tucked the rest back where he’d found it. He set the beef on top of his tongue, and he savored the unfamiliar blend of spices. Some strange pepper in it, and a heap of salt. He was getting thirsty now. He’d like some water.
“Mandri, why don’t you hate me?”
The question caught Mandri off-guard and he nearly swallowed his slip.
“What?”
“Every Minder I’ve ever had has hated me.”
“Who says I don’t?”
“I do.”
“Well you’re wrong about that too.”
“You can’t lie to me about this, because I literally feel your moods.”
Mandri licked his fingers. “Well if you really want, I could hate you a little bit.”
“No, I was hoping we could be friends.”
Mandri laughed, but Obo’s face was serious.
“Friends?”
“Yes.”
“Well,” said Mandri, “A little hatred won’t get in the way of a good friendship. Friendship doesn’t actually require us to like each other.”
“I was under the impression that it did.”
“Wrong again.”
“I thought the purpose of friendship was to make life less miserable.”
“That’s one way of putting it,” Mandri said as reoriented his hip to soothe a pang of pain in his thigh. “Put another way, friendship is something people do to pass the time. We don’t actually need to like each other to do that.”
“I see,” said Obo, disappointed. “I would disagree, but I can’t challenge your own experiences with my own as I have none to share.”
That was such a sad way of stating loneliness, that Mandri actually felt a little bad for the Mazid. “The Hrks treat you like a slave, don’t they?”
“I’d say we Mazydai are treated worse than slaves.”
“Well, believe me, friendship—true friendship like you’re thinking of—it doesn’t exist. Like if it’s too much trouble for me to help you out, I won’t. Don’t look so glum, it goes both ways. We can call it something else. Acquaintances is a word we could use.”
“You didn’t answer my original question.”
“Oh. What was it?”
“Why don’t you hate me?”
“Obo, I never made a conscious decision about it. Maybe I do hate you. I don’t know. I will eventually. Two people get to know each other well enough, and they start to hate each other—I’ve seen it play out a thousand times.”
“If you think that I’m a person that you can get to know, then you’re already the nicest person I’ve ever met.”
“Please, Obo, you’re laying it on way too thick.”
Obo tried to look confused, but without eyebrows he just looked constipated. “What does that mean, ‘laying it on thick’?”
“You might be able to fool these outland pokes, but I’m a different breed.”
“I still don’t know what you mean.”
“Let’s see—you obviously don’t feel pain. You don’t seem to feel anger, and I very much doubt you feel compassion. You said you want your freedom, and you had your legs chopped off to stop you from ever trying to run away. I’m not dumb, Obo, you’re not talking to me right now because you want a friend. What you want is a pair of legs to help you run away. You can’t exactly go running off into the Sand, but I can. And I’m your Minder—who better for it?”
“You can run on that leg?”
“Well, no. But I’m not wrong.”
“You must be the most skeptical creature that ever breathed a thought.”
“Am I wrong?”
“You are. I do feel compassion. You only suspect I don’t because I can guard my emotions. I can choose whether or not to express them.”
“If you were capable of compassion, I wouldn’t have seen a Mazid kill a hundred-score in a heartbeat.”
“When?”
“The massacre of Gudrk.”
“Gudrk was two hundred years ago.”
“I saw it in a painting.”
“Of course,” said Obo, scoffing.
“But am I wrong? You say you never lie, so answer me that—am I wrong?”
“Wrong about what?”
“That the only reason you’re talking to me is because you want to use me for whatever escape you’re scheming up.”
Obo paused to consider his words carefully.
“It’s a simple yes or no,” Mandri nudged.
Obo tilted his head back and forth as if to weigh some heavy decision. He finally muttered, “How should I say this...”
“By saying yes, or no.”
“I am talking to you because I wish to explore the potential of our relationship.”
“Uh-huh.”
“I have no plans.”
“Now that is a lie.”
“I have no plans yet,” said Obo with a mischievous grin. “First I have to discover what that giant wants with me.”
“Isn’t it obvious?”
“It is not.”
“He said he wants you to kill a great demon.”
“I very much doubt there is some unheard of demon king hiding out in the Sand. If there is, and a Mazid could kill it, then Hrk could deal with the problem as easily as Ayram. The Lords hatch a new Mazid every other year. Ayram’s quest, as stated, is unnecessary.”
“So then what does he want, then?”
“The obvious answer is that he wants what every other outland man and woman wants, and that’s to destroy the Hrkan world.”
“That doesn’t seem possible.”
“It isn’t.”
“And why involve me? Why didn’t Ayram make himself Minder?”
“I suspect he didn’t want to lose his hand. I also suspect he wants to outlive the year. Minders don’t live very long once they’re bonded.”
“Wait, what?”
“You didn’t know? ”
“Know what?”
“Once bonded to a Mazid, a Minder’s life can be measured in—”
Suddenly, Obo’s attention shifted towards Minting Rock. Mandri followed his alarmed gaze, and saw nothing, only the rock itself. But Obo could hear things, and perhaps see things that nobody else could. Mandri tried to discern if the news was good or bad by studying Obo’s face as the Mazid strained his preternatural senses, but his eye barely twitched. Obo gave nothing away unless he wanted to. 
“The stage is set,” Obo finally said. “We will have to hold this discussion.”
Obo stuffed the hem of his tattered robe into his mouth and stump-shuffled back to the spot where he lay before. He plopped down flat and covered himself back up with his black tatters so that it looked like he’d never moved at all.
He gave Mandi one last whisper, and the breath of his voice fluffed the folds covering his mouth. “Pretend that we never spoke.”
“Yeah, I gathered that.”
Then there came a loud, finger-mouth whistle from the direction of Minting Rock, bright as a bright-beak’s call. A heartbeat later, and people began to tumble out from around Minting Rock’s belly. First one, then three, then seven of them, and last came Ayram. Each in turn took off jogging towards Mandri and the pile of dumped goods. They looked like they were fleeing before a marauding giant.
The first to reach him was the short, boorish man named Hill. Hill pushed Mandri over, casually ignoring Mandri’s agonized hoot. He picked up the pack that Mandri had been laying against, and he gave Mandri the most disapproving look as he trotted back towards Minting Rock. The rest did much the same. Ayram was the only one to stay. He stood right over Mandri and his great big head and round loaf beard blotted out the sun.
Such was the man’s size that Mandri felt humbled, and humbling Mandri was no easy feat. No matter how intelligent or beautiful someone seemed, it could never erase the fact that they were only human—impulsive and excitable. Self-interested. Mandri, buried in Ayram’s shadow, looked up and saw all the familiar features of a man but did not match the pattern as a person. Ayram was greater, somehow more solid, a reference point for being, like an old tree or a father in the eyes of a son.
“Moto!” Ayram shouted. “Get over here!”
Moto was one of the Ayramun who’d been scrambling around, hauling all those packs towards Minting Rock. He was hugging a bulging sack of sand-dried vegetables when he heard Ayram shout his name. He immediately dropped the sack and jogged over to see what the fuss was about.
Mandri was pleased to see that his thigh had left a swipe-stain of his own blood on the shoulder of Moto’s otherwise speckless garb. A small victory, but a victory.
“Explain,” Ayram said as he pointed to Mandri’s leg.
“It’s as I said. The boy got bit by a demon.”
“In the thigh?”
“He was trying to run away from me and he jumped into a lizard pit.”
“No I didn’t,” Mandri countered, his own voice sounding whiny even to him.
“Explain why this boy was running away from you.”
Moto shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as if he hadn’t the faintest idea. Ayram glared at the man, clearly expecting an answer, so Moto cooked up some bullshit about Mandri trying to escape. His whole body got involved as he told his false story. Mandri was familiar with the technique. All that gesticulating, it wasn’t really about selling the lie, it was about Moto letting Ayram know that he was going to cause a fuss if he was called out on the lie, and if Ayram thought that fuss would be more trouble then the whole thing was worth, Moto might just get away with it. 
Moto finished by extending his arms all the way out to the sky and declared, “The boy’s an idiot! He doesn’t think. He’s got a dull Spark. You should have seen it, the demon was chewing on his leg and he didn’t even try to fight the thing off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.”
Mandri knew he couldn’t speak out of turn so he was forced to resort to an incredulous gasp, and with each word that Moto spoke, Mandrameen’s face scrunched up tighter and tighter—he made every effort short of squealing to let Ayram know that Moto was lying.
“You didn’t do what I told you to do,” Ayram finally said. 
“How could I?” Moto griped. “It’d take twelve virgins to liven this one up! The boy has no will to live.”
“Take the Mazid,” Ayram growled.
Moto walked slowly and deliberately to where Obo lay, picked him up, tucked him under the arm, and then took off towards Minting Rock, sending back a threatening glare for Mandri before he left.
 Ayram tapped out his frustration against his elbows as he stared at Mandri’s leg.
“It was an ill omen, finding you dead in the hills. It took my witch a whole hand to convince me that your Spark was worth rekindling. When a man is brought back from the dead, sometimes, he comes back changed, corrupted…agents of Shis. Is that what you are?”
The mention of Shis triggered in Mandri the memory of Salavan’s hidden basement. He tried to block all thoughts of that black painting out of his mind because he felt that Ayram’s wild eyes were reading his thoughts.
“Can you walk?”
“I can try.”
Mandri rolled onto his stomach and pushed himself up onto his good knee, and from there, he stood up. His bad leg was as stiff as a board, though he was determined to walk on his own for he knew it would not go well for him if he couldn’t carry his own weight.
He took a step and shuddered.
“I don’t think I can walk, but I might be able to hobble.”
Ayram nodded. “Make your way into the rock.” He reached down and grabbed Mandri’s left arm, and his gigantic fingers encircled the bicep a whole half over. 
“It is good that you try to walk. An evil man would make himself a burden.”
With Mandri steadied, Ayram let go,  and moved to retrieve the last items from the Ayramun’s pile. Then set off stomping back towards Minting Rock, leaving Mandri and the desert to themselves.
Mandri hopped a few steps, but his left leg still couldn’t bear even the slightest weight. It felt like his thigh bone had splintered, and every shuffling hop sent white shards of bone stabbing into the meat of his thigh.
But it was not a great distance, so he soldiered on.
As he went he thought of the Solitants and their sacred tortures. He wondered if they had a word for the particular arc of sensations that a demon bite inflicts. He wondered what this pain would do to him, what kind of man it would make him if he toughed it out.
He looked out over the empty Sand and recalled a heretical painting titled, ‘Oneness with the Divine’. It depicted a flayed Solitant lying on a rack, his skin completely unwrapped from his body, his bare anatomy exposed to the haze of incense floating around a dark room. This mortification was a ritual performed by only the most schismatic of adherents, men and women who did not want to craft the Self, but tried instead to destroy it. This particular ritual was an attempt to confront the Self with the truth that there was no edge between it and the rest of reality. The logic was as crude as the operation—removing the skin removes the Self’s final boundary. There is nothing left to contain it.
But no doubt the ecstasy depicted in that Solitant's face was put there by the artist. It was not possible that a person could remain conscious through such an ordeal. And Mandri refused to accept that a ritual flensing could lead a person to righteousness. What kind of world would he be living in if that were true? Such a place could only be called Shis.
He made it into the shadow of Minting Rock and pressed his hand against the rock’s cold belly. He pushed as hard as he could. He didn’t expect to be able to push it over, but he had to satisfy his curiosity. It really did seem that if he stood there long enough, a strong wind would blow and the rock would roll over and squish him like a bug. 
Cut into the earth at the base of the rock a hole that looked far too much like a giant drag-belly den. As there was no other way but down, he hitched on. This dark and cramped tunnel soon led him into a dead end of undressed stone stacked haphazardly like an old goatherd's fence. Above him, high up, was a circle of daylight. It seemed as if he were at the bottom of a dried-up well that had been carved all the way through the core of Minting Rock itself.
From above, a voice shouted, “Grab the rope!”
Mandri fumbled about in the darkness and his hand stumbled upon a rope. He took several deep breaths to battle the pain, then he held on tight as he was hauled up into the stomach of Minting Rock.</Text>

            <Text>Mandri hated terror. There’s nothing complicated about it. He was well familiar with its tired routine—first it startled him into stupidity, and then it spurred him into action, or reigned him in, according to the flavor of the moment. He knew it was coming and he knew what it would do and yet here it was and there was no fighting it. When that roaring beam of Mazydfire lit up the night, he became terrified, and the next thing he knew, he was running through an accursed temple’s bowels, bumping his nose and toes on stone shelves and cabinet footings because he wasn’t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn’t allowed, according to Moto, because that there wasn’t any time to light one up, even though it only took five half-halves of a god-damned finger. As it goes with terror—reason is not allowed to a say. If it was, he might have been able to reason out why, in response to threat of a hunting Mazyd, the best course of action was to flee deeper into a demon haunted world.
He hated these Ayramun for leading him here. He loved these Ayramun for protecting him from the dark. He hated them and loved them in equal turns. Moto led them into a dark dead end, and Mandri hated him. Moto led them into a windowed hall flush with fresh night air, and Mandri loved him. Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated him. Mandri slipped on spot of Seb’s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated him—Seb was the sole exception to this confusing succession of states in which blurred together and hinted at a deeper reality which Mandri could not articulate. Love and hate, it seemed, were only crude approximations—it was as if there was a color portrait to be painted here, but all Mandri had were pigments black and white.
It reminded him, and this was not the time for it, but it reminded him of Solraheen, for Solraheen was both comforting and terrifying—Mandri feared a loving Divine. There were emotions at play that he was not at all equipped to understand. 
He hated Elrahet for her witchy mumblings as she scampered along in the dark.
“This isn’t right. This isn’t right. This isn’t right.”
He loved her because she seemed to be the only one who knew what was going on.
“This way!” she barked when Moto ran passed a doorway.
Purl yanked Mandri’s arm.
“Put your sword away you idiot!”
He didn’t even know he had it out.
“You’re going to stab me,” she said.
“I won’t.”
“I feel safer with it out.”
“Damn you Moto!” Purl cursed.
“What did I do?”
“You gave this idiot a sword!”
Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade. Good thing he did, because not long after, Moto took a sharp turn into another dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. 
“What are we doing?” Moteah asked with venom. Moto, the prime object of her ire, turned towards the dark and said, “I think we should wait here for Ayram.”
“Don’t act like you meant to run in here.”
Seb, who was bringing up the rear, said, “There’s no point in waitin’ up for Ayram. He’s dead.”
Moto dismissed Seb’s dour pronouncement with a sneer. “Ayram’s not dead.”
“Is too,” said Seb. “Saw him swallowed by Mazydfire.”
“He fell down a canyon before the flame even touched him.”
“That’s not what I saw,” said Seb.
“Seb, you can’t see shit.”
“Ayram fell down a canyon?” Moteah asked.
Moto said, “He jumped into it. To dodge the flame.”
And so commenced an argument, and Mandri began to hate them all. As the insults and half- charges flew, Mandri retreated into a dark corner of this small room. He wished it wouldn’t have been so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. No temple he’d ever been in was so black—and it wasn’t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps because there weren’t any light fittings bolted to the walls. He looked up and noticed that the flat ceiling was completely free from the soot of ages, and in this place there was no hope of natural light—Shulgi was much too thick in the belly for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help you lose yourself, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.
There was art all along the walls for Mandri to distract himself with. Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around this apparent dead end, and they were stacked upon the each other from floor to the ceiling. The walls all throughout the place were carved up like this, and most were painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with lines and lines of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears, there were garden scenes where Old Jandri kings strolled along in quiet contemplation, there were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of martyrs screaming Solraheen’s name as tongues of flame licked their ribs.
Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that was being told. It reminded him of Hrkan tomb art—some rich prick decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when the tomb’s door is sealed, no one is allowed to have a look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and now no one is looking. A monumental waste of good pigment.
No places for candles in a tomb.
No room for natural light either.
Maybe this place’s purpose was to be a tomb.
If it were true, maybe it’d be written here on the wall. Unfortunately, Mandri wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at in terms of narrative. He wasn’t even sure if he were reading the panels in the right direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether?
He looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight. It was hard to see, because not only was the light too dim, but it blinked every time Moto waved his frantic arms to try and express his argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene—the moment of Solraheen’s apotheosis, when He emerged out of void. It was represented here by a blank face emerging from a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark ripping out the stone. Each claw was as wide as two fingers.
“Uh, guys.”
The others were too engrossed in their squabble to hear him. Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.
Mandri raised his voice.
“Hey!”
They all stopped bickering.
“Look at this,” he said, and he pointed up at the beastly gash in Solraheen’s forehead. 
Seb stepped over, studied the defacement, and shrugged. “It’s just some scratches,” he said.
Elrahet waddled over and held her torch high. She stood on her tiptoes to get her eye close to the claw mark. Mandri thought he saw her sniff.
When she balanced back down on her heels her face was gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.
“It is as I feared,” she said.
“What does that mean?” said Purl.
“It means we need to leave.” 
Then the old witch twirled, black robes fluttering, and trotted off into the darkness, expecting everyone else to follow. 
Moto pushed past Mandri to confront Elrahet.
“What about Ayram?”, he asked.
“Ayram can handle himself,” she said, shrugging him off.
“But you don’t even know where you’re going!”
“We make for the backdoor.”
“But you said you don’t remember—”
“It doesn’t matter!” Elrahet declared, and she whacked her conclusion into Moto’s leg with her staff. “The faster we are out of here, the better, and that won’t happen if we’re standing still!”
Their journey through the dark began anew with Elrahet leading the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the smudges in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because she had a vague memory that Shulgi’s backdoor was, in her words, “down and then out.”
They ventured so far down into this temple mountain that it seemed to Mandri this temple was upside down. A temple’s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens, and there should be an ascension to the roof where the penitent could await the coming dawn. But they went down, and the further down they went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. 
Elrahet led them down a wide fan of stairs whose ceiling bowed up into a black void. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts were closing in on them. And after the ceiling, the walls disappeared. Suffice to say, Mandri no longer felt like he was ‘inside’.  The Ayramun were a splotch of light in a sea of darkness. If not for the hard stone under his feet and the faux-brick pattern on it, he would have supposed that they had wandered straight into the depths of Shis.
“I remember now,” said Elrahet.
She practically sprinted past two enormous spiraled columns. These columns were easily four times the size of those in Shulgi’s entrance hall, and they straddled a long tongue of obsidian-studded floor which marked a processional way. The Ayramun hurried past these columns, and ahead was another pair, then another, and another, when finally, they came upon an incredible natural sandstone throne set atop a plinth of granite. Its seat was smooth and featureless, as if carved by a river, and its back was a petrified spire of flame licked into a curl by an unseen of wind.
 Elrahet stopped before it, took a moment catch her breath, then said, “There’s a hall behind.”
She scuttled around the throne, and the Ayramun followed. There behind the throne was a perfectly square doorway cut into the thick wall. They all filtered through, and they hadn’t gotten ten steps into its hall, when Elrahet stopped again. 
Something on the ground had caught her attention.
She set her torch low to the floor.
There, splattered across the stone was a dried splotch of blood. She bent down to touch it, and as she did, a voice rose out of the dark, a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed it was the voice of the mountain itself. 
“What do you make of it, whitch?”
The echo rattled Mandri’s bones, and then came another bout of stupefying terror, for an unaccounted-for voice weighs heavy on the scale of terror, heavier still if it comes spewing out a dark abyss, heavier still if it wheezes and warbles as if issuing forth from the throat of a tortured horse. 
Moto sent his torch spinning in this voice’s direction—straight down the hall. The torch clattered along the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop before a fold of skin.
In its upshot light was a beast for which terror was a pure emotion. It was so large, fat, and bloated, that no of it’s form could be seen. It seemed nothing but a giant blob of bleeding pustules and skin. Mandri knew there there must be a mouth in there somewhere, for its rasping voice echoed out again. 
“Let them shee my gloooory.”
Two enormous braziers erupted in flame to reveal an unmistakably human bag of bloat clogging up the hall, mounding up all the way to the ceiling where, sticking out of the top like a cork was the upper torso of a skinny, white-bearded man shawled in a tattered green robe. On his head was a crown.
Scurrying around in front of this overgrown freak were demon roaches the size of dogs, at least ten of them, with oily-black shells and human hands on the ends of their spike-studded legs. Their faces were an unholy mix between a insect’s and a man’s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling, their mouths gulping air like a fish out of water.
Mandri turned to run, but there was no where to go for climbing on the wall behind were four more of those demon beetles. 
“Hag beetles,” said Elrahet. “The spines inside their shells can kill, and their shells are hard as rock.”
A rumbling laugh boomed out from the fleshy king’s stomach. “Keep your namesh to yourshelf, whitch.”
Elrahet turned to face the bloated lord. “Most putrid king,” she said, “none of us are worthy of a names, and yet a name, the good lord gives.”
The creature smiled. His teeth were black and his spit was tar. The beetle-demons clicked and clacked their, vibrating with their master’s mood.
“A name?” the foul lord mused. “A NAME!? Hhhhaaaaaahhhhh!” The laugh sent a shudder through his whole bloated body. “Poison yourselves with your names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. I and mine are more than a name can bear! LOOK at me!”
He spread his tiny arms against his girth.
Elrahet spat and said, “You have perverted your flesh, Greskal.” She pronounced his name with a scornful leer.
The creature laughed again, burping and as it did.
“Ugh-urp-ahuhhheheh… Greshkal!?… Hah!”
He leaned his bulk forwards to resettle his great stomach after the burp had disturbed it. Mandri suspected that somewhere under the ruddy and calloused flabs of skin on the floor were legs, but he doubted this demon king could do much more than lean.
“I am no longer Greshkal,” the bloated wretch said. “I have become…I have become becoming itshelf! Name me, whitch—I am Amalgamete!”
The echo of his great voice filled the hall and stunned all gathered into silence, all save the hag bettles, who chattered and clicked their teeth.
“Do you think me ugly?” Greskal said. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have split and ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from tar, living tar, for in the dim light it seemed that the lump of flesh in his grip was wriggling like a squealing piglet. He let this piglet slip, and the flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.
“This flesh is the world,” said Greskal as he caressed the welling redness. “Don’t you shee? This is the shtuff of the world into which a Spark thrown. The whiter the light of the Spark, the more this filth gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would shupplicate yourshelves before me as your god.”
Elrahet looked down her nose at Greskal and said, “Your son had a stronger stomach than you. Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.”
A paroxysmal twitch shuddered through Greskal’s body. He pointed to Elrahet and shouted, “Silence that ensnaring womb!”
A black spike shot out of a hag beetle’s body and flew at Elrahet. Moto’s sword lashed out with blinding speed and sent the spike bouncing harmlessly aside. 
Greskal grunted his annoyance. Then he said, with a disapproving stare, “You should offer yourshelves willingly. Be joined together inside my shtomach and taste union for once in your miserable livesh.”
“Oh?” said Elrahet. “You don’t want us to fight back? Does stressed meat taste fouler? Poor thing.”
Greskal grimaced. Tar pooled in his bottom lip. With the natural grace of a man made king from birth, he twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, and waved his minions onward.
“Defense first, keep them off,” Moto said to his sister. “I’ll make the killing blows.”
“I’m going to do what I need to do,” Moteah said as she threw down her pack and drew her sword.
Seb was sweating, staring at the doorway behind them that led to throne room.  There the beetle-demons were now creeping down the wall.
Purl tried to slap the terror out of his cheek.
“Wake up!”
Seb looked Purl in the eye, and said, “You insane!? We don’t have a chance!”
Purl slapped him again.
“Seb! Get hold of yourself!”
Seb spat at her feet. He took off running towards the throne room door.
It was only a ten steps distance. 
Seb made it five.
A hag bettle jumped off the wall, straight towards him. As it flew, its shell parted open, and a blur shot out of it’s back. 
Seb’s body went limp. A black spike was stuck right through his chest, through his pack, and even further—through the Riga’s swaddled head.
Mandri wanted to scream in horror, but no sound came out of his lungs. Seb fell to his knees, and then to the floor, gargling on blood and borcandi juice as he went. His killer, still clinging to him like a leech, retracted its spike back into its shell with a horrifying schlick.
Mandri pulled his sword and held it out as Moto had taught him. His arm trembled. Moto’s lessons didn’t prepare him to deal with an eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis. And there were four of them arrayed in front of him like a pack of a dogs.
“What do I do!?” he screamed at Purl.
“Just stab the damned things!”
The next thought that went through Mandri’s head was that things seem to jump faster when they’re jumping at you.
He shrieked, closed his eyes, and swung out.
He felt his blade hit the beetle’s shell.
There was a squelching crunch.
He was still alive.
The beetle demon was dead at his feet. Its back was absolutely crushed. It’s murderous spike twitched feebly on the floor, and somehow Mandri’s sword was completely bloodless.
The other three beetle-demons took to the walls and scurried hurriedly back across the hall towards Greskal, for Ayram standing in the shadow of the throne room doorway. His spear’s chisel tip was dripping black with beetle-demon blood.
“Oh,” Mandri muttered. “Thank god.”
Ayram’s face, his beard, and his shoulders were plastered in sand.
Elrahet asked, “What’s wrong?”
“Arm’s useless.”
His left arm was tucked into his robe.
“So that’s Greskal?” he asked.
“It is.”
Ayram sighed and gritted his teeth. “We don’t have time for this.”
He hoisted his spear up on his shoulder and walked towards the putrid king.
Greskal smiled at the sight. “I’ve been exshpecting you,” he said. “I have a gift eshpecially for you.”
“Not interested,” Ayram growled.
“Give me a moment. A moment, and you’ll have it.”
Greskal rolled his eyes into white and he gave his head a good shake. This seemed to knock loose some internal blockage, and his shoulders shook as his spine twinged and quivered. Then a wave rolled under his great bulk like the ocean rolling under a seaweed shore. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder. Then Greskal screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered. The wailing of his voice was run ragged by all the souls o those he had consumed.
He leaned back and another wave rippled his stomach. A boil burst open, and in its place was a cavity. Blackness oozed out of it, and when the inevitable shudder came this hole ripped wider. A taloned hand burst forth, and out of the Amalgamete’s stomach poured a great demon slathered in tar.
Half man, it stood up on two legs. Half lizard, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It was bigger than Ayram by a head and had the muscles of a prize-winning ox. Its eyes were blood red, double lidded, and its pupils were embered orange. It licked the air with a forked tongue, caught Ayram’s scent, and hissed. Then it stretched out its limbs for the first time, its arms were ribbons of muscle, it’s back a whip, it’s jaw full of hateful fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself, the coursing power, it curled it’s and seemed to know what it was meant to do—if it didn’t, all it need do to learn was to read the fear on Mandri’s face.
It growled, and the vibration sent the hag-beetles clicking and scratching their spikes against the insides their shells. They turned their dumb, lidless eyes towards the Ayramun.
“Go on, my children,” Greskal wheezed. He winced against another violent spasm that shook his whole body. Then he fainted, and the hag beetles began again to crawl.
“Get back!” Ayram shouted. “Against a wall!” He twirled his spear under his good right arm and spat a challenge towards the reptile freak. A snarl of fangs was the answer, and the demon took a step towards his prey—only one step.
The beetles, still clicking their excitement, scurried wide around both giants while Moto and Moteah herded Mandri, Elrahet, and Purl back into a corner. The hag beetles closed ranks behind Ayram, though they weren’t at all that interested in him. They kept on creeping along the hall, while some had ascended up into the darkness of the ceiling. Mandri could just make out the dull shine of their eyes as they took up positions directly above him.
Ayram took a step backwards.
Then another step.
He and the black demon lizard were at least twenty yards apart, but for the speed between them it might as well have been a single step. The thunder clap of their meeting sent unleashed chaos in the room.
So much happened so fast that Mandri couldn’t keep track.
On the floor, three beetles jumped at once—maybe it was more, he wasn’t sure because the blur of bodies and limbs was terrifying. At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. Before Mandri could flick the tip of his sword, Moto brought his blade down on that hag beetle’s back, and in a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue right behind the beetle’s head.
This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him. Though it’s head tumbled to the floor, it’s body wasn’t fully dead yet—it seized and spasmed, one of its human-handfeet slapped Mandri in the cheek. Mandri would have laughed if it weren’t for the sight of another hag beetle up on the ceiling. It dropped. Things fall faster when they’re falling at you.
This beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri’s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle’s neck and right onto Mandri’s face. The living beetle’s spike flew out of its back, but the dumb thing missed Mandri’s nose because the its eyes were on top its head. It struck out again, and missed again. Twice more, the spike tap-tapped against the stone.
“Dumb bitch!” Mandri shouted.
The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that it’s fishy eyes were staring down right at him.
“Oh, shit.”
Mandri tugged hard on the dead body between them, and as the spike flew down at his face it met instead with the dead beetle’s shell. The beast tried to pound through it like a hammer. Mandri hid himself until somehow, by the grace of Solraheen, that dumb beetle’s severed head fell right in front of his nose.
Purl pulled Mandris sword out of it and said, “Get up.”
Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles, but his hips and thighs were pinned. 
“Give me a hand,” he said.
“Really?!” said Purl. She had one good hand and wasn’t about to drop the sword.
“Kick it off me!”
Purl kicked the top beetle off him, and Mandri was able to push himself free from the other. He got to his feet, wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage—eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smushed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back along the hall. One of these ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the demon, and it was sliced in half by the lizard’s thrashing tail.
Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his spear so fast that it seemed to curved and snap suddenly straight against the lizard’s fending tail. Sparks flew, and the demon recoiled and raged and leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand, then its tail, knocking Ayram’s bar aside as the next set of talons were coming round. Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below the blow, to leave nothing but a swirl of dust between them.
Only now that they were standing still could Mandri see how much they’d ravaged eachother. The demon’s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram’s robe had been half-clawed off and ribbons of flesh hung off his side, exposing the yellow fat, the red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time that he exhaled.  
Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked Moteah’s rump.
“Help him!” the old witch shouted.
Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag-beetles easily enough, but the Newborn was an enemy beyond them.
“Go!” Elrahet screamed.
Moteah took off running towards the battle. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first.
They got halfway to Ayram when the lizard noticed their coming. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and crouched down like a cat, its long tail raised like a scorpion. Outnumbered, it slowly retreated down the hall.
“It’s scared!” said Moto as he and his sister took up positions at Ayram’s bleeding side.
Ayram spat a glob of red and said, “Careful. Don’t let it—”
The newborn jumped.
It jumped all the way up to the ceiling, then bounded off it and over the heads of the three warriors. It hit the ground running straight for Mandri, Elrahet, and Purl.
Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled horror underneath its permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift bounds. Wide-eyed, Mandri stared down his final moments with a terrified calm. Time seemed to condense, allowing him to appreciate the beauty of his killer. This demon was enormous, strong, sleek, and aside from its flapping jaw, it was perfectly symmetrical. No ugly ears. Its scaly skin glistened in the sheen of its afterbirth. Its final leap was tremendous. The sheer size could swallow him up. Curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery—it rolled under Ayram’s spear, which missed.
But the lizard’s bladed tail didn’t miss—it ripped a gash right across Ayram’s exposed stomach.
The lizard crashed into Mandri and sent him sprawling. 
When Mandri recovered, he expected to look up and see the demon hollowing out his chest.
It was on the floor, lifeless. 
Elrahet’s blade was hilted in the top of its skull.
Ayram sank to his knees. A stream of blood issued from the fissure in his stomach.
Elrahet screamed as she ran and caught the giant in her bosom.
Moteah and Moto sprinted up behind. 
“Let me see,” said Moto.
Ayram’s strength gave way and he slumped down onto the old witch’s shoulder. Moto and Moteah seized his arms before Elrahet crumbled under his weight, and they all helped him down to the ground. Elrahet gently laid his head down on the stone and wiped away the muck of battle from his brow with her thumb.
“My child,” said Elrahet. “My child…this I can not heal.”
Ayram’s great heads were clutching at his stomach. His breathing was staggered and wet. He looked at his witch, and his eyes seem filled with fright. He tried to speak—Elrahet shushed him with a finger to her lips.
“I know,” she said. “I know…I will sing your name to Solraheen, and He will know. He will know.”
Ayram’s eyes darted to Moto. He reached out with his bloody hand and his fingers found the strength to grasp Moto’s arm as tight as vice. For a brief moment, the two men beheld each other, shared an unspoken word, then Ayram’s fingers loosened and the light went out of his eyes.
He was dead.</Text>

            <Title>Togetherness</Title>
            <Text>The moment the red sun’s bottom lip kissed the west, Ayram set out into the Sand. He never announced it was time to leave or that everyone should think about heading out, he simply gathered up his enormous backpack and started off.
Mandri didn’t notice Ayram walk off because he was engrossed by the colors in the sky, which were darkening into an unusual reddish tint. It was a shade he’d only seen in rotting berries. The whole sky was flush with this startling purplish red, he followed the gradient arc around to the east, and there, suddenly, some hundred yards away, was Ayram—a giant lumbering towards a featureless horizon. Beyond Ayram was a much smaller black dot named Seb. Seb had set out even earlier after complaining about how slow everyone was and that he was going to do what he wanted to do. Nobody tried to stop him.
When Elrahet was good and ready to leave, she told Moto to bring the cursed Mazid with him, and she waddled, packless, out into the Sand. Moto turned to Purl and said, “You heard the woman, bring the Mazid with you,” and then he jogged off after the others. The clank of iron and wood inside his own heavy pack was his teasing laughter.
Mandri waited. When Moteah started out, he got up to follow, but was stopped when Moteah said, “Where are you going? You’re carrying the Mazid.”
Mandri moved to gather Obo up, but Purl shooed him away, and said, “Wait.” She wasn’t done staring at the Mazid, who at this point had been gagged by a gray rag. Mandri could hardly guess at what she was trying to do, so instead he sat down on a bump of Minting Rock’s rubble, hands idle, and studied her features.
Purl fit the standard rule of thumb for beauty that’s taught to artists at an early age—don’t make too many marks. People start to look ugly if one makes too many marks to bring out the features. If Mandri were to paint Purl with as few marks as possible, he wouldn’t be lying all that much, for the redding light of the oncoming night was flattening her red, kell-oiled skin. A few soft swoops would capture the sheen of the sky as it defined her high arched cheeks and the youthfulness of her lips, and that was almost it.
But if one sits and stares at another human being for long enough, the features of the face start to lose the illusion that they’re working together for a purpose. It doesn’t matter how attractive the person is, because everyone has ugly things about them. And these aren’t beauty marks that when juxtaposed against perfection enhance it.
Purl had ears. Peeking out underneath her sun-licked, frazzled bush of wiry hair were tiny ears. Mandri hated ears, those odd, fleshy protuberances. It’s as if, when Solraheen was creating people, He took a wad of clay, crumpled it up, and then slapped it onto the side of the head expecting to come back to it later to make it work but never did.
Everyone has breath—that’s not quite part of one’s physical appearance, but the breath! If there was ever a sign of what a person is, it is the stench of breath. Cover it up with a swig of acidic pango juice, but that never lasts last long. Little wonder that Jeket has a whole market square dedicated to tinctures and chews that are supposed to suppress the smell of the curdled things hiding in between the teeth, or pasting the tongue, or tucked into tonsil folds. 
But ignore all that.
Get down to the basics.
Study the structure of the face.
There is not one person alive whose face is symmetrical. There is always, always, some feature which started growing in the wrong direction as a child and kept going with age. Or maybe it didn’t grow fast enough to keep up with the rest when puberty hit. Titled noses. Slanted jaws. Most common is the uneven eyes, or uneven eyebrows. Sometimes the whole face swivels around to one side, and so one cheek gets slapped more than the other. Or it was smushed that way as the head squeezed out of the womb and it stuck, leaving the mentioned with a lopsided smile.
The only parts of the body Mandri liked to look at were the ones he generally wasn’t allowed to look at—a cosmic cruelty, but one he didn’t fret about, because the only reason he liked to look at those bits was because he wasn’t allowed to. He used to be fascinated by the sparkling eye, but his brush spent so much time nibbling them them that they’d lost their charm. They were nothing but squishy wet orbs squelching around in their sockets. And as it is for outer beauty, so it is for inner beauty as well. Mandri was certain that if he got close enough to Purl, that if he got a whiff of her breath, so to speak, then the illusion that she was something kind, or cherished, something more than a walking, talking sack of Sparked meat would crumble. 
Still, she had no obvious tells. Her hawkish features were tailor made for frowning, which was Mandri’s preference—a frowning, serious woman. She was even frowning right now. She stood, hands and nub on hips, that timeless pose of the woman waiting for an idiot, and she was frowning.
She was frowning at him.
“Uh, what?” he asked.
“You’re carrying the Mazid,” she said.
Mandri said, “Alright,” and then he stood up, and walked over to where Obo was resting. Obo had a gag tied over his mouth.
Purl said, “Use the frame.”
There was a wooden, L-shaped frame fitted with straps sitting next to Obo. It was the same device morning walkers used to haul sacks of grain to work off drought debt. Mandri tied Obo into it. The frame was the perfect size for Mandri’s scrawny back, and it had a waist strap that pulled fast around his stomach, and that kept Obo’s weight resting kindly on top of his hips. He bounced up and down to test its weight, and was delighted to find that his chewed-up leg had made a remarkable recovery.
“Thought he’d be heavier,” Mandri said.
“If you can carry more...”
“Oh, no. No. It’s more than heavy enough.” Mandri made a show of shifting the weight on his shoulders. Purl’s own pack was a huge, canvas wrapped lump in the shape of a bean, with the head of it looming against the upward puff of her hair.
“How far is it,” Mandri asked.
“The Bullr basin lies a hundred miles east of here.”
“One hundred miles? That far?”
Purl’s response was to start walking.
Mandri followed after her. “That’s what, ten days?”
“It depends on Ayram,” she said. “Ten days for him would be slow. Have you ever walked for ten days straight?”
“No.”
He looked to see if they were following one of the old charnel roads. If it was there he couldn’t see it, as there was no gentle hump in the earth stretching off into the horizon. It was flat, and even flatter further on.
Mandri returned to the subject of Purl’s ugliness—her inner ugliness. He hadn’t seen it yet, but was determined to find it out, and an easy way to capture a thing like that was to ambush it. He waited for her to settle into the inertia of the journey, and then pounced.
“What’s wrong with you?”
“Excuse me?”
“It seems like there’s something wrong with you.”
She shrugged and moped along, staring at the ground. He wondered if she had been mulling over that very question right before he’d asked it.
“Too many things,” she said, and Mandri felt a little shame as she fussed with the tangles in her hair with her one good hand. He’d only been looking for threads to pull and she was about to hand him a ball of yarn.
“But what kind of question is that?” She asked. “You know, it’s a good thing that you’re out here.”
“Why is that?”
“Because the Sand is going to lick your spit until you’re dry.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“Oh, you’ll find out.”

“So what’s this about a killing this demon of demons?”
“You mean the Amalgamete?”
“Yeah.”
“How much do you know about the death cults Schisol has seeded in the Sand?”
“Schisol?”
“You’ve never heard of the god of all destruction.”

If you had a Spark, what would you do with it? 
I honestly don’t know. I have my wants, but I think if I had a Spark, my wants would change.
I think you would.
For the same reason Mandri has’t left yet.
“I’m allowed to leave?”
Then give me a Spakr.
I can’t.
I thought Elrahet said.
“I can’t.”

Mandri asked, “Am I allowed to leave?”
Her grin crept wide and she nodded, and her hair brushed up against her bean-bag backpack. “You’ve always been allowed to leave. But you haven’t and you won’t.”
“I haven’t had the opportunity.”
“That’s not why,” she said with confidence. She then stopped walking and pointed off to her right, to an isolated patch of nearby scrub bush. Zooming around the tousled branches was a swarm of pinprick dots. There were so many tiny flies that it looked like the bush had a misty, black aura.
“Only Solraheen knows how many hook flies there are,” she said. “Flies can go anywhere—they can walk along the ground, they can fly in every direction, they can explore the entire world and see sights unseen—but they don’t. They hover in that small, boring spot of air out here in the desert. You know why?”
“Why?” Mandri asked, bracing himself for a bit of folksy outland wisdom.
“Hook flies swarm like that because even though the world is vast and beautiful, the most interesting thing in it is each other.”
Purl gave Mandri a considerate smile of unquestionable sincerity. Then she resumed her journey, leaving Mandri standing stock still, looking at those stupid flies.
Like most figures of speech, Purl’s analogy had a surface charm that suggested a deeper truth, but it completely broke down upon further investigation. Those flies weren’t flying around in a ball because of the fulfillment they received from some exciting sense of togetherness. There were more primal interests at play. Maybe they’d found water there in that bush, or food, or the bush broke the breeze making it easier to fly in the first place. Most likely it was about sex. They bunch up into a cloud like that because it is the easiest way to bump their stiff little uglies into something that makes them feel alive. Maybe one could say that still lines up with Purl’s notion of togetherness, but Mandri didn’t get the feeling that’s what she meant. In fact, these Ayramun were the least lascivious group of people he’d ever known—he’d not seen a single lip-licking wink between any of them, and he had been looking carefully.
She called back to him, “Don’t fall behind!”
He called back, “I have to pee.”
Purl hiked her bean pack further up on her shoulders and continued on. Her pack was so large that it had its own momentum, and she had to move slowly and build up speed until the pack’s forward motion began to sustain itself.
The very moment she was out of whisper range, Obo started wiggling around in his seat, and he issued a muffled plea to have his gag removed. Mandri groaned and reached back and slipped the knot keeping Obo’s gag fastened tight.
“Isn’t she interesting,” said Obo.
“Not really,” said Mandri, lying. “What makes you say that?”
“I think they’re a death cult.”
“A death cult?” Mandri asked, concerned.
Obo’s bright voice was threaded with excitement as he explained. “They match the pattern—the way they handled those giant corpses inside of Minting Rock, and the way they gathered up those who fell in battle, Hrk and Ayramun alike, into one big pile. Most would keep them separate.”
“That pile of bodies was supposed to be a sphere,” said Mandri as he recalled the back-breaking work he’d done to haul those rocks around.
“That fits. Compress them all into a tight ball, for in death all Sparks will be joined together.”
“Killing everyone would bring peace on earth, wouldn’t it?”
Suddenly, Mandri had to pee. As he relieved himself, a small brown lizard came crawling out of the sand to lick at the beads of urine that splashed down.
He said, “But if they want everything to die, then why bring me back to life? Why free Solraheen?”
“I don’t know.”
“How many Ayramun did they start out with? Fifty?”
“I believe it was forty-three.”
Mandri scanned the horizon—it was wide open space in every direction. There weren’t any hills to hide behind, but the shadows behind every bush were dark as Fabled Black.
He said, “What do you say to walking off in a different direction?”
“You may be allowed to leave, but I doubt they’ll be happy if you take me with you. I think the correct decision is to continue on.”
Mandri wiggled his member and dropped his robe.
“Let it be said that I think this is a bad idea.”</Text>
            <Notes>You think that’s what they’re trying to do - free schisol?



Need to rework intro to make it a SCENE

A number of things can happen after a question like that.
Mopey people, like Mandri, might find no offense and immediately jump in to listing everything they hate about themselves. 
Arrogant people, like Mandri, might take extreme offense, especially if they think they’re better than the person asking the question—‘What’s wrong with me? What’s wrong with you!?’
Considerate people, like Purl, gave the question more credit than it was worth. She would assume that Mandri was observant and that he had some specific fault in mind, when in reality he was only looking for threads to pull.</Notes>

And you know how they accomplish that? Through an order built upon respect for Solraheen’s sacrifice. If you try to free Him, and let’s say you fail, because you will, then I very much doubt the Lords would be able to contain the frenzy that follows. Think of it—outland pokes seek to undo Solraheen’s sacrificial will—the people will be incensed. The most destructive force in all the world is a mob motivated by righteous fury.

            <Title>Salt Farm</Title>
            <Text>Two years ago, Mandri sold what little he owned and bought a farm ten miles outside of Meskalim. Gil, he’d rescued from a leech farm. The poor old ox had been tied into a box that kept him still while the leeches fed on him. It was a horrible thing. Two wooden bars were under his legs to keep him standing or else he’d have collapsed into the swamp from pain and exhaustion.
Mandri tried growing burgeon bushes, but his land was not good for it. It wasn’t good for anything because when he bought the place the dirt was already worn out. He didn’t know that at the time because he didn’t know anything about farming. The first few plantings were fine, but after that, any time a strong rain came it sucked the salt up out of the ground and it all pooled on the surface, so that his field looked like a sweaty brown salt-stained tunic that had been left to dry out in the sun.
The only thing that would grow was a solitary hornscrub tree. It grew right smack-dab in the middle of the field. The tree’s shade was the only place to laze the days away, and lazing there meant Mandri and Gil would have to look upon the dead earth and scattered stalks of failure. 
It was no matter, though. Peace of mind could be bought for the price of a burgeon.
Mandri found that if he mixed the burgeon’s juice into a milky-white barley beer that he’d left steeping in a hole in the ground, well, two mouthfuls of that and every worry melted away. 
He took one mouthful because he wanted to ease into it.
It was a beautiful sunny day. There was even a breeze, and the sound of a cool breeze sifting through the boughs of his hornscrub tree was pleasing.
It’s not something that can be captured by a painting.
In truth, nothing can.
Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed.
The problem was always the same—art is misdirection, it diverts attention away from what is truly there to what the artist wants the audience to see. The artist boils reality down into something digestible. They boil it down to a single tangible lump of something which has them transfixed—a flower, a pretty face, or some redemptive story. What matters is that they try to preserve the things that make life worth living by ripping them out of the rest of reality and stitching their hides to a frame. Then, after having captured and killed the sublime, they sell it.
And that’s the fact of it.
Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed.
Every. Single. One.
Mandri burped, and took another swig of his burgeon beer.
It was hard not to think about painting.
What a cruel thing to do to Nature.
Paint an oasis, and in so doing he’d be forced to reduce a palm leaf to a fleck of green. The beauty of a living leaf—its complexity, its pattern, its anastomosing veins pumped full of vital fluids, its birth and death and eventual decay, the role it plays on the branch, the branch on the tree, the system within a system, a whole universe unto itself nested inside a greater one—all that complexity, that beauty, reduced to a fleck of green.
Reduced, because again, the artist has something more important he wants you to look at. There’s a naked woman bathing in the mossy water. There’s no need to properly render the leaf. In fact, rendering that leaf, giving it light and shadow and form, that would only distract the eye from the droplets of jade gleaming on her cinnamon skin. The sensible thing to do, if he had to paint the leaf, was to slightly feather its edge into the sky so that eye doesn’t get caught on a hard line of verdant green set against a chalky blue. He might remove the leaf and the tree altogether if the thing doesn’t slide a wandering eye down towards the temptress’ bosom. And then he’d really done it, he’d not only reduced the leaf down to a daub of color, he’d erased it from existence entirely.
Maybe someone could say that he wasn’t trying to paint Nature, he was trying to paint a woman, and so of course he wouldn’t capture Nature’s essence, but that hardly matters. “Go and try and paint Nature,” Mandri said to Gil as his ox napped the noon away. “Take as long as you like. Take a lifetime. Take ten lifetimes! Then… and then…”
And then he forgot what he was on about because hairs on Gil’s hide were starting to swirl. They only swirled a little bit. A more intense, boiling swirl was something that only happens when Mandri took black-eye burgeons, and only then if he picked them fresh and got to their juice before it was ever exposed to the air.
Down-valley burgeon beer, the kind which he was drinking, does something entirely different. Things will swirl, edges will bleed, but only a little. The chief effect was that anything bright would sparkle—Gil’s stubby white horns, the sunlight on the dusty earth, the puffs of cloud in the sky, pretty much everything that wasn’t hidden in shadow would sparkle. Most interestingly, the burgeonsight made it look like the salt stain on his field was squirming around. That was always a delight because it made it feel like he hadn’t lost a battle to an inanimate thing, that the salt was alive, a flood of wriggling white mites gnawing at the few decaying plants.
At least he’d managed to feed something.
He nestled deeper into the tree trunk’s embrace, and he sighed a little half-sipped, absent sigh, the kind of sigh that he’d start to make whenever he was ready for a nap. He let his eyelids slouch as he watched the flies buzz in and out of Gil’s snout. The ox would snore and blow those fuzzy black dots out of his great big nostrils, and then those flies would zip back in to lick at the only reliable source of moisture that they could find in this godforsaken field.
“Are you Mandrameen?”
Burgeon beer had never given Mandri an extra inner voice before. Odd that it should sound like an old hag. It was an unwelcome development. He did not want to pursue it.  He wanted to sleep.
“Go away,” he said.
But it didn’t go away. It kicked him in the shin.
“Ow!”
The pain pricked Mandri’s mind back into the moment. He opened his eyes and was stunned to see an old witchy woman wrapped in black standing before him.
He’d heard of burgeonsight granting visions, but it had never happened to him. He tried to blink the old woman away, but she was a stubborn vision. He picked up a little pebble and threw it at her. 
It hit her square on the nose.
“Ack!”
She wasn’t ready for it. Her arms flew up in a billow of black robe, and she staggered back a step.
She was real.
Mandri’s first instinct was to drink as much of his jumped-up beer as he could, because no doubt this hag would try to steal it.
Then again, she might not know what it was. It looked like milk. And it would be a waste to drink it all in one go—it would knock him out, and what was the point of that? No, that wouldn’t do. This was a special drink. He’d made plenty of special drinks, but this one was extra special because it was right here, a thing of the present. He could maybe try to hide it, tuck the clay jug away somewhere, maybe just nudge it behind the tree, but no doubt that harpy’s eyes were—
“Something wrong with you, boy?” 
The woman’s voice was dire. She stared him down, and Mandri peered into the shadow of her blue-and-black shawl. He couldn’t find her eyes behind a nasty squint and a nose that was impossible to reason with. She wasn’t too old, just sun-leathered, and dammit she was tall. Too tall for an old woman. That was man’s air she was breathing.
“I’ll ask again, are you Mandrameen?”
She must be strong too, because her back bore a large canvas sack. Nearly doubled her size. And she hadn’t come adorned with the usual veneer of civilization—no shine-black bracelets, or bangles, or silver hoop earrings, no makeup or red-thread leaves trimming her robe. The only ornament she carried was a turtle-shell comb that she kept fashionably crooked in her waistband. The rest of her tawny self seemed slapped together in a reed hut on the banks of the Jek river. She was a feral thing, dirty with perfect teeth, all of them perfectly straight and sun-bleached. The burgeonsight made them sparkle. They practically outshone the sun.
She kicked his shin again.
“Ow!” Mandri moaned. “Dammit, yes, I’m Mandri.”
“Do you still have your testicles?” 
Her teeth flashed as she spoke. Her head pitched into a suspecting tilt. “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
Mandri shook his head in disbelief.
“Just because I don’t go in for the haggard women of Meskalim, that doesn’t make me a—what are you on about anyways?”
“Answer my question.”
“Of course I have my—hold on, who are you?”
“You have your testicles,?”
“Yes.”
“You’re not lying?”
“Did Lora send you?”
The woman unshouldered her heavy pack. It hit the ground with a dull thump, and this disturbed Gil, who raised his heavy head. The ox saw the woman, gave a snort, then promptly went back to sleep. 
Without asking if Mandri minded, the woman sat down upon her pack. She sat down right in front of his feet. Then she pulled from her ragged robe a brown paper booklet. This booklet had no cover, and its makeshift spine was composed of peeling wax and fraying twine.
She laid the booklet flat on her lap and flipped through a few pages. There weren’t many of them. Mandri craned his neck to see if he could read what was there, but the burgeonsight made that impossible. Edges were starting to bleed together. If he drank too much more, things might get screwy.
“So, you are Mandrameen,” the woman said as she flattened an unruly page with her palm.
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. This time he was more demanding.
“I am Pel,” she said.
“Go away, Pel.”
Pel smirked. “I’m going to ask a few questions, and then I’ll be on my way.”
Mandri took another swig of beer. He tried to reason out why she was here. By the looks of her, she didn’t have any money, so if it was about money, she was here to take it. If that little book of hers was a book of debts, well, Mandri would not be able to pay up.
“Where are you from, Pel?”
“I come from that which everything comes—the all-white Spark.”
“Oh, you’re one of those.”
“And what is that?”
“An itinerant priest.”
“Priestess,” Pel corrected. “My god is—”
“The gods are all dead,” said Mandri, interrupting.
“Not my god. I serve the Amalgamete.”
“Never heard of him.”
“I would be a poor servant if you had.”
“Well…good. Keep it to yourself.”
Pel gave a bemused sigh and flipped through her pages. “You’re drooling,” she said disdainfully. 
Mandri wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Burgeons can make a mess of a person, but he wasn’t so far gone yet. A peculiar thing about this particular brew was that it left his wits untouched. Well, mostly untouched. Maybe a little touched. Toddler touched. Honestly, Mandri wasn’t sure. He knew it wasn’t safe to reason about reason when burgeons were involved.
Mandri said, “I’ve never seen a priest without a pound of gold or silver rattling around his neck.”
“Me and mine are struggling at the moment.”
“Then your god must not be a very strong god.”
“Oh, but He is getting stronger by the day.”
“How is that?”
“He grows as anyone does, he eats. He eats and grows stronger. He is going to—Ah, here you are. Mandrameen Andramawmun. That is your full name?”
Pel underlined his name with her finger.
Mandri nodded.
“You have a good name,” Pel said. “A strong Jandri name. An Old Jandri name. That’s good. And my notes say you started learning how to paint at the age of five. Is that right?”
Mandri’s eyes narrowed. If this woman was looking for an artist for some backwater temple icon, she’d come to the wrong place. Unless she had money.
“Do you have money?” he asked.
Pel either didn’t hear him, or pretended not to. She kept on reading from her book.
“My scribblings say you were a decent painter.”
She looked up to gauge Mandri’s reaction. This was some kind of challenge. He would not indulge her, though, high as he was, his face might be doing things all its own. That’s another thing about burgeons—it numbs the face but muscles sometimes keep moving. He could be making kissy lips at her right now and he wouldn’t know it unless he focused.
“It says you have a…” Pel bent down to get a better look at the words. “It says you’ve a triptych hanging in the garden of Zee.”
Mandri nodded. 
“It is hanging inside the garden?”
“Yes.”
“You couldn’t make it into the house?”
Mandri blanched at the insinuation. He said, “You’re a right old hag, aren’t you? You know what? You can leave. I don’t care if you’ve brought money, I’m not going to paint anything for you.”
“I’m not here to commission you.”
Mandri wilted.
“Well, whatever you’re here for, I don’t want it. Leave.”
Pel reached into her robe and pulled out a full silver string of little round coins. They sparkled magnificently.
“You’re in want of money?” she asked.
Mandri’s face must have been doing somersaults because the old woman looked almost frightened of him.
She said, “I will pay you to answer questions.”
“Questions about what?”
“Have you ever heard the word ‘gaburshegee’?”
“I’ve heard of burshegee.”
“Would you consider yourself to be ‘fertile ground’ or ‘infertile ground’?”
“Hold on, I’ve already answered one question.” 
He held out his hand like a beggar.
Pel untied the silver string. She unthreaded a shining disc and tossed it. Despite Mandri’s inebriated state, he snatched the coin out of the air. It was strangely light in his hand, an unfamiliar mint, and he couldn’t parse any of the identifying marks for the burgeonsight blurred it all underneath a smattering of sparkles. It wasn’t a Hrkan coin, anyways.
He said, “What’s this all about, anyways? You’re looking for a eunuch? They’re all in Jeket, aren’t they?”
“It is said that the Amalgamete shall find His strongest champions by planting Sparks in infertile ground. This phrasing is open to interpretation, but I think I know what it means.”
“It means you have to find a bunch of eunuchs?”
“No, I don’t think so, but it never hurts to check. I’m more inclined to believe that I am looking for disaffected artists, but whenever interpretations overlap in the same person, it makes it all the more likely that they are special. You see, the prophecy was written in Old Jandri, using the word ‘gaburshegee’, which means ‘infertile ground’ which can be translated as ‘eunuch’. It can also mean ‘impotent artist’, or ‘useless artist’. It could simply mean ‘infertile ground’. And here you are. I would say that a failed painter who tends a fruitless farm might qualify. Wouldn’t you agree?”
Mandri held out his hand again and said, “Pay in advance.”
“Curb your greed,” Pel said flatly. “I’ve plenty more questions to ask.”
She flipped to another page in her book. Then she flipped right back to where she’d been. 
“I might be skipping things I shouldn’t. Let me make sure…” She fingered a scribble, then read it aloud. “Have you ever prayed to Solraheen?”
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Answer the question, please. Have you ever prayed to the dead god Solraheen?”
“Of course I have, who hasn’t?”
Mandri held out his hand again.
Pel waved it away and said, “But have you spoken the words yourself? I’m not talking about being a part of a prayer circle as a child, where someone else does the heavy lifting. Have you ever run away to a quiet place and whispered words to Solraheen?”
“Who hasn’t?”
“Have you?”
Mandri tried to remember how many questions that made.
“One question at a time,” he said.
Pel cocked her eye, frowned, and scribbled something into her book.
“What’s that you’re writing there?”
Pel looked at him with a sinister eye.
“Can you read?” she asked.
“Of course I can read.”
“Then what does this say?”
She held the book open towards Mandri. The pages were blank.
“It doesn’t say anything.”
Pel tossed three more coins at him, and then she scribbled another secret nothing into her book.
“How many burgeons have you eaten?” she asked.
Mandri held out his greedy hand.
She said, “I’m not paying for that question.”
“I haven’t eaten any burgeons.”
“So you’re a liar?”
“I am not.”
“Hah! You should see your eyes. But that’s good. It’s good.” She jotted down another note. “You’re fitting the mold, Mandrameen. Does that excite you?”
“Are you going to pay for that question?”
“Mandri, if the prospect of becoming one of the Amalgamete’s champions does not excite you, then you’ve a dim Spark indeed.”
She flicked a coin into his lap.
“How do you feel about power over all, eternal life, and infinite pleasure?”
“I’ll take the pleasure,” said Mandri. “Leave the others.”
“Have you ever killed someone before?”
“No.”
“How do you feel about killing people?”
“What has that to do with any of this?”
A flash of annoyance cinched Pel’s weathered features, and she tossed another coin into Mandri’s lap, then repeated her question.
“How do you feel about killing people?”
Mandri didn’t want to answer, but suspected it was the only way to get this old hag to leave. “Killing someone…well, it depends, doesn’t it? The morality of something like that, it depends. Am I killing in self-defense? Are these, I don’t know, murderers?”
“You think that killing someone is a question of morality?”
“Isn’t it?”
“Let me rephrase—How do you feel about people?”
“How do I feel about people?”
The old woman’s squint was getting severe. She asked, “You wouldn’t mind if everyone dropped dead?”
“Did I say that?”
“Stop answering my questions with a question.”
“Look, everybody should be judged on their own merits…What is this prophecy anyways? I do something, and then a lot of people die?” 
“That’s generally how prophecies work—something happens, and a lot of people die.”
“But this prophecy, specifically, what happens?”
“In this prophecy, the Amalgamete’s champions will roam the earth and bring the fractured to His healing hands.”
“What does that have to do with people dying?”
“People are dying all the time. Right this very moment. And I don’t mean one or two, a lot of people are dying right now. All my god is going to do is make sure that everyone is dying for a purpose.”
“And you need me to help him do it?”
“Someone like you. Others as well. Many, if I am successful.”
“Not me?”
“It might be you.”
“Find someone else.”
The old witchy woman laughed. It was a grating laugh, half cackle, half delirious groan.
She said, “That’s not how prophecies work, my dear. I don’t pick someone to play the part. You are who you are, and if you are one of those who is prophesied, then that is that. No one can change it.”
“If no one can change it, then what are you even doing out here, looking around for this prophesied eunuch? You find him, or you don’t find him, it’s all the same.”
Pel sat back on her bag and seemed to cherish the chance to talk about herself.
“Have you ever had a lover?” she asked.
“Yes.”
“If you’ve ever had a lover, then you know what it’s like to wait for one.”
She looked up wistfully at the dance of the hornscrub boughs.
She said, “I’ve been waiting for my god’s coming for a very long time. I’ve grown impatient. I can think of nothing else but His arrival, so, I look out the window. That’s what I’m doing, in a manner of speaking, I’m here, looking out the window for a sign of His ascendance.”
Mandri scoffed at the thought of this old hag being anyone’s consort, much less a god’s. He shrugged to show his lack of concern and said, “Well, if I see Him, I will let you know.”
“Please, do.”
At that, Pel closed her book and tucked it back into her robes.
She said, “Go into Meskalim and talk to Salavan Soreen.”
“Why?”
“That’s the only way to know for sure if you’re one of those who I’m looking for.”
Pel stood up. Mandri, thinking she was about to leave, leaned back into his tree-crook and whispered a chime of praise.
“Oh, I’m not leaving yet,” Pel said. “There’s one last thing—I haven’t eaten in ages.”
“I don’t have any food.”
“Yes you do.”
She bent down and gave Gil a pat. Gil was awake now. His fat, bulging eyes were staring blankly off into the horizon.
“Gil’s not for eating,” Mandri said.
“Why not?”
“I’m not going to kill him just so you can nibble at his flank.”
“It’s not his flank that I want.”
“You can’t have any piece of him,” he said. “Gil isn’t for eating.”
“You named the creature, Gil?”
“I did.”
Gil mooed in recognition.
Pel jingled her silver string, prompting Mandri to add, “And he’s not for sale either.”
Pel grimaced and tucked the silver back into her robe. In the same motion, she drew a long, golden knife from an unseen sheathe. The sudden sight of this thin, curved blade was startling, and the old woman reached down to Gil’s neck before Mandri’s limbs had even stretched. With her free hand, Pel lifted Gil’s head, and she scraped her knife’s razor edge up and down against Gil’s throat. The poor beast, eager to get in a good scratch, closed his eyes and lifted his chin up higher to make sure Pel could scratch the whole length of it.
“What are you doing!?” Mandri said in alarm. “Let him be.”
“Why?”
“Because I said so.”
“All things die, dear Mandri. It’s near enough this ox’s time.”
“If you put one scratch on him, I’m going to break your jaw on my knee.”
“You’d do that? You’d kill me to save your ox?”
“Without hesitation.”
Pel lowered her blade. 
“That’s not good. That’s a mark against you.”
Mandri sprouted up to one knee and pointed down the road. “You need to leave,” he said.
Pel smiled, and said, “If you are one of the gaburshegee, then there’s an important lesson you need to learn. Better that it happens sooner than later.”
With an uncanny speed she cupped Gil’s snout under her arm and reached around his neck with her knife. She plunged her blade into the ox’s flesh. She drove it tight up against his jaw and abruptly yanked it round to the other side.
Gil let out a powerful bellow, deep and pitching, and his whole bulk lurched backwards, pulling his head from Pel’s grasp. Gil stood up on his knobbly knees and bucked as he did, knocking Pel on her ass, and then bolted off into the dusty field, bleeding and bleating as he went.  
Mandri, frozen by the sudden burst of blood and violence, watched on in horror as Gill came to a stop just ten yards away, as if realizing he had nowhere to go.
Gil stood stunned, head bowed, blood pouring into the earth. He looked back in confusion towards Mandri and Pel, looking back just in time to see his old master pick up a rock, snarl, and leap after the old hag.
One sharp elbow into the uglies sent Mandri sprawling to the ground.
“So, you’re not a eunuch”, Pel said with an awful sneer.
Mandri muttered a curse. He got to his knees and reached out to grab Pel’s robe, but the cloth seemed to melt between his fingers.
Pel jumped to her feet as if lifted by an unseen wind.
And then… 
And then Mandri saw something he couldn’t believe.
Pel flew in the air, straight like an arrow towards the dying ox. To Mandri’s burgeon-addled eyes she was nothing but a scowling head and billowing robe, and he saw, for the briefest moment, her green eyes flash wild with a bestial rage. The sound of her shriek was borne not from her lungs, but from the deepest depths of Shis.
She plunged head first into Gil’s body, tearing a hole into his belly as easily as if her nose were made of chipped obsidian. Gil crumpled to the ground, and Pel went with him, her head and shoulders fixed into his side.
Before Gil’s spine had the chance to spasm, Pel tore herself from his flesh with the neck of his first stomach clenched between her teeth. She spat it out, then ripped the rest of the innards from their lining and held the chain of stomachs up to the sun. Then her lips began to utter a speech as black as the deep of night. 
Mandri clasped his ears, but he could not look away. He prepared himself for some final gross barbarity. 
Instead, Pel’s chanting squeezed a bright point of light from Gil’s stomach, an amber colored light as bright as the sun. The witch sipped it into her chest through pursed lips, as one might sip a too-hot tea.
Satiated, she dropped Gill’s innards onto the dirt. The tension in her shoulders disappeared.
Next thing Mandri knew, she was standing above him. Her face was a withered sponge of blood, which the burgeonsight swirled into an even more terrifying horror.
“Go and see Salavan Soreen,” she growled. “I’ll be coming for your stomach if you don’t.”</Text>

            <Title>Salt Farm</Title>
            <Text>Two years ago, Mandri sold what little he owned and bought a farm ten miles outside of Meskalim. Gil, he’d rescued from a leech farm. The poor old ox had been tied into a box that kept him still while the leeches fed on him. It was a horrible thing. Two wooden bars were under his legs to keep him standing or else he’d have collapsed into the swamp from pain and exhaustion.
Mandri tried growing burgeon bushes, but his land was not good for it. It wasn’t good for anything because when he bought the place the dirt was already worn out. He didn’t know that at the time because he didn’t know anything about farming. The first few plantings were fine, but after that, any time a strong rain came it sucked the salt up out of the ground and it all pooled on the surface, so that his field looked like a sweaty brown salt-stained tunic that had been left to dry out in the sun.
The only thing that would grow was a solitary hornscrub tree. It grew right smack-dab in the middle of the field. The tree’s shade was the only place to laze the days away, and lazing there meant Mandri and Gil would have to look upon the dead earth and scattered stalks of failure. 
It was no matter, though. Peace of mind could be bought for the price of a burgeon.
Mandri found that if he mixed the burgeon’s juice into a milky-white barley beer that he’d left steeping in a hole in the ground, well, two mouthfuls of that and every worry melted away. 
He took one mouthful because he wanted to ease into it.
It was a beautiful sunny day. There was even a breeze, and the sound of a cool breeze sifting through the boughs of his hornscrub tree was pleasing.
It’s not something that can be captured by a painting.
In truth, nothing can.
Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed.
The problem was always the same—art is misdirection, it diverts attention away from what is truly there to what the artist wants the audience to see. The artist boils reality down into something digestible. They boil it down to a single tangible lump of something which has them transfixed—a flower, a pretty face, or some redemptive story. What matters is that they try to preserve the things that make life worth living by ripping them out of the rest of reality and stitching their hides to a frame. Then, after having captured and killed the sublime, they sell it.
And that’s the fact of it.
Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed.
Every. Single. One.
Mandri burped, and took another swig of his burgeon beer.
It was hard not to think about painting.
What a cruel thing to do to Nature.
Paint an oasis, and in so doing he’d be forced to reduce a palm leaf to a fleck of green. The beauty of a living leaf—its complexity, its pattern, its anastomosing veins pumped full of vital fluids, its birth and death and eventual decay, the role it plays on the branch, the branch on the tree, the system within a system, a whole universe unto itself nested inside a greater one—all that complexity, that beauty, reduced to a fleck of green.
Reduced, because again, the artist has something more important he wants you to look at. There’s a naked woman bathing in the mossy water. There’s no need to properly render the leaf. In fact, rendering that leaf, giving it light and shadow and form, that would only distract the eye from the droplets of jade gleaming on her cinnamon skin. The sensible thing to do, if he had to paint the leaf, was to slightly feather its edge into the sky so that eye doesn’t get caught on a hard line of verdant green set against a chalky blue. He might remove the leaf and the tree altogether if the thing doesn’t slide a wandering eye down towards the temptress’ bosom. And then he’d really done it, he’d not only reduced the leaf down to a daub of color, he’d erased it from existence entirely.
Maybe someone could say that he wasn’t trying to paint Nature, he was trying to paint a woman, and so of course he wouldn’t capture Nature’s essence, but that hardly matters. “Go and try and paint Nature,” Mandri said to Gil as his ox napped the noon away. “Take as long as you like. Take a lifetime. Take ten lifetimes! Then… and then…”
And then he forgot what he was on about because hairs on Gil’s hide were starting to swirl. They only swirled a little bit. A more intense, boiling swirl was something that only happens when Mandri took black-eye burgeons, and only then if he picked them fresh and got to their juice before it was ever exposed to the air.
Down-valley burgeon beer, the kind which he was drinking, does something entirely different. Things will swirl, edges will bleed, but only a little. The chief effect was that anything bright would sparkle—Gil’s stubby white horns, the sunlight on the dusty earth, the puffs of cloud in the sky, pretty much everything that wasn’t hidden in shadow would sparkle. Most interestingly, the burgeonsight made it look like the salt stain on his field was squirming around. That was always a delight because it made it feel like he hadn’t lost a battle to an inanimate thing, that the salt was alive, a flood of wriggling white mites gnawing at the few decaying plants.
At least he’d managed to feed something.
He nestled deeper into the tree trunk’s embrace, and he sighed a little half-sipped, absent sigh, the kind of sigh that he’d start to make whenever he was ready for a nap. He let his eyelids slouch as he watched the flies buzz in and out of Gil’s snout. The ox would snore and blow those fuzzy black dots out of his great big nostrils, and then those flies would zip back in to lick at the only reliable source of moisture that they could find in this godforsaken field.
“Are you Mandrameen?”
Burgeon beer had never given Mandri an extra inner voice before. Odd that it should sound like an old hag. It was an unwelcome development. He did not want to pursue it.  He wanted to sleep.
“Go away,” he said.
But it didn’t go away. It kicked him in the shin.
“Ow!”
The pain pricked Mandri’s mind back into the moment. He opened his eyes and was stunned to see an old witchy woman wrapped in black standing there before him.
He’d heard of burgeonsight granting visions, but it had never happened to him. He tried to blink the old woman away, but she was a stubborn vision. He picked up a little pebble and threw it at her. 
It hit her square on the nose.
“Ack!”
She wasn’t ready for it. Her arms flew up in a billow of black robe, and she staggered back a step.
She was real.
Mandri’s first instinct was to drink as much of his jumped-up beer as he could, because no doubt this hag would try to steal it.
Then again, she might not know what it was. It looked like milk. And it would be a waste to drink it all in one go—it would knock him out, and what was the point of that? No, that wouldn’t do. This was a special drink. He’d made plenty of special drinks, but this one was extra special because it was right here, a thing of the present. He could maybe try to hide it, tuck the clay jug away somewhere, maybe just nudge it behind the tree, but no doubt that harpy’s eyes were—
“Something wrong with you, boy?” 
The woman’s voice was dire. She stared him down, and Mandri peered into the shadow of her blue-and-black shawl. He couldn’t find her eyes behind a nasty squint and a nose that was impossible to reason with. She wasn’t too old, just sun-leathered, and dammit she was tall. Too tall for an old woman. That was man’s air she was breathing.
“I’ll ask again, are you Mandrameen?”
She must be strong too, because her back bore a large canvas sack. Nearly doubled her size. And she hadn’t come adorned with the usual veneer of civilization—no shine-black bracelets, or bangles, or silver hoop earrings, no makeup or red-thread leaves trimming her robe. The only ornament she carried was a turtle-shell comb that she kept fashionably crooked in her waistband. The rest of her tawny self seemed slapped together in a reed hut on the banks of the Jek river. She was a feral thing, dirty with perfect teeth, all of them perfectly straight and sun-bleached. The burgeonsight made them sparkle. They practically outshone the sun.
She kicked his shin again.
“Ow!” Mandri moaned. “Dammit, yes, I’m Mandri.”
“Do you still have your testicles?” 
Her teeth flashed as she spoke. Her head pitched into a suspecting tilt. “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
Mandri shook his head in disbelief.
“Just because I don’t go in for the haggard women of Meskalim, that doesn’t make me a—what are you on about anyways?”
“Answer my question.”
“Of course I have my—hold on, who are you?”
“You have your testicles,?”
“Yes.”
“You’re not lying?”
“Did Lora send you?”
The woman unshouldered her heavy pack. It hit the ground with a dull thump, and this disturbed Gil, who raised his heavy head. The ox saw the woman, gave a snort, then promptly went back to sleep. 
Without asking if Mandri minded, the woman sat down upon her pack. She sat down right in front of his feet. Then she pulled from her ragged robe a brown paper booklet. This booklet had no cover, and its makeshift spine was composed of peeling wax and fraying twine.
She laid the booklet flat on her lap and flipped through a few pages. There weren’t many of them. Mandri craned his neck to see if he could read what was there, but the burgeonsight made that impossible. Edges were starting to bleed together. If he drank too much more, things might get screwy.
“So, you are Mandrameen,” the woman said as she flattened an unruly page with her palm.
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. This time he was more demanding.
“I am Pell,” she said.
“Go away, Pell.”
Pell smirked. She said, “I’m going to ask a few questions, and then I’ll be on my way.”
Mandri took another swig of beer. He tried to reason out why she was here. By the looks of her, she didn’t have any money, so if it was about money, she was here to take it. If that little book of hers was a book of debts, well, Mandri would not be able to pay up.
“Where are you from, Pell?”
“I come from that which everything comes—the all-white spark.”
“Oh, you’re one of those.”
“And what is that?”
“You’re an itinerant priest.”
“Priestess,” Pell corrected. “My god is—”
“I’m sorry,” said Mandri, interrupting. “I may have intimated that I want to hear about your god. I don’t.”
Pell gave a bemused sigh and flipped through her pages. “You’re drooling,” she said disdainfully. 
Mandri wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Burgeons can make a mess of a person, but he wasn’t so far gone yet. A peculiar thing about this particular brew was that it left his wits untouched. Well, mostly untouched. Maybe a little touched. Toddler touched. Honestly, Mandri wasn’t sure. He knew it wasn’t safe to reason about reason when burgeons were involved.
Mandri said, “I’ve never seen a priest without a pound of gold or silver rattling around his neck.”
“Me and mine are struggling at the moment.”
“Then your god must not be a very strong god.”
“Oh, He is the weakest of all possible gods.”
“How is that?”
“Because he does not yet exist.”
“Oh. Well. A priestess who follows a god that does not exist.”
“He will exist. He is going to—Ah, here you are. Mandrameen Andramawmun. That is your full name?”
Pell underlined his name with her finger.
Mandri nodded.
“You have a good name,” Pell said. “A strong Jandri name. An Old Jandri name. That’s good. And my notes say you started learning how to paint at the age of five. Is that right?”
Mandri’s eyes narrowed. If this woman was looking for an artist for some backwater temple icon, she’d come to the wrong place. Unless she had money.
“Do you have money?” he asked.
Pell either didn’t hear him, or pretended not to. She kept on reading from her book.
“My scribblings say you are a decent painter.”
She looked up to gauge Mandri’s reaction. This was some kind of challenge. He would not indulge her, though, high as he was, his face might be doing things all its own. That’s another thing about burgeons—it numbs the face but muscles sometimes keep moving. He could be making kissy lips at her right now and he wouldn’t know it unless he focused.
“It says you have a…” Pell bent down to get a better look at the words. “It says you’ve a triptych hanging in the garden of Zee.”
Mandri nodded. 
“It is hanging inside the garden?”
“Yes.”
“You couldn’t make it into the house?”
Mandri blanched at the insinuation. He said, “You’re a right old hag, aren’t you? You know what? You can leave. I don’t care if you’ve brought money, I’m not going to paint anything for you.”
“I’m not here to commission you.”
Mandri wilted.
“Well, whatever you’re here for, I don’t want it. Leave.”
Pell reached into her robe and pulled out a full silver string of little round coins. They sparkled magnificently.
“You’re in want of money?” she asked.
Mandri’s face must have been doing somersaults because the old woman looked almost frightened of him.
She said, “I will pay you to answer questions.”
“Questions about what?”
“Have you ever heard the word ‘gaburshegee’?”
“I’ve heard of burshegee.”
“How about the prophecy of the Painted Eunuch?”
“Hold on, I’ve already answered one question.” 
He held out his hand like a beggar.
Pell untied the silver string. She unthreaded a shining disc and tossed it. Despite Mandri’s inebriated state, he snatched the coin out of the air. It was strangely light in his hand, an unfamiliar mint, and he couldn’t parse any of the identifying marks for the burgeonsight blurred it all underneath a smattering of sparkles. It wasn’t a Hrkan coin, anyways.
He said, “What’s this all about, anyways? You’re looking for a eunuch? They’re all in Jeket, aren’t they?”
“I’m looking for a young man who fits an old prophecy. The prophecy was written in Old Jandri, using the word ‘gaburshegee’, which means ‘fertile ground’ but is usually translated as ‘eunuch’. It can also mean ‘impotent artist’, or ‘useless artist’. It could simply mean ‘infertile ground’. And here you are. I would say that a failed painter who tends a fruitless farm might qualify. Wouldn’t you agree?”
Mandri held out his hand again and said, “Pay in advance.”
“Curb your greed,” Pell said flatly. “I’ve plenty more questions to ask.”
She flipped to another page in her book. Then she flipped right back to where she’d been. 
“I might be skipping things I shouldn’t. Let me make sure…” She fingered a scribble, then read it aloud. “Have you ever prayed to Solraheen?”
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Answer the question, please. Have you ever prayed to Solraheen?”
“Of course I have, who hasn’t?”
Mandri held out his hand again.
Pell waved it away and said, “But have you spoken the words yourself? I’m not talking about being a part of a prayer circle as a child, where someone else does the heavy lifting. Have you ever run away to a quiet place and whispered words to Solraheen?”
“Who hasn’t?”
“Have you?”
Mandri tried to remember how many questions that made.
“One question at a time,” he said.
Pell cocked her eye, frowned, and scribbled something into her book.
“What’s that you’re writing there?”
Pell looked at him with a sinister eye.
“Can you read?” she asked.
“Of course I can read.”
“Then what does this say?”
She held the book open towards Mandri. The pages were blank.
“It doesn’t say anything.”
Pell tossed three more coins at him, and then she scribbled another secret nothing into her book.
“How many burgeons have you eaten?” she asked.
Mandri held out his greedy hand.
She said, “I’m not paying for that question.”
“I haven’t eaten any burgeons.”
“So you’re a liar?”
“I am not.”
“Hah! You should see your eyes. But that’s good. It’s good.” She jotted down another note. “You’re fitting the mold, Mandrameen. Does that excite you?”
“Are you going to pay for that question?”
“Mandri, if the prospect of fulfilling a prophecy laid down at the dawn of time does not excite, then you’ve a dim Spark indeed.”
She flicked a coin into his lap.
“How do you feel about power over all, eternal life, and infinite pleasure?”
“I’ll take the pleasure,” said Mandri. “Leave the others.”
“Have you ever killed someone before?”
“No.”
“How do you feel about killing people?”
“What has that to do with any of this?”
A flash of annoyance cinched Pell’s weathered features, and she tossed another coin into Mandri’s lap, then repeated her question.
“How do you feel about killing people?”
Mandri didn’t want to answer, but suspected it was the only way to get this old hag to leave. “Killing someone…well it depends, doesn’t it? The morality of something like that, it depends. Am I killing in self-defense? Are these, I don’t know, murderers?”
“You think that killing someone is a question of morality?”
“Isn’t it?”
“Let me rephrase—How do you feel about people?”
“How do I feel about people?”
The old woman’s squint was getting severe. She asked, “You wouldn’t mind if everyone dropped dead?”
“Did I say that?”
“Stop answering my questions with a question.”
“Look, everybody should be judged on their own merits…What is this prophecy anyways? I do something, and then a lot of people die?” 
“That’s generally how prophecies work—something happens, and a lot of people die.”
“But this prophecy, specifically, what happens?”
“In this prophecy, the painted eunuch will free my god so that He may roam the earth and heal this fractured world.”
“What does that have to do with people dying?”
“People are dying all the time. Right this very moment. And I don’t mean one or two, a lot of people are dying right now. All my god is going to do is make sure that everyone is dying for a purpose.”
“And you need me to free him?”
“Someone like you will do it, yes.”
“Not me?”
“It might be you.”
“Find someone else.”
The old witchy woman laughed. It was a grating laugh, half cackle, half delirious groan.
She said, “That’s not how prophecies work, my dear. I don’t pick someone to play the part. You are who you are, and if you are the one who is prophesied, then that is that. No one can change it.”
“If no one can change it, then what are you even doing out here, looking around for this prophesied eunuch? You find him, or you don’t find him, it’s all the same.”
Pell sat back on her bag and seemed to cherish the chance to talk about herself.
“Have you ever had a lover?” she asked.
“Yes.”
“If you’ve ever had a lover, then you know what it’s like to wait for one.”
She looked up wistfully at the dance of the hornscrub boughs.
She said, “I’ve been waiting for my god’s coming for a very long time. I’ve grown impatient. I can think of nothing else but His arrival, so, I look out the window. That’s what I’m doing, in a manner of speaking, I’m here, looking out the window for a sign of His coming.”
Mandri scoffed at the thought of this old hag being anyone’s consort, much less a god’s. He shrugged to show his lack of concern and said, “Well, if I see Him, I will let you know.”
“Please, do.”
At that, Pell closed her book and tucked it back into her robes.
She said, “Go into Meskalim and talk to Salavan Soreen.”
“Why?”
“That’s the only way to know for sure if you’re the one I’m looking for.”
Pell stood up. Mandri, thinking she was about to leave, leaned back into his tree-crook and whispered a chime of praise.
“Oh, I’m not leaving yet,” Pell said. “There’s one last thing—I haven’t eaten in ages.”
“I don’t have any food.”
“Yes you do.”
She bent down and gave Gil a pat. Gil was awake now. His fat, bulging eyes were staring blankly off into the horizon.
“Gil’s not for eating,” Mandri said.
“Why not?”
“I’m not going to kill him just so you can nibble at his flank.”
“It’s not his flank that I want.”
“You can’t have any piece of him,” he said. “Gil isn’t for eating.”
“You named the creature, Gil?”
“I did.”
Gil mooed in recognition.
Pell jingled her silver string, prompting Mandri to add, “And he’s not for sale either.”
Pell grimaced and tucked the silver back into her robe. In the same motion, she drew a long, golden knife from an unseen sheathe. The sudden sight of this thin, curved blade was startling, and the old woman reached down to Gil’s neck before Mandri’s limbs had even stretched. With her free hand, Pell lifted Gil’s head, and she scraped her knife’s razor edge up and down against Gil’s throat. The poor beast, eager to get in a good scratch, closed his eyes and lifted his chin up higher to make sure Pell could scratch the whole length of it.
“What are you doing!?” Mandri said in alarm. “Let him be.”
“Why?”
“Because I said so.”
“All things die, dear Mandri. It’s near enough this ox’s time.”
“If you put one scratch on him, I’m going to break your jaw on my knee.”
“You’d do that? You’d kill me to save your ox?”
“Without hesitation.”
Pell lowered her blade. 
“That’s good. That’s good.”
Mandri sprouted up to one knee and pointed down the road. “You need to leave,” he said.
Pell smiled, and said, “If you are the gaburshegee, then there’s an important lesson you need to learn. Better that it happens sooner than later.”
With an uncanny speed she cupped Gil’s snout under her arm and reached around his neck with her knife. She plunged her blade into the ox’s flesh. She drove it tight up against his jaw and abruptly yanked it round to the other side.
Gil let out a powerful bellow, deep and pitching, and his whole bulk lurched backwards, pulling his head from Pell’s grasp. Gil stood up on his knobbly knees and bucked as he did, knocking Pell on her ass, and then bolted off into the dusty field, bleeding and bleating as he went.  
Mandri, frozen by the sudden shock of violence, watched on in horror as Gill came to a stop just ten yards away, as if realizing he had nowhere to go.
Gil stood there stunned, head bowed, blood pouring into the earth. He looked back in confusion towards Mandri and Pell, looking back just in time to see his old master pick up a rock, snarl, and leap after the old hag.
One sharp elbow into the uglies sent Mandri sprawling to the ground.
“So, you’re not a eunuch”, Pell said with an awful sneer.
Mandri muttered a curse. He got to his knees and reached out to grab Pell’s robe, but the cloth seemed to melt between his fingers.
Pell jumped to her feet as if lifted by an unseen wind.
And then… 
And then Mandri saw something he couldn’t believe.
Pell literally flew towards the dying ox. She flew straight like an arrow flung from a bow. To Mandri’s burgeon-addled eyes she was nothing but a scowling head and billowing robe, and he saw, for the briefest moment, her green eyes flash wild with a bestial rage. The sound of her shriek was borne not from her lungs, but from the deepest depths of Shis.
She plunged head first into Gil’s body and tore a hole into his belly as easily as if her nose were made of chipped obsidian. Gil crumpled to the ground, and Pell went with him, her head and shoulders fixed into his side.
Before Gil’s spine had the chance to spasm, Pell tore herself from his flesh with the neck of his first stomach clenched between her teeth. She spat it out, then ripped the rest of the innards from their lining and held the chain of stomachs up to the sun. Then her lips began to utter a speech as black as the deep of night. 
Mandri clasped his ears, but he could not look away. He prepared himself for some final gross barbarity. 
Instead, Pell’s chanting squeezed a bright point of light from Gil’s stomach, an amber colored light as bright as the sun. The witch sipped it into her chest through pursed lips, as one might sip a too-hot tea.
Satiated, she dropped Gill’s innards onto the dirt. The tension in her shoulders disappeared.
Next thing Mandri knew, she was standing above him. Her face was a withered sponge of blood, which the burgeonsight swirled into an even more terrifying horror.
“Go and see Salavan Soreen,” she growled. “I’ll be coming for your stomach if you don’t.”

            <Title>Meskalim</Title>
            <Text>Most Outland tribes believe that when the land was pulled up from the waters it came out as a solid whole, one earth surrounded by one ocean. When the sun rose it shined on everything at once—birds, bushes, beasts, and humans, as well as the twin brother gods, Solraheen and Schisol.
Schisol did not like this arrangement. Humanity was trampling all over His brother’s sacred gardens. He wanted humanity kept apart, so He smashed His fists into the ground and split the land in two. In one cataclysmic afternoon Jandri became an island continent. 
How great the trembling must have been when the Hias mountains were torn apart. How incredible it had to be to see an ocean of fish, shark, and noodly leviathan tumble into green valleys. It is said that for a day all the ocean beasts frolicked in the sumbmerged forests and fields, and all that movement is the reason why the waters of the Shalbrum sea flows so fast today.
But Schisol was an idiot. Having pushed Jandri out into the ocean, He unwittingly pushed it closer to the sun. The unremitting heat bore down on the lush environs, withering them into dust. In His bid to save His brother’s garden from the ravages of humanity, Schisol had destroyed it instead. To add insult to injury, humans eventually built boats and sailed across the sea, settling Jandri and spreading out to farm every inch of good black earth.
Meskalim was one of the first cities to rise up on the new continent. On the earliest maps it was nothing but a nameless black dot sitting halfway down Jandri’s western rim. Nobody cared for a small flesh market that merchant barges skipped on the way down around the horn and east to Jeket.
This all changed when a young slave girl slipped and fell into a hole. 
What that girl was doing in the foothills of the Hias mountains, so far from the city, only Solraheen knows. Some say that she was lured down into that hole by a demon, because the entrance to that abyss was nothing but a black sliver in the grass—impossible to find unless one knew where it was. But what’s important is that when the girl was rescued from the earth she was clutching a nugget of gold.
The shepherd who found her went back to that crack the next day with an oil lamp. Not twelve feet down and his eye caught the glint of a gold stringer slanting sideways through the granite. He followed it through a tight-fitting pocket, and there in that fracture he found a vein of gold that was wider than his arms could stretch. 
Mines were driven into the hills. This was ages before the age of Hrkan science, so no real thought was given to managing the uncountable tons of rock that were pressing down on the blooming network of tunnels. When the people of Meskalim dug into the earth they put up wood beams and packed the walls tight with a stiffening mud, but that was it. They didn’t understand that the granite there was fiercely jointed and that a beam supporting one rock might be doing nothing for another just a few inches away. It all looked like one big rock in the dim light of torches. The odd cave-in should have served as a warning. One might be tempted to say these ancient peoples didn’t understand the danger because they were blinded by greed, but the simpler truth was that they were invincibly ignorant. 
Meskalim became a golden city on the maps of a golden age. Its thousand white domes were enameled with sacred geometry. Its boulevards were filled with all the peoples of the world. Its army was twice the size of any other. Its port was the very center of the earth. 
All of this because of gold. Solraheen’s stone, called as such because gold is as bright and as immutable as the divine. Leave it in the dirt for a million years and it will stay as brilliant as the day it was interred. Roll it around in the hands and it provokes a yearning akin to spiritual rapture—a yearning for more, for as much as one can get.
The folk of Meskalim devoted their lives to it. They followed the gold wherever it went, and it went everywhere, even under the city itself. At the peak of the frenzy a person could get drunk and lost between Meskalim’s three hills, then dig straight down, and likely as not they’d pop out into a tunnel. 
One day a miner slammed his pick into the wrong hairline crack. A jet of water shot out, and the waters of the Shalbrum sea flooded in. When the thinned bedrock fell, the golden city above fell with it. More than five hundred thousand people were swallowed up in the slush of earth, though the number grows larger with each retelling.
Humans are redoubtable creatures when gold is at hand, so it didn’t take long for the city to be rebuilt from scratch further south. Meskalim the second swelled anew, though it would never be as grand as the first, for whenever a nugget of gold was pulled from the ground it was stored in a dockside warehouse before being shipped across the sea or down and around to Jeket. Folks feared the earth might open up at any time to eat their treasures, so common sense demanded that the wealth would be better used elsewhere.
And so, for a thousand years, Meskalim’s temple was poor and its people poorer. Its streets weren’t laid out with any sense, much less paved, and these mucky avenues didn’t adhere to the natural contours of the land because when someone wanted to build a house they simply plopped it down wherever inspiration struck. And these houses were ugly things, shouldn’t be called houses—they were dwellings, crumpled slugs of mud, lumber, and straw with windowless walls all askew. There wasn’t a true roof beam in all the lower city. A horde of these things were smashed up against each other like one big deposit of mud that the Istil wind had just happened to blow together.
Mandri couldn’t stand the sight of it unless he was deep in a burgeon binge.
Unfortunately, he had to pace his beer because he couldn’t afford to be so run through that he couldn’t walk. He had to feather the beer’s effect, take sips from his beer-skin every hundred staggered steps or so to keep himself bouncing off that point of no return. It was a dangerous game, taking off the edge in chunks, but it was one he was determined to play to avoid thinking. Primarily he was fleeing from the memory of that old witchy bitch’s bloody, haunting face. If he didn’t keep moving, she might pop out of the clouds and smash right through his belly like she’d done to Gil.
The constant patter of a wispy rain was helping to keep him grounded. And, dare he think it, Meskalim looked somehow pretty in the gray light of a sun shining though rain clouds. But surely, this beauty was the work of the burgeons. Mandri had seen his reflection in a puddle, and his pupils were blown so wide that the smallest slight of light could get in there, bounce around, and blind him to all ugliness. Every surface sparkled. The falling rain dazzled. Even the cool muck welling up between his toes as he splashed along Meskalim’s streets was flecked with radiant light.
The more Mandri drank, the more the burgeonsight played with light and wetness. It seemed as if the sparkling bits of light themselves were tangible, like he could get them glommed up in between his fingertips and lick them. Perhaps this oily celestial film that coated every surface was always there it took burgeonsight to see it.
He lingered in the middle of an empty crossroad, surrounded by some of the blobbiest mud-caked slums in all of Meskalim. Each roof was topped off with little nipple chimneys and there wasn’t a wooden door in sight—only rags hanging down to cover their lamplit, onion-smelling, fly-biting interiors. Mandrameen stood, motionless, back hunched, hair drenched, brown robe slipping off his shoulder, for he was struck dumb by the sight of his own hand.
He held it up and studied it. His own skin was sparkling. In the hollow of his palm was a pool of that starry substance. He tried to touch the little sparkles, tried to rub them off, but that was no good because his fingers were sparkling too. This wasn’t merely wetness, he was sure of it.
He licked his index finger and a heavenly sensation flooded into into his mouth. It was a tingling flavor that tasted like honey mixed with the vigor of youth. It tasted like the smell of a field of wildflowers. It tasted like apple-juice mixed with god.
He squealed with delight. 
He bent down and scraped up a dollop of mud with his finger, then licked it. Again, his mouth was flooded with the flavor. 
He rushed over to the nearest mud-caked wall, where an awning protected some large clay pots from the rain. He knelt down and licked the handles, the rims, the bodies. Again he tasted that divine flavor. There was a little brown pup shivering behind one of these pots, and Mandri picked the little beast up by it’s scruff and licked it, and it, too, tasted of heaven.
He dropped the pup and opened his mouth to the sky and tried to lick the air to check if the air itself was suffused with this substance. His tongue was caught mid-curl when a disgusted voice shot out of the rain, saying, “Get lost you freak!”
Mandri spun around, feet sliding in the mud. He raised his hands to defend himself, but there was no one there, nothing but glistening mounds of mud, soggy rags, and the sound of rain plunking off the broken clay pots that piled up in every nook and cranny.
Mandri couldn’t see the Meskalimi eyes peeping out at him, but he could damn well feel them. These destitutes were hiding in their hovels of slop and they were judging him.
Them judging him.
They could not see what he saw. Their dim-sighted eyes could only see a too-skinny young man standing in the muck, hackles raised, licking the air like a maniac.
“You do not see what I see!” Mandri shouted.
“Get lost!”
 Mandri spun around again, trying to place the voice, then hissed when he realized there might be more than one of them speaking out.
“I see Solraheen’s light!” he shouted.
“GET LOST!”
Mandri yelped and took off running.
He ran and ran, following the road wherever it was going. He stopped when he realized that he was liable to slip and crack his skull. He also realized he’d dropped his beer-skin somewhere along the way. He thought about going back and trying to find it, but that wasn’t possible, because he didn’t know where he was and what paths he’d taken to get here. 
There is one way to orient oneself inside Meskalim—memorize all the faces of Meskalim’s central hill. The hill towered over the rumps and clumps of mud that was the city proper. The hill itself was studded with proper white buildings, each clinging to the hill like barnacles on a washed up corpse. These were the various offices of Hrkan government, as well as the mansions of the people who staffed them. It just so happened that when Mandri looked up at Meskalim’s hill, he was looking at the house of Salavan Soreen. As governor of Meskalim, Salavan’s house claimed a privileged vista at the top of the hill’s southern cliff face. Its wide balcony leered over the rest of the city below, and over Mandri, reminding him what he was supposed to be doing. 
He set off at a stuttering trot.
Along the way he stole a knife, because who leaves a stout little knife laying outside in a bowl of kakanut shells? Someone who wants it stolen, that’s who. Mandri simply complied. He also needed it more, so by divine right it was his. 
He knotted the knife up in the folds of his robe that hung loose around his waist, and he found that if he bent forward a bit, then the bulge of the knife’s handle would get lost amongst the folds. So he walked, stooping a little, all the way up Meskalim’s hill. It was hard trudging. His legs were completely out of wire when he came upon Salavan’s house. The damned thing was surrounded by a monstrous white wall. If he was going to kill Meskalim’s governor, he needed it to move.
Mandri hated walls. He’d always believed that walls had gone too far beyond their original scope. The first walls were knee-high stacks of stones set out in pastures to mark boundaries between goat herds—a pure and wholesome purpose. This wall, Salavan’s wall, was among the most perverse. It was huge, four-men tall, and its purpose was to stand there and look daunting so that poor people didn’t get any ideas. Most walls that big in a place as wet as Meskalim are streaked with black and yellow grime dripping to the street, but Salavan’s wall was pristine. Its plaster was as smooth and as white as the day it was slathered on. No doubt Salavan spent more money cleaning that wall than he spent on bread for widows and orphans, or for anything for anyone. That wall was more important than human life, more important than Mandri’s life. That wall’s raw materials could buy at least fifty Mandrameens. Its maintenance? At least five Mandris a year.
At least this wall was doing a job in keeping him out. Some walls on the lower rungs of Meskalim’s hill couldn’t keep out a flying shit. They’re purely decorative. Imagine that—a decorative wall—it’s not even trying to fend off the poors, all it's doing is letting them know they aren’t liked.
Mandri stood there in front of Salavan’s wall like an idiot. The burgeonsight was warping all the little dimples and scratches and faint finger-drags that were imprinted there in the plaster. Mandri couldn’t shake the feeling that the wall was daring him, like a schoolyard bully, to just try to breach it and see what happens.
There was a squared-out arch in the middle of this wall, and underneath this arch was an ironwood gate guarded by two thugs on either side. These brawny men were huddled close to the gate so as to squeeze themselves inside the narrow shelter of the arch. It wasn’t doing them much good. They were as sodden as Mandri. Like everything else, the burgeonsight was making them sparkle. That didn’t stop them from looking like demons.
In the best of light, a Meskalimi thug’s face is an unsettling thing. A lifetime of trading violence for money fixes a man’s expression into a state of permanent concern, and once the brow and cheek gets slashed with scars, the whole thing takes on a look of putrefied misery. Blur that face a little with rain, twist it a little with burgeonsight, and now it’s a demon’s face that could bend the bravest spine. And that’s what Mandri saw when he looked at those two thugs guarding Salavan’s gate, he saw full-blooded demons.
And they had swords—short, street-wise swords clipped high up on the belt.
Mandri believed that his burgeonsight, waning though it was, revealed the truth and showed these ‘men’ for what they were—actual demons. They couldn’t be full-fledged demons, because such demons should be tasked with more important things than watching a gate. They would be greasing the feet of backsliding priests, or tricking young beauties into thinking that taking it up the bum doesn’t count.
It then occurred to Mandri that he didn’t know why he was actually going through with all this. Ostensibly, he was here to placate the fury of a demon witch, but until this moment, standing in front of this stupid white wall, he hadn’t actually considered the possibility of not showing up. Pell had told him to go and see Salavan, and now here he was, seeing about Salavan. 
Perhaps he wasn’t fully in control of his own faculties.
Perhaps Pell had puppeteered him.
Or perhaps it was the burgeons.
One of the demons peeked out from under the arch and shouted, “Hey—scram, boy!”
“Git yous butt gawn,” the other said. His vowels were as stubborn as a mule.
Do demons have regional accents?
It sounded like this demon grew up in a sun-slum near Iskabat.
The first demon had no doubt crawled out of a Jeketian gutter, for his lilt and swagger could only have come from someone steeped in the capital of the Hrkan world.
Mandri caught his wits and said, “I’m here to see Salavan Soreen.”
The two demons looked at each other. A whispered word was shared.
The first of them asked, “Why?”
The other asked, “Whatchu gawtta knife fur?”
Mandri looked down and saw that he was gripping his knife so tight that his knuckles were white. 
“Oh...uh…sorry.”
The demon from Iskabat pulled his short sword from its scabbard and he brandished it at Mandri. 
He said, “Cuhm an get dem feengahs cut.”
Mandri stepped back and waved his hands in clear submission. He said, “I’m here because Pell sent me.”
“Pell sent you?” the Jeketian demon asked.
Mandri nodded.
“What’s your name?”
“Mandrameen.”
The Iskabati demon grunted and the Jeketian slouched back against the gate. Evidently, they had been expecting him.
The Iskabati waved his sword and said, “Poop thuh lil’ hippy.”
“What?”
“Drop the knife,” said the Jeketian.
“Why?”
“Are you dumb? You’re not getting inside with a knife.”
It seemed unwise to give up the knife. If Mandri handed it over and passed through the gate he’d be ambling into the clutches of a Salavan without the means to defend himself.
Probably, he would die. 
But what good was a Mandri wielded knife against a demon king?
He’d die with or without it.
He could run away.
But where would he go? He would probably die in a gutter within a week.
If there were alternative options, Mandri couldn’t see them because burgeonsight has a rooting effect, it roots a person into the present, makes it hard to see into the future. There were an infinite number of possible paths his life’s direction could take, and presumably some of these didn’t lead to a quick death. Burgeonsight narrowed it down to just one—go through the gate.
Some people say that this is why burgeons are bad for a person’s Spark. They say that burgeons make people ignorant of the future and so they don’t plan for it, and the next thing that happens is a ruined life. Mandri would argue that everyone walks through life’s infinite possibilities with their eyes set on a narrow array of options, so if sober people are ignoring an effective infinity, what’s the harm in taking a burgeon to ignore a couple more? At least he wasn’t trying to build walls, those literal embodiments of the restriction of possibility. What’s worse than burgeons is building a wall and funneling only the ‘good’ things through the gate. These people are higher on fear than Mandri had ever been on burgeons.
He dropped the knife.
The Hrkan demon opened the gate’s cutout door and motioned Mandri in.
The door clanged behind him, and a shiver ran through his spine.
It’s amazing how fast he could come to regret a decision.</Text>

            <Text>“Faster!” Elrahet cried. She twisted in her perch atop Ayram’s shoulders to glare at all who lagged behind. Mandri struggled to keep up. The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a canyon valley but Ayram’s pace was furious. The giant scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree, and to Mandri’s unworked hands and feet it might as well have been a wall of thorns. Moto had to push him up, and Moteah had to pull him when he neared the top.
From there, they jogged along a shelf of sturdy rock which ran parallel to the road below until they came to a wall of reddish stone split by a narrow crack. The crack’s opening was hardly an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders, but somehow Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
 Mandri’s arms and legs bumped and scraped against the crack’s striated walls. If he wasn’t racked with exhaustion and fear he might have savored the scene, for shades of red rock stacked on top each other to compose dramatic sweeping forms. This beauty towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky, where the sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he ran along. Such was the height and swerve of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mush of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
 The way twisted and bent, right and left, and soon Mandri was so far behind that he rarely caught a glimpse of Moteah’s beige robe, much less anyone else beyond her. He was chasing the sounds of their paddling feet. Then he came to a fork in the road, and didn’t know which way to take, for the Ayramun had charged ahead without sparing care for him or Obo.
Before he could get too panicked, a packless, Elrahetless Ayram came sprinting back from the leftmost way.
“Keep going!” Ayram growled as he charged towards Mandri. It seemed as if the giant was about to tackle him, but Ayram stuck his iron spear into the sand and vaulted right over Mandri’s head.
 The giant landed as soft as rain. He shouted back, “Keep going!”, and he disappeared behind a bend. Mandri obeyed, he kept to the left and ran. He ran on and on without catching sight of anyone. Soon a whole hand had passed, measured out by the oppressive eye of the sun as it crossed the thin river of blue above. Mandri’s sprint slowed to a half-hearted jog. Unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off his skin the moment it beaded up. His lower back was achy and soggy and constantly scratched by Obo’s bouncing litter. The vortex of steamy air that emerged there in that gap was a weather system unto itself, good for nothing but distracting Mandri from thinking about his impending doom.
He marched at the quickest pace he could muster, and when this slowed to a walk he found himself searching the shadows for camouflaged demons that might leap out to snap at his leg.
He remembered the burgeon he’d stolen from Seb. If his eyes couldn’t see the demons that he felt must be near, then the God’s Eye sight might reveal them. He patted the burgeon bulb inside his robe to make sure it was still there, and just as he was about to spit its juice, he heard a shout for his name up ahead. He started running again.
The way belled out into a short stripe of rock-rubble valley. It was a miniature valley of sorts, as it was only there because a great length of the rock on either side had collapsed. The valley’s belly was clogged by a mound of rock, though enough of this mound had been cleared away to make a thin, passable trail. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope, was the Goree’s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision. Above that plateau was the blazing, latter-day sun. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were the Ayramun. They were arguing about something, and as Mandri approached he heard Moto say, “…and no backtalk. And that goes for you too, Seb. You been getting uppity these days and it’s time to stop.”
Seb soured at this sudden turn. “I don’t give lip, I give suggestions.”
“No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
Mandri joined their huddle and asked, “What’s going on?”
“I’m in charge,” said Moto firmly.
“Where’s Ayram?”
“The Riga stole Obo’s pseudospark, so he’s going to steal the Riga.”
“All by himself?”
“Not like any of us can keep up with him. No, what we got to do is divvy up Ayram’s stuff and keep running in case of Hrks.”
Ayram’s great pack was lying on the ground. The shadow it cast was almost as long as the shadow of the boulder Mandri was hiding in. Mandri let loose an exhausted groan and said, “I can’t carry any of that.”
Moto stared squarely at Mandri and said, stressing the threat of punishment, “You’ll do what I tell you to do.”
Mandri shrank back and raised his hands to surrender.
Moteah laughed.
“You got something to say?” Moto snapped at his sister.
“Come on,” said Moteah. “Look at him. He’s a twig, he can hardly carry himself and Obo.”
Moto’s jaw tightened. He stood up straighter. His nose flared as he sniffed that elevated air of authority. He pointed a finger at Moteah and declared, “Then you will carry his share.”
Moteah scoffed and got right up into Moto’s face. “How about, for once, you take up the weight when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a slapback lizard unfurling its frills he rolled his shoulders back to puff his chest. The siblings might have come to blows if a wad of borcandi juice didn’t go flying right between them.
“I’ll carry it,” Seb grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop bitchin’ and we can get on with it, I’ll carry the damn thing.”
“There’s no room in your pack,” said Moto.
“Sol’s sake, lash it to my spine then.”
Seb unshouldered her pack and dropped it at Moto’s feet. Moto kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he gathered some of Ayram’s gear and stuffed what he could into Seb’s pack.
Seb bore her new burden with the stolidity of an ox as she charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though her springy step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the added weight.
Elrahet followed after her, and after gathering some of Ayram’s things for herself, Moteah followed too, being sure to brush by her brother with a smirk.
Moto tossed a few blankets and the heavier ropes onto a nearby rock, as they weren’t needed. He then pointed after the others and said to Mandri, “Get going.”
Day progressed, the canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky dimmed into deeper hues. It wasn’t until the sun began to set when their path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau.
There, Mandri was greeted with a sight which crowded out all concerns—Hrks, Rigas, Amalgametes, demonry, his own exhaustion—for there in front of him was an enormous structure, at once a building and a mountain, at once a flat-topped chunk of natural stone looming into the sky and a richly ornamented temple, the walls of which were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes—circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles all joined together to roughly resemble faces. There were animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the nose of a snarling demon. It was patterns inside of patterns, lines inside of lines, and Mandri had to crane his neck to look up at it.
Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this temple should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered serve well to heighten the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crowns, and that’s even after accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays painted the stone with flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they’d have a much easier time of it because the building was a hollow husk. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arches, each as empty of candlelight as the next. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a female. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
“Looks like Seb was wrong,” Moteah whistled. “Shulgi is empty.”
“Seb is always wrong,” Moto sighed as he jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramun file. He guided them up the well-trodden slope to the foot of a long flight of stairs which led up to the temple entrance. These were troublesome stairs, and there were at least a hundred of them. They were steep, and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms for each step had its own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.
Three steps up and Mandri noticed a dark stain climbing up the stairs with him as he went. He guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be any number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement—a temple that large had to have drainage somewhere, though yes, it would be odd that they’d have it running out the front door. 
But he knew it was blood. 
Because of course it was blood.
There were demons about and there weren’t any people where people were expected to be.
It had to be blood. Blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under skin, it explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple’s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. Then his eyes alighted on the temple entrance, which itself had been sculpted in that curvilinear language into the head of a viper. Its fangs were similarly stained by that dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the building itself had eaten the Greskalun. 
They crossed the pillared court at a decent clip. Moto drew his sword as if to do battle with the building itself. He stopped before crossing the threshold. He peered inside, then drew away and said, “We’ll wait for Ayram somewhere else.”
Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion, “I’m not going back down,” she said. “I climbed up these steps and I’ll be damned if I don’t stick my head in and see what’s happened.”
“No,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram said that we should only wait inside if it was empty.”
“Someone get a torch going,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moteah was a step ahead of her, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks that Seb was holding. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.
Moto yanked the torch out of his sister’s hands.
“Ayram put me in charge,” he said.
Elrahet sneered. “Take charge of your wits and march yourself inside.”
Moto stewed in a wordless anger. He took a moment and a long-sipped breath to compose himself, and he thrust the torch into the temple interior. 
As soon he did, a swarm of bats screeched in the darkness and took flight. Their wingbeats battered the torch smoke as they swirled out of the viper’s mouth, and they swerved along the temple wall before disappearing into some unseen hole.
Moto had to start all over with his composure. When he was ready, he leaned into the temple entrance and sniffed the air. His face immediately soured.
“It smells horrible.”
Moteah agreed. “It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“You would know.”
“Get a move on,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone filtered in behind.
Shulgi’s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a barge, thrice as long, and at least four times Mandri’s height. The torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that was filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had swept some of this ash around the room, with trails of it sprinkling the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing the Ayramun, was a man sitting cross-legged.
Moto halted his people with a loud, “Hip!”, and he waved his torch back and forth.
The man did not move.
Moto shouted, “Hello!”, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.
The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was his black, ash splattered hair.
“Probably dead,” marked Seb.
“Oh, you think so?” said Moto.
“You said ‘hello’ to it.”
Elrahet held out her hand towards Moto and made a grasping motion, requesting the torch. Moto handed it over, and with its light leading the way, she hobbled towards the mysterious figure. They all followed close behind.
“He must’ve been eating mice,” said Moto as he kicked a small spine that was lying on the floor.
“Or bats,” said Seb.
Now that Mandri knew that bones were there, he was seeing them everywhere, the scattered remains of small creatures littered the floor—thin boned lizard legs, bats, perhaps foxes, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. 
Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that cross-legged figure and poked him hard with her cane.
The man fell onto his side. His impact kicked up a cloud of ash.
“He is indeed dead,” Elrahet declared. “And he is not a man, or I should say, not wholly a man. His stomach is changed.”
She bent down and rubbed the dead man’s robe between her fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “This is the raiment of Greskal’s prince.”
Moteah then asked what Mandri was thinking, “Was he the Amalgamete?”
“An Amalgamete? Yes…The Amalgamete? No.”
Elrahet’s willingness to walk so far into the room gave Mandri the courage to join her. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be ‘inside’—that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so many days wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were dead critters and a dead body? So what if there were demons lurking in the shadows? It felt good to flout these ominous things. If he didn’t, he’d probably faint.
As he crept towards the fire-pit, he noticed a faint golden glimmer at the back of the room. He walked past Elrahet and the body, towards that glimmer, for shining faintly in the torch’s dancing light was an enormous golden statue of Solraheen sitting at the back of the hall.
As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a rare Old Jandri piece where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling—a form outlawed by Hrk, for it was sacrilegious to suggest that Solraheen’s principles did not dwell in Jeket. Here, His golden skin was smooth and His body featureless. His face was round, alive, and enlightened. His pose was rigid as a board, as if someone who had never sat before had the act described to them by blind man. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned in their sculptures, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to reality. It was more primitive, and therefore, more true. And it was huge, at least ten feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.
It was a beautiful sight. A source of serenity. None of it glittered as brightly as Mandrameen might have wanted, for a thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash had speckled His cheek. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. But what could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen’s golden skin was darkly mottled. It was tarnished.
Mandri winced at such impiety. Pure gold cannot tarnish, and so this meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals. No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their suffering. And worse, standing by Solraheen’s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine.
Now, he could not say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which couldn’t be ignored. Surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.
One indignity to wash away another.
“They should have settled for a smaller statue,” Mandri mumbled.
“What’s that?” croaked Elrahet.
Mandri pointed to the statue. “It’s tarnished,” he said.
“What of it?”
“It’s not pure gold.”
Elrahet tissked at Mandri’s charge and winced as if it wounded her.
“Solraheen cares not for gold,” she said sharply. “What He cares about is this man,” she poked the dead man again with her cane, “And that poor thing there.” She pointed with the torch towards a dark lump on the floor. It wasn’t but ten feet away from Mandri. 
It had a mop of dark hair.
It had a human ear.
It had a neck, and attached to this neck were a few links of white spine. What flesh there was looked like it had been gnawed.
Mandri scuffled away from this severed head, and crept back towards the Ayramun.
“The Mazid was right,” said Elrahet said. “Though it wasn’t hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.”
Moto was standing over the green robed body. “Are you saying that this man ate that other man over there?” 
Elrahet nodded. “It was his final meal.”
“Ok, we’re leaving,” said Moto.
“No,” said Elrahet. “The struggle in this room is over.”
“We should burn it. That’s what we came here to do!”
Elrahet shook her head. “Don’t be so quick to judge those touched by the darkness, for there is no greater struggle. This was one of Solraheen’s champions. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it transformed him completely. See here—”
She held the torch low to the firepit. She poked around with her cane to reveal, half buried in ash, a large round stomach. Evidently the green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it the intestines behind, and these he’d cut as well and tossed into the ash. 
“If he had lost his battle, this world’s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand.”
The stomach was black, nearly as black as Fabled Black, and while that might be expected for flesh cooked in flames, it seemed to Mandri that the organ was blackened by evil.
Moteah asked, “Was he responsible for the pilgrims in the Pass?”
“Perhaps,” said Elrahet. She then pulled out her golden knife and cut the stomach open without effort. She used her cane to spread the halves apart, and she leaned over it as if to divine it.
Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ is subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance—there’s the stomach’s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the meaning of current and past events but predict the future. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach, that he would understand anything about what was going on, but after a half a finger of silent staring, the stomach squirmed and burped up a black puff of smoke that struck Mandri dumb with dread.
It didn’t take a witch to interpret this sign.
Evil was here.
Death was coming.
“Aaaaallllright,” said Moto, his voice uneven. “We’re leaving now!”
Elrahet ignored him and continued to sort through the stomach’s putrid contents with her blade, and her face grew more sullen with every poke. 
Moteah watched as if she could read it too. “He couldn’t be the Amalgamete we’ve been hunting.”
“Did you people not hear me?” Moto asked, unable to comprehend why no one would listen to him. “I said we’re waiting outside.”
“Wait outside? For what?”
“For Ayram!”
Moto turned to leave, but as he did, a black shadow scurried through Shulgi’s threshold. He yelped and jumped back, and good thing he did, for standing there, framed by the doorway, was a demon roach the size of a dog.
It had an oily-black shell and human hands sprouting out the ends of its segmented legs. Its face was an unholy mix between an insect’s and a man’s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling. Its mouth gulped the air like fish out of water.
“Get back!” Elrahet shouted, but Moto and Moteah were already on their way, swords drawn. Mandri retreated all the way back to the statue of Solraheen. He would have climbed up onto Solraheen’s lap if he didn’t consider it to be sacrilege.
“It’s only a hag-beetle,” Elrahet said as the creature climbed up onto the wall. “It does have a spine inside its shell which can kill—careful when it opens.”
Both Moto and Moteah did not look eager to engage. Mandri clung to Solraheen’s foot.
Elrahet pointed to the demon and shouted, “Stiffen up and kill it!” She sneered at Moto’s shoulder rolling gutlessness. She was about to hit him with her cane when ten more hag-beetles scurried in from outside.
“What now!?” Moto shouted as he aimed his sword at the lead beetle advancing along the wall.
Elrahet said simply, “Run.”
Fear rooted to Solraheen’s side as Seb and Elrahet rushed by and fled into a hall nearby. Moto grabbed Mandri’s robe by the collar and yanked him along. Mandri didn’t find his feet until he got over the thought of Elrahet’s incompetence—if she could see the future, she should have been able to see a swarm of demons trapping them in this temple. Either she couldn’t see very far, or she’d led them here on purpose.</Text>

            <Title>PIle of Dead scratch</Title>
            <Text>The only thing Mandri took for himself was a pair of leather pouches tied together by a stiff gut cord—it was Tob’s collection of rocks, one sack filled with luck, the other filled with bad luck, maybe ten pebbles apiece. Mandri had plucked them out of the dead man’s robes because those rocks were Tob’s life’s work and Mandri respected the effort. He half-believed the rocks were charmed, because if a person can be lucky then why not a rock? And the pouches were more than just the rocks inside them. They were the kind of thing Frumule might paint to get her message across. She might have put them hanging off the hip of a foreground figure to let everyone know this particular man was manlier than the rest. Mandri dangled them about and wondered why he never noticed this kind of thing unless it was in a painting. In life, pouches were merely pouches—in a painting they’re a token of testicular virility. Tob had been walking around with these pouches for who knows how long and not once did Mandri point and laugh.

Mandri looked down in his lap and pulled one of the lucky stones out. It was quite striking, for a stone, for it was two completely different stones, one half beige, the other chalk-white, which had somehow fused together to become one.

pulled a shimmering, red smoke out from her throat. This smoke wisped and curled like smoke from a candle’s flame, and it followed the direction of her words as if buffeted by them, and it settled around the tip of her golden blade. 

Mandri winced when Ayram barked the name with a force that could shake loose a star.
“PURL!”
A heartbeat later, and Purl came running into the clearing, yelling, “What is it?” She took one look at Elrahet hovering over Obo and understood.

Purl, still kneeling, recomposed herself. She waited until Obo’s eyes were alert and staring back at her, and then she issued a tight-lipped command.
“Hiss,” she said, “Like a lizard.”
Obo smiled, and simply said the word, “Hiss.”
“Did you make him do that?” Ayram asked Purl with a skeptical eye.
“I think so.”
 He asked Obo.“Did she make you do that?”
“I am not sure how to answer that.”
“Answer with the truth.”
“The truth is that if the girl didn’t tell me to hiss like a lizard, I never would have said hiss.”
Elrahet grumbled again. “We don’t have time for this.”
“Speak plainly,” Ayram demanded.
Obo shrugged and said, “The girl’s command was not sufficient cause to compel me to speak.”
Ayram turned again to Purl, frustration tilting his voice. “Make it do something by thinking it.”
Mandri watched with bated breath as Purl whistled out her own through pursed lips. She could, at least, compose herself under pressure. She drew upon her unseen strength, and she dipped into some altered state, eyes rolling back, lips mumbling, and suddenly there was a north-easterly breeze which was not there before.
She reached out with her handless arm again. Her nose wrinkled and Obo’s bald head twitched. When Purl’s glare went wild, Obo’s shoulders crimped and a faint golden glow began to shine through the skin of his throat. He opened his mouth towards the heavens, and Mandri expected to see a blast of Mazidfire issue forth—everyone did—but nothing came. Soon the wind was dead and Purl was back inside her own skin with nothing to show for it.
“Interesting,” said Obo, impressed. “You almost did it.”
“That’s good enough for now,” said Ayram.
“Is it?” Obo asked.
“It is.”

“They breed them selfish, don’t they?”
“Wanting a Spark is selfish?”
Ayram chuckled and then paused to give Obo’s suggestion some consideration. He said, “I don’t even know if it’s possible.”
“What about Mandri?” Obo asked. “I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into his body. I did not believe such a thing was possible, yet here he is. If you could infuse Mandri’s corpse with a Spark which was not his own, then do the same for me.”
Ayram eyed Elrahet and asked, “Can this be done?”
Elrahet was standing as still as scarecrow, staring at Obo, her old joints seemingly stuck as the layers of black tatters draped on her leathery bones drifted against the breeze. She said, “A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require an act of creation.”
Ayram shrugged and mused, “If it can’t be done.”
Elrahet growled, and her hand twisted tight on her cane as she said, “I did not say it could not be done.”
Mandri’s ears pricked up, and the old witch seemed to grow a foot in his eyes as she waddled over to Obo and loomed over his diminutive form

            <Title>Shulgi</Title>
            <Text>“Faster!” Elrahet cried. She twisted in her perch atop Ayram’s shoulders to glare at all who lagged behind. Mandri struggled to keep up. The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a canyon valley but Ayram’s pace was furious. The giant scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree, and to Mandri’s unworked hands and feet it might as well have been a wall of thorns. Moto had to push him up, and Moteah had to pull him when he neared the top.
From there, they jogged along a shelf of sturdy rock which ran parallel to the road below until they came to a wall of reddish stone split by a narrow crack. The crack’s opening was hardly an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders, but somehow Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
 Mandri’s arms and legs bumped and scraped against the crack’s striated walls. If he wasn’t racked with exhaustion and fear he might have savored the scene, for shades of red rock stacked on top each other to compose dramatic sweeping forms. This beauty towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky, where the sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he ran along. Such was the height and swerve of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mush of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
 The way twisted and bent, right and left, and soon Mandri was so far behind that he rarely caught a glimpse of Moteah’s beige robe, much less anyone else beyond her. He was chasing the sounds of their paddling feet. Then he came to a fork in the road, and didn’t know which way to take, for the Ayramun had charged ahead without sparing care for him or Obo.
Before he could get too panicked, a packless, Elrahetless Ayram came sprinting back from the leftmost way.
“Keep going!” Ayram growled as he charged towards Mandri. It seemed as if the giant was about to tackle him, but Ayram stuck his iron spear into the sand and vaulted right over Mandri’s head.
 The giant landed as soft as rain. He shouted back, “Keep going!”, and he disappeared behind a bend. Mandri obeyed, he kept to the left and ran. He ran on and on without catching sight of anyone. Soon a whole hand had passed, measured out by the oppressive eye of the sun as it crossed the thin river of blue above. Mandri’s sprint slowed to a half-hearted jog. Unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off his skin the moment it beaded up. His lower back was achy and soggy and constantly scratched by Obo’s bouncing litter. The vortex of steamy air that emerged there in that gap was a weather system unto itself, good for nothing but distracting Mandri from thinking about his impending doom.
He marched at the quickest pace he could muster, and when this slowed to a walk he found himself searching the shadows for camouflaged demons that might leap out to snap at his leg.
He remembered the burgeon he’d stolen from Seb. If his eyes couldn’t see the demons that he felt must be near, then the God’s Eye sight might reveal them. He patted the burgeon bulb inside his robe to make sure it was still there, and just as he was about to spit its juice, he heard a shout for his name up ahead. He started running again.
The way belled out into a short stripe of rock-rubble valley. It was a miniature valley of sorts, as it was only there because a great length of the rock on either side had collapsed. The valley’s belly was clogged by a mound of rock, though enough of this mound had been cleared away to make a thin, passable trail. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope, was the Goree’s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision. Above that plateau was the blazing, latter-day sun. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were the Ayramun. They were arguing about something, and as Mandri approached he heard Moto say, “…and no backtalk. And that goes for you too, Seb. You been getting uppity these days and it’s time to stop.”
Seb soured at this sudden turn. “I don’t give lip, I give suggestions.”
“No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
Mandri joined their huddle and asked, “What’s going on?”
“I’m in charge,” said Moto firmly.
“Where’s Ayram?”
“The Riga stole Obo’s pseudospark, so he’s going to steal the Riga.”
“All by himself?”
“Not like any of us can keep up with him. No, what we got to do is divvy up Ayram’s stuff and keep running in case of Hrks.”
Ayram’s great pack was lying on the ground. The shadow it cast was almost as long as the shadow of the boulder Mandri was hiding in. Mandri let loose an exhausted groan and said, “I can’t carry any of that.”
Moto stared squarely at Mandri and said, stressing the threat of punishment, “You’ll do what I tell you to do.”
Mandri shrank back and raised his hands to surrender.
Moteah laughed.
“You got something to say?” Moto snapped at his sister.
“Come on,” said Moteah. “Look at him. He’s a twig, he can hardly carry himself and Obo.”
Moto’s jaw tightened. He stood up straighter. His nose flared as he sniffed that elevated air of authority. He pointed a finger at Moteah and declared, “Then you will carry his share.”
Moteah scoffed and got right up into Moto’s face. “How about, for once, you take up the weight when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a slapback lizard unfurling its frills he rolled his shoulders back to puff his chest. The siblings might have come to blows if a wad of borcandi juice didn’t go flying right between them.
“I’ll carry it,” Seb grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop bitchin’ and we can get on with it, I’ll carry the damn thing.”
“There’s no room in your pack,” said Moto.
“Sol’s sake, lash it to my spine then.”
Seb unshouldered her pack and dropped it at Moto’s feet. Moto kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he gathered some of Ayram’s gear and stuffed what he could into Seb’s pack.
Seb bore her new burden with the stolidity of an ox as she charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though her springy step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the added weight.
Elrahet followed after her, and after gathering some of Ayram’s things for herself, Moteah followed too, being sure to brush by her brother with a smirk.
Moto tossed a few blankets and the heavier ropes onto a nearby rock, as they weren’t needed. He then pointed after the others and said to Mandri, “Get going.”
Day progressed, the canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky dimmed into deeper hues. It wasn’t until the sun began to set when their path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau.
There, Mandri was greeted with a sight which crowded out all concerns—Hrks, Rigas, Amalgametes, demonry, his own exhaustion—for there in front of him was an enormous structure, at once a building and a mountain, at once a flat-topped chunk of natural stone looming into the sky and a richly ornamented temple, the walls of which were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes—circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles all joined together to roughly resemble faces. There were animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the nose of a snarling demon. It was patterns inside of patterns, lines inside of lines, and Mandri had to crane his neck to look up at it.
Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this temple should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered serve well to heighten the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crowns, and that’s even after accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays painted the stone with flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they’d have a much easier time of it because the building was a hollow husk. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arches, each as empty of candlelight as the next. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a female. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
“Looks like Seb was wrong,” Moteah whistled. “Shulgi is empty.”
“Seb is always wrong,” Moto sighed as he jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramun file. He guided them up the well-trodden slope to the foot of a long flight of stairs which led up to the temple entrance. These were troublesome stairs, and there were at least a hundred of them. They were steep, and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms for each step had its own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.
Three steps up and Mandri noticed a dark stain climbing up the stairs with him as he went. He guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be any number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement—a temple that large had to have drainage somewhere, though yes, it would be odd that they’d have it running out the front door. 
But he knew it was blood. 
Because of course it was blood.
There were demons about and there weren’t any people where people were expected to be.
It had to be blood. Blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under skin, it explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple’s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. Then his eyes alighted on the temple entrance, which itself had been sculpted in that curvilinear language into the head of a viper. Its fangs were similarly stained by that dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the building itself had eaten the Greskalun. 
They crossed the pillared court at a decent clip. Moto drew his sword as if to do battle with the building itself. He stopped before crossing the threshold. He peered inside, then drew away and said, “We’ll wait for Ayram somewhere else.”
Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion, “I’m not going back down,” she said. “I climbed up these steps and I’ll be damned if I don’t stick my head in and see what’s happened.”
“No,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram said that we should only wait inside if it was empty.”
“Someone get a torch going,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moteah was a step ahead of her, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks that Seb was holding. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.
Moto yanked the torch out of his sister’s hands.
“Ayram put me in charge,” he said.
Elrahet sneered. “Take charge of your wits and march yourself inside.”
Moto stewed in a wordless anger. He took a moment and a long-sipped breath to compose himself, and he thrust the torch into the temple interior. 
As soon he did, a swarm of bats screeched in the darkness and took flight. Their wingbeats battered the torch smoke as they swirled out of the viper’s mouth, and they swerved along the temple wall before disappearing into some unseen hole.
Moto had to start all over with his composure. When he was ready, he leaned into the temple entrance and sniffed the air. His face immediately soured.
“It smells horrible.”
Moteah agreed. “It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“You would know.”
“Get a move on,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone filtered in behind.
Shulgi’s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a barge, thrice as long, and at least four times Mandri’s height. The torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that was filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had swept some of this ash around the room, with trails of it sprinkling the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing the Ayramun, was a man sitting cross-legged.
Moto halted his people with a loud, “Hip!”, and he waved his torch back and forth.
The man did not move.
Moto shouted, “Hello!”, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.
The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was his black, ash splattered hair.
“Probably dead,” marked Seb.
“Oh, you think so?” said Moto.
“You said ‘hello’ to it.”
Elrahet held out her hand towards Moto and made a grasping motion, requesting the torch. Moto handed it over, and with its light leading the way, she hobbled towards the mysterious figure. They all followed close behind.
“He must’ve been eating mice,” said Moto as he kicked a small spine that was lying on the floor.
“Or bats,” said Seb.
Now that Mandri knew that bones were there, he was seeing them everywhere, the scattered remains of small creatures littered the floor—thin boned lizard legs, bats, perhaps foxes, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. 
Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that cross-legged figure and poked him hard with her cane.
The man fell onto his side. His impact kicked up a cloud of ash.
“He is indeed dead,” Elrahet declared. “And he is not a man, or I should say, not wholly a man. His stomach is changed.”
She bent down and rubbed the dead man’s robe between her fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “This is the raiment of Greskal’s prince.”
Moteah then asked what Mandri was thinking, “Was he the Amalgamete?”
“An Amalgamete? Yes…The Amalgamete? No.”
Elrahet’s willingness to walk so far into the room gave Mandri the courage to join her. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be ‘inside’—that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so many days wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were dead critters and a dead body? So what if there were demons lurking in the shadows? It felt good to flout these ominous things. If he didn’t, he’d probably faint.
As he crept towards the fire-pit, he noticed a faint golden glimmer at the back of the room. He walked past Elrahet and the body, towards that glimmer, for shining faintly in the torch’s dancing light was an enormous golden statue of Solraheen sitting at the back of the hall.
As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a rare Old Jandri piece where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling—a form outlawed by Hrk, for it was sacrilegious to suggest that Solraheen’s principles did not dwell in Jeket. Here, His golden skin was smooth and His body featureless. His face was round, alive, and enlightened. His pose was rigid as a board, as if someone who had never sat before had the act described to them by blind man. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned in their sculptures, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to reality. It was more primitive, and therefore, more true. And it was huge, at least ten feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.
It was a beautiful sight. A source of serenity. None of it glittered as brightly as Mandrameen might have wanted, for a thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash had speckled His cheek. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. But what could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen’s golden skin was darkly mottled. It was tarnished.
Mandri winced at such impiety. Pure gold cannot tarnish, and so this meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals. No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their suffering. And worse, standing by Solraheen’s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine.
Now, he could not say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which couldn’t be ignored. Surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.
One indignity to wash away another.
“They should have settled for a smaller statue,” Mandri mumbled.
“What’s that?” croaked Elrahet.
Mandri pointed to the statue. “It’s tarnished,” he said.
“What of it?”
“It’s not pure gold.”
Elrahet tissked at Mandri’s charge and winced as if it wounded her.
“Solraheen cares not for gold,” she said sharply. “What He cares about is this man,” she poked the dead man again with her cane, “And that poor thing there.” She pointed with the torch towards a dark lump on the floor. It wasn’t but ten feet away from Mandri. 
It had a mop of dark hair.
It had a human ear.
It had a neck, and attached to this neck were a few links of white spine. What flesh there was looked like it had been gnawed.
Mandri scuffled away from this severed head, and crept back towards the Ayramun.
“The Mazid was right,” said Elrahet said. “Though it wasn’t hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.”
Moto was standing over the green robed body. “Are you saying that this man ate that other man over there?” 
Elrahet nodded. “It was his final meal.”
“Ok, we’re leaving,” said Moto.
“No,” said Elrahet. “The struggle in this room is over.”
“We should burn it. That’s what we came here to do!”
Elrahet shook her head. “Don’t be so quick to judge those touched by the darkness, for there is no greater struggle. This was one of Solraheen’s champions. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it transformed him completely. See here—”
She held the torch low to the firepit. She poked around with her cane to reveal, half buried in ash, a large round stomach. Evidently the green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it the intestines behind, and these he’d cut as well and tossed into the ash. 
“If he had lost his battle, this world’s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand.”
The stomach was black, nearly as black as Fabled Black, and while that might be expected for flesh cooked in flames, it seemed to Mandri that the organ was blackened by evil.
Moteah asked, “Was he responsible for the pilgrims in the Pass?”
“Perhaps,” said Elrahet. She then pulled out her golden knife and cut the stomach open without effort. She used her cane to spread the halves apart, and she leaned over it as if to divine it.
Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ is subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance—there’s the stomach’s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the meaning of current and past events but predict the future. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach, that he would understand anything about what was going on, but after a half a finger of silent staring, the stomach squirmed and burped up a black puff of smoke that struck Mandri dumb with dread.
It didn’t take a witch to interpret this sign.
Evil was here.
Death was coming.
“Aaaaallllright,” said Moto, his voice uneven. “We’re leaving now!”
Elrahet ignored him and continued to sort through the stomach’s putrid contents with her blade, and her face grew more sullen with every poke. 
Moteah watched as if she could read it too. “He couldn’t be the Amalgamete we’ve been hunting.”
“Did you people not hear me?” Moto asked, unable to comprehend why no one would listen to him. “I said we’re waiting outside.”
“Wait outside? For what?”
“For Ayram!”
Moto turned to leave, but as he did, a black shadow scurried through Shulgi’s threshold. He yelped and jumped back, and good thing he did, for standing there, framed by the doorway, was a demon roach the size of a dog.
It had an oily-black shell and human hands sprouting out the ends of its segmented legs. Its face was an unholy mix between an insect’s and a man’s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling. Its mouth gulped the air like fish out of water.
“Get back!” Elrahet shouted, but Moto and Moteah were already on their way, swords drawn. Mandri retreated all the way back to the statue of Solraheen. He would have climbed up onto Solraheen’s lap if he didn’t consider it to be sacrilege.
“It’s only a hag-beetle,” Elrahet said as the creature climbed up onto the wall. “It does have a spine inside its shell which can kill—careful when it opens.”
Both Moto and Moteah did not look eager to engage. Mandri clung to Solraheen’s foot.
Elrahet pointed to the demon and shouted, “Stiffen up and kill it!” She sneered at Moto’s shoulder rolling gutlessness. She was about to hit him with her cane when ten more hag-beetles scurried in from outside.
“What now!?” Moto shouted as he aimed his sword at the lead beetle advancing along the wall.
Elrahet said simply, “Run.”
Fear rooted to Solraheen’s side as Seb and Elrahet rushed by and fled into a hall nearby. Moto grabbed Mandri’s robe by the collar and yanked him along. Mandri didn’t find his feet until he got over the thought of Elrahet’s incompetence—if she could see the future, she should have been able to see a swarm of demons trapping them in this temple. Either she couldn’t see very far, or she’d led them here on purpose.</Text>

            <Title>Elrahet's Story</Title>
            <Text>The God’s Eye burgeon weighed heavily in Mandri’s pocket. It was there and it was always there. And he couldn’t think about anything else. Perhaps the witch was the cause of his fixation. The God’s Eye sight had revealed a world tied together by threads of purpose, and it had shown how Elrahet could cut these threads that bound him to everything else.
He was tethered now only to Obo.
And perhaps the burgeon, too.
He wouldn’t mind being untethered to everything else, but that should be his choice, not anyone else’s. Waste away on a farm outside of Meskalim? That was his choice. This was too much. Elrahet had simply done what she wanted to do, like she was some well-adjusted person. Like Moto.
Elrahet was another thing he couldn’t stop thinking about. What he’d seen of Elrahet, under the influence of the God’s Eye burgeon, was indescribable. More than even Ayram, she was shrouded in blinding purpose.
As Mandri walked he began to suspect that his inability to think about anything else was due to the act of walking itself. Something about forward locomotion prevented lateral thinking. It explained why outland pokes seemed dumber than everyone else—too much walking. But it didn’t explain why he could talk about anything while walking, and talking was much the same as thinking. And it didn’t explain Obo, who wasn’t walking, and yet he was thinking about all the same things. When he shifted around around in his litter and asked a question, well of course, it was about Elrahet.
“What do you make of the witch?” he asked.
The question left Mandri speechless, and Obo asked again, “I said what do you make of the witch?”
“How did you know I was thinking about her?”
“I didn’t.”
Mandri doubted it. Obo was too attuned to Mandri’s moods for it to be mere coincidence.
Mandri said, “The witch is…she’s…do you know what I saw?”
“You mentioned it only briefly.”
“I saw white threads. Like spider threads, only they shimmered with brilliant color.”
“You said the witch could see them too?”
“She could see them and cut them. Each time she did, I changed. I can’t explain it, but… I think she was changing the future.”
“Isn’t that what we’re all trying to do?”
“Sure, but I mean, she could see the future, and change it.”
“I think we should ask the Ayramun about it.”
“What!? No. Absolutely not.”
“Mandri, something is going on which is clearly much deeper than what is going on.”
“Yeah, but that doesn’t mean we have to—”
“Let’s ask Moto.”
“Let’s not.”
Obo shouted, “Hey, Moto!” 
Moto was walking not ten yards in front. “What do you want?” he called back without turning to look.
Mandri whispered, “Obo, don’t,” but Obo ignored him, and called out again, “Could you come here, please?”
“What do you want?”
“We want to know what kind of witch Elrahet is.”
Moto suddenly stopped, and when he turned around, he did so slowly, deliberately, as if he’d been waiting for days to be asked this very question. “Who’s asking?” he asked. “You or Mandri?”
Mandri said, “Both of us.”
Moto looked over his shoulder towards Elrahet, who was some distance ahead, trailing Ayram. He cupped his voice and called out, “El!”
The old witch turned in her tracks and stared back. Her face was lost in the shadow of her cowl.
“The boy wants to know!” he called.
The old witch drew an arc in the air with her walking cane, then continued on marching.
 Moto said, “That means she’ll tell you at night’s rest.” He turned back to the trail.
The much anticipated night rest came quickly. Mandri helped build the fire, though his role was reduced to gathering fuel, as ‘maker of the fire’ was Moto’s role, a role reserved for men. True men. Not Mandri. Evidently, Mandri wasn’t strong enough to rub sticks together. But when the fire was finished, Mandri was allowed to sit as close to the fire as he could, and Obo slid out of his litter to join him. When everyone had gathered, Moto reminded Elrahet of her promise to tell her story.
“Ask again, and I won’t tell it,” Elrahet warned as she warmed her bony knees by the fire. Moteah passed around a bag of jerked beef. Moto was gracious enough to share a skin of beer—an unprecedented courtesy which led Mandri to wonder if this was a final meal. He took a nervous sip as the night settled in. The starry sky was bright. The air was pleasant. The soft hiss of the wind sprinkled sand. There was scuffle nearby as a squeaking desert rat met its end in the jaws of something or other, probably a lizard. At this point, Mandri wondered if Elrahet had died with her eyes stuck open. Then she grumbled, “Where to begin? It is likely that the boy’s mind is too polluted to understand.” She paused and stared at the campfire’s slender flicks of flame.
“I will begin at the beginning. More might have come before the beginning, but who can say? Solraheen emerged into the Void, and it was Solraheen, the Spark, and the Void. Nothing else. How did these three come to be? None can say. No, not even the Solitants.” She looked at Mandri as she envenomed the name of that religious order. Mandri pinched off a corner of a slip of salty beef. Elrahet watched him. He felt she was waiting for him to defend the dictates of the Solitants, and so he did.
“But the Solitants say that Solraheen came from the Spark when the Spark was pierced by—”
“Take or leave my story, boy, but first it must be given.”
“She means, shut up,” said Moto.
Mandri shrugged. “Solraheen had to come from somewhere.” Everyone stared at him like he was an idiot. Everyone but Ayram. Ayram was half asleep. So Mandri said, “Sorry,” and he poked his pinch of beef into his cheek to show that he was done interrupting.
“There was Solraheen, the Spark, and the Void,” Elrahet said, re-centering her story. “There were no days back then, there were no years to measure the passing of the age. It was an eternity. Solraheen spent this time alone. A hundred million thousand years alone. When He’d had enough, He uttered the first word, and the sound of the word shattered the Spark. From the Spark’s fragments, Solraheen created a garden world. He fashioned land and sea for His enjoyment. He created all manner of creatures for His companionship. It was beautiful, yet beauty loses its charm when it stays the same, for that was what He created—Stasis. Order. Every day the same. Each new day was indistinguishable from the day before, and so His garden did not give Him pleasure. The dullness reminded him of the very thing He’d tried to escape, it reminded Him of that timeless eon shared with the Void and the Spark.
“In His boundless wisdom, He brought forth a new creation, one in which living creatures no longer merely lived, but they brought forth offspring. There were many generations, all of them different from their forebears. And He gave these living things brighter Sparks than they’d had before, such Sparks as we possess. In so doing, He condemned the living things to die, for the heat of their Sparks slowly burned and killed them. That is the purpose of death—it is the plow which turns creation over anew and gives the seedlings room to grow.
“You might judge Solraheen for condemning all living things to death, but know that death comes for the sake of a deeper, flowing beauty, beauty such as Solraheen Himself never dreamed of. And He Himself would abide by death’s principles, for He truly believed that His creation must be free of His influence, that it might grow up to define itself on its own terms. Any proud and loving parent would die that their children might live to reach beyond them, so, Solraheen laid down to die, and die He did.”
This was a heresy Mandri had never heard. He blurted out, “Solraheen killed Himself? That’s not how He died.”
Moteah smacked him on the back of his head. “Shut up!”
Mandri fished for sympathy with a pouty look, but even Obo was annoyed with his interruptions. Mandri shrank back, and Elrahet continued on.
“Solraheen laid down to die—but!—He did not fully die. Against His will, His body awakened, possessed by a different mind. This mind was none other than the mind of Schisol.”
This was a telling that went too far. There were acceptably familiar elements, yes, but the old woman’s words were baited with blasphemous knowledge. Especially tantalizing was the suggestion that Solraheen and Schisol were of the same flesh.
“Schisol awoke inhabiting Solraheen’s body knowing nothing—no knowledge of the world or even of Himself, or even of Solraheen who came before. He wandered His brother’s garden as confused as any of us. As the ages passed, Schisol’s mind matured. He felt the heat of Sparked creatures and grew sorry for them. He saw how their every breath was invisible flame, how their bodies were burning, slowly, until death. He saw their endless cycle of loneliness and pain, and He came to believe that creation was a corruption. He correctly assumed that all Sparks had been shattered from a single all-white Spark, and from this He devised a cure—loneliness and death would disappear if all Sparks were to be reunited together again in sacred communion. So, Schisol set about destroying the garden, killing all the living creatures and joining their Sparks together. It took Him a long millennia, but in the end He prevailed. The last thing to join with this all-white Spark was Himself. And so, He killed Himself, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, this time, in the possession of Solraheen.
“Solraheen awoke into the Void accompanied by the single all-white Spark. He had no memory of what had occurred while Schisol was in control of Their body. He had no memory of Schisol. He knew only that He laid down to die amongst a beautiful world and had awakened into a Void. He was confused. Seeing no other to blame for the death of His garden world, He blamed Himself, and though His grief was immeasurable, He began His creative work once more. But this time He selected a number from amongst the creatures which roamed the world and invested them with Mind, so that they could, in His absence, act as stewards of creation. These were the first humans, and they wandered the land and sailed the seas and fulfilled their duty admirably, living peaceably with each other. Solraheen was once again satisfied, and as before, He laid down to die so that His creation could come into its own. But instead of dying, His body rose again.”
“Schisol,” Moto muttered in child-like wonder.
Elrahet nodded.
“Schisol awoke into His worst nightmare, for He saw that the all-white Spark had once again been split and fragmented. Another miserable garden had blossomed, trapping all the Spark’s splinters into a never-ending cycle of suffering and despair. Amongst the lonely creatures that roamed this garden were the saddest, loneliest, most terrifying creatures imaginable—humans. 
“Schisol set out to destroy creation for a second time. To hasten this end, He explained to humanity their suffering, how it was caused by the splitting of the Spark, and He enlisted their aid in destroying the rest of creation that it might be made whole. But some humans remembered their stewardship and the teachings of Solraheen. They remembered creation’s beauty. They resisted. Schisol inflicted tortures upon them, but this pain only transformed them into beings of tremendous power—these were the first of the lesser gods. They arrayed themselves against Schisol and His minions. A cataclysmic battle took place. All the lesser gods were killed, yet Schisol, too, was slain. But He was not completely dead. His body arose again, possessed by Solraheen.
“Solraheen awoke into a land laid waste by war. He asked the struggling humans what had occurred, but He did not understand their stories, for he did not understand His own dual nature. The people claimed that He Himself had   ordered the slaughter. While some men and women were eager to fulfill this dark command, there were those who had resisted. From amongst these righteous people, Solraheen selected a girl, one whom He trusted, and He made her His Envoy that she might preach and cleanse the garden of all corruption. Solraheen made her immortal, that she might maintain a thread of purity in His eventual absence, and together, they set out to regenerate the world. But Schisol’s minions, believing that their god had betrayed them, conspired to end Him. They summoned the first Amalgamete. This creature gave birth to the foulest of demons, a dark assassin with venom spun from shadows. Solraheen was murdered, but He did not die, He arose again as Schisol.
“It was then that the truth of Their dual nature was revealed, for Solraheen’s Envoy ran to Him, thinking, of course, that she was running to Solraheen. When Schisol learned that His twin Self was responsible for creating the garden, for creating this world of suffering, His rage was boundless…those were dark days. When Schisol regained Himself, He came to believe that if He could send a message to His brother, He could make Solraheen see fit to end the senseless suffering. But as Schisol did not trust Solraheen’s Envoy to do the message justice, He raised up another young woman for Himself and gave her eternal life. He called her his Shadow, and with her, He shared His foul message, and then He ended Himself, that Solraheen might arise and learn the truth.
“But Schisol’s message was ill received by Solraheen. As you might guess, Schisol’s Envoy rallied Schisol’s minions, and they murdered Solraheen, and thereafter came a cycling which lasted another long eternity. When the evil Schisol lived, Solraheen’s blessed were martyred and their purified Sparks transformed into gods who joined together to undo Schisol’s terror. When Solraheen lived, Schisol’s minions raised armies of demons to undo Him. In a desperate attempt to finish this endless struggle, Solraheen called down a piece of the Void, what your people call Fabled Black, and it fell from the sky as a meteor and obliterated Solraheen. He did this so as to prevent Schisol from ever rising again.”
“But the fight isn’t over,” said Moto, pointing out the obvious.
“Yes,” said Elrahet. “We made a mistake. The battle still rages, for Schisol’s Shadow still lives.”
“So does Solraheen’s Envoy,” Moto smirked.
“She does?” Mandri asked, and he was about to add, ‘Who?’, when he noticed that all eyes, including Ayram’s, were fixed on Elrahet.
Mandri wanted to deny it, for no one could be so special, and if they were, they wouldn’t be breathing the same air as him. But he’d seen Elrahet in the sight of The God’s Eye burgeon. If she was immortal, if she was Solraheen’s chosen, well that had explanatory power—that fantastic raiment of light which she wore could only be explained as an accumulation of purpose as the ages wound themselves around her.
And the story explained Pel, that evil witch. She must be Schisol’s Shadow. What else could these two witchy sisters with golden knives be but priestesses for the twin brother gods.
Dead gods.
This meant Elrahet and Pel were the closest things to divinity walking the world.
Them, and the Amalgamete.

            <Title>Ambush</Title>
            <Text>Seb hated the waiting that came before an ambush. The future was coming and with it came death or glory, so it was hard not to get excited and make expectations. He dreamed of death and glory. He’d been anticipating the moment for days. His expectations were built up so high that they’d gone past giddy excitement and had hardened into a sense of impending doom, such that he felt certain he was going to die. He reminded himself that he felt that way during the last ten big ambushes, and yet he came out alive. But there were Ayramun who’d been through it twenty times and died on the twenty first. It was horrible, this feeling. Having to sit with this fear for so long made it worse to be the ambusher than the ambushee. Travelers in the Sand might be expecting to encounter some gang of hard-up outland pokes, but they expected to live through it or they never would have set out in the first place. Death comes as a surprise for them, and their dread is short lived. It wouldn’t be close to what Seb went through. Those people were lucky they died so quickly.
But maybe they weren’t lucky. It might be true that the only thing that matters is what the mind is like at the exact moment of death, because when the Spark drops out of time, who knows, those last thoughts might be crystallized for all eternity. If one’s last moment is agony then it’s agony forever. For the lucky it's a deep sleep. For folks who get ambushed in the desert, if a sharpened point of iron implants itself in the forehead and scratches the right lobes, that look of shock and surprise gets fixed on the skull and it sets hard as stone. There’s not much comfort in the fact that these terrified expressions eventually get wiped away when some gummy mouthed, flat faced lizard waddles in and chews it up, because by that point the Spark is already good and gone.
If it were true, it could happen to Seb. That was a real worry. This particular ambush was feeling more risky than most. The plan to take out the Mazid and its Minder had to play out exactly as expected, or else all the Ayramun would be killed. If a Mazid were free to run amok amongst them, they would be killed no doubt. A Mazid could wipe out an entire army by itself. And even if they did take the Mazid down cleanly, there’d be the fifty-to-eighty men of unknown prowess that needed killing. If they were Hrkan Skulsi, that would be too much. 
Fifty-to-eighty Skulsi.
Maybe ninety.
There were only forty three Ayramun with fifteen arrows each. Seb’s rule of thumb was that arrows go roughly three-to-one, misses to hits—depending, of course, on the skill of the archer. He didn’t have an aptitude for numbers, but it seemed like there weren’t enough arrows. It would be close, and close was dangerous. And their arrows were a kind of shit—the tips were lizard’s teeth reinforcing a hardwood point. The shafts were a strong, close-grain wood, but that made them too stiff. A band doesn’t live long in the desert if they’re always scraping by. 
He knew he wasn’t the only one worried about it all because the rest of the Ayramun were quiet as declawed cats. Even the three lizard brothers who never stopped joking around, they were quiet. Ambushes usually weren’t an exception for them. A gold caravan could be passing right by and they’d find humor in risking everyone’s discovery by tumbling a stone down a rocky slope, or blundering a fart and then claiming later that they couldn’t help it. Even these idiots were keeping low and moving slowly, naught but skinny shadows being whipped to and fro by Moto’s whistled calls though the Junei hills. 
There was no forgiving horsing around because the rumor was that a Mazid’s eyes were as good as Moto’s rock crystal lenses, and a Mazid’s ears were as good as a spade-eared bat. That caravan was close enough now that if a Mazid truly was in their midst then his superfine senses would uncover their trap if they weren’t careful. Despite this, when their troupe came to halt in a narrow valley, Seb dared to climb up the slope and sneak a peek over the crest of the hill. He could just pick out the brownish speck of that caravan against the white of the Junei plain.
He was trying to gauge the manpower when Moto hissed a whisper at him.
“Seb! Get down!”
Seb spun around and there was Moto, staring daggers into him. Seb seethed like a lizard caught unawares, then reluctantly ducked back down into the shadow of the valley slope. Moto was the only one allowed to peek out over the hills and down into the spreading plain. He was the only one allowed because he’d said he was the only one allowed. Ayram had given him that authority and Seb couldn’t argue it. If Ayram were in charge he could maybe wheedle the privilege out of him, but there was no sense in pleading a case to Moto, so Seb slid back down the valley to take up the hiding place that he’d scouted earlier in the day
It was a decent valley, long, narrow, and steep-sided, and it bowed to the left, around a lumpy hill, which was good because the hill kept their hiding places out of sight until the last moment. Still, Seb would have preferred springing the ambush in the Junei Pass proper like they usually did. Moto insisted on doing it out in the hills on account of, ‘everyone expects to be ambushed inside the pass’. Moto insisted that the best thing to do was to mirror the caravan as they made their way across the plain, then meet them in the hills and attack while their eyes were set on the gap in the mountains.
Seb appreciated the logic of it—work against expectations, but at a certain point the best land for an ambush was the best land for an ambush, didn’t matter if they knew it was coming. People worried about ambushes in bottlenecks because bottlenecks were the best place to ambush. A valley like this was no true bottleneck. Compared to the vast expanse of the Junei plain, sure, it would do, but the slopes were nowhere near the height or steepness of a mountain shelf. The Hrks could scramble up them and maybe escape. It’d be like kicking off the top of an ant hill and all of a sudden it’s a free-for-all in all directions. They’d leave the wagons, but wagons weren’t what the Ayramun were after. And if those boys were Hrkan Skulsi, then the last thing he’d want is to do is share a slope with them.
All this was building up a frightful stress. It was even getting to Moto. The man was peering through his lenses, and his searching eye was so bugged out that he looked like he was seeing straight through the stomach of Solraheen. 
Seb was close enough to him to hear him whisper, “Shit.”
Young Papi, a scrawny, short, and excitable lad with a ratty face, was squatting nearby behind a stone. He heard Moto’s adumbration too, and he asked the man, “What is it?”
Moto said, “They’re changing routes.”
“What?” Papi squeaked.
“We need to move,” said Moto.
“They’re not coming through here?”
Moto ducked down from his hilltop sight spot and tucked his lenses back in their bag. He sat for a moment, elbows on knees, a perfect picture of contemplation, then said, “They were going to come through here, but now they’re not.”
“They changed directions?” Papi asked, eyes as wide as the moon.
Moto didn’t answer. He was back to brooding.
Papi said, “If they changed direction, then you think they know we’re here?”
“We need to move,” Moto repeated as he looked over his shoulder. “We need to hop over a few hills.”
Big Dill’s bald, blue-eyed, jug-eared head popped out from behind a boulder to share his opinion on the matter. “We can’t move now!” he said. “The Mazid will see us.”
“We can move if we’re careful,” Moto replied. He flicked his hand in the air as if Dill’s opinion were a fly. “The caravan is still a ways out.”
Dill’s upper lip curled. This wasn’t a natural facial tick, it was something he did because he thought that flashing his teeth made him look fierce. He said, sharply, “If you can see the Mazid, the Mazid can see you.”
Papi said, “We should wait for Elrahet’s smoke.”
The rest of the forty Ayramun were scattered about on either side of the narrow valley, and every one of them was staring up at three men. They couldn’t hear what was being said, but over the years they’d learned to read body language from afar. Moto was doing a decent job feigning calm, but Papi and Dill’s pained expressions told everyone everything they needed to know. 
Moto picked up his unstrung recurve bow and crawled back up the hilltop.
“Papi’s right,” Seb called after him. “We should wait for the fog to move.”
“Damn waiting for that witch!” Moto cried. “If her shits not here by now, it’s not coming. We need to move.”
“What about Ayram?” Papi asked.
“Yeah,” said Dill. “Where’s Ayram?”
“Let Ayram worry about Ayram.”
From across the valley, Skitter whistled to grab everyone’s attention. Once their gazes were in hand, she pointed up to the Hias mountains behind. There, drifting out of the dark belly of the Junei Pass, was a gray, wispy mist. It was hardly noticeable, but all the same it was there and it was pouring down into the hills, growing thicker by the moment. Elrahet’s magic was coming.
The snooty look in Moto’s eyes evaporated. He beckoned Seb up to him, and Seb scurried close. Moto whispered, “That damned fog is going to make it impossible to mirror that caravan. I’m going to get down to the plain to make sure I know exactly which path through the hills they’re taking. I’m putting you in charge until I get back.”
Seb nodded. Dill overheard and was less enthused. He left his boulder and squat-walked over. “You can’t do that,” he said. “Only Ayram can put someone in charge.”
“I don’t care who’s in charge,” Moto said scornfully. “Just don’t leave this valley. Don’t even think about it.”
There wasn’t anything in Moto’s words for Dill to argue with, though the wild look in his eyes and the veins spidering out of his shaven skull said he was trying to find it. Dill was a man who was always defending his place in the pecking order. The list of men who could give him short shrift was, itself, short—there was Ayram of course, and then barely Moto. No women. Moteah could probably take him if she wanted to try, but Dill would never admit it. He had a hard enough time admitting that he’d lose a brawl to Ayram. He’d have to be dead sober, and even then it’d be all, ‘you never know’, and ‘if things happened like so-and-so’, and ‘if I were proper mad I could kill anything’.
Dill’s hateful eye chased Moto as the man scuttled down the valley slope. At the bottom Moto dusted off his burnt orange robes and then did a glancing head count to make sure all the Ayramun were where they needed to be. He broke his own law of silence by saying out loud, “Alright, you idiots—sit tight, I’ll be back soon.” Then he turned around and disappeared around the valley bend. He was gone in less time than it took Seb to fish another borcandi spine out his sleeve.
Seb was chewing through his spines at a prodigious rate. Moto leaving only made the stress worse. It was never good for discipline when a leader leaves the group, even a much begrudged deputy leader like Moto. Without a man to lead Seb knew it was only a matter of time before someone got a bright idea that needed taming. Seb figured Dill would be the first to act up, because that’s just who he was. When Dill rambled back down to his boulder he was muttering insults and curses at no one in particular.
“Loosen up, Dill”, said Forty. Forty was an older woman with a rascal’s disposition. She playfully twanged her bow at Dill—a mocking shot at his self-importance. Dill sized up this affront with a puffed-out chest, and said, “Big show. Biiiiig show. But you better be careful, Shorty, ‘cause anything can happen in an ambush. With this mist rolling in, I might not know which way I’m shooting.”
“Same goes for me,” said Forty, tongue only half-in-cheek.
“Pipe down, Sol’s sake,” said Seb.
Forty gave Dill one final fleer, then the two marched apart and settled down to watch Elrahet’s mist bleed out of the mountains. 
The humidity had already reached them—Seb could smell the pleasant musk of moistened earth. And up in the mountains, the mist was no longer merely a mist, congealing as it was into ropes of fog, fog magic’d with purpose, spooling out into slender smoky tendrils that slithered down into the hills like snakes. Some of them twirled up into the darkening sky and there the wind caught them, lifted them higher, brushing out the finer threads. A low, rolling drum of distant thunder echoed out from somewhere deep inside the mountains.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” Papi said. Seb agreed. This was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of belly magic. It was, perhaps, too good. If he could see it, then no doubt a Mazid could see it too. What a Mazid would make of it, he could only guess, and just as it was all starting to coalesce into something resembling a natural, smooth fog, a misty fissure snapped into the sky over the mountain peaks, and from it a herd of storm clouds emerged. They crept out slowly, hesitantly, like cautious cattle out of the pen, but once they were out they began to billow as they fed on the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of Elrahet’s den.
Two fingers later and these storm clouds were blotting out the sun. Their gray shadows drooped down over the Ayramun’s valley, and not long after that the drifting fog mantled the nearest hill and fell upon them. Visibility dropped so low that Seb’s near-sightedness was no longer an impairment, for no one else could see further than he. They all watched the valley bend even though it was out of sight, for they all expected that at any moment, Moto would come jogging back to get them moving again.
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, little pricklings on the skin, a light peppering of the sandy rock and clay. This didn’t last long, for the raindrops swelled and in half-a-hand they were no longer prickling but plunking. 
“A bit much, isn’t it?” Papi said as he sheltered his bow with his short brown cape. “Don’t she know I can’t shoot no good in the rain?”
“It’ll stop soon,” Seb said.
But it didn’t.
The rain dribbled off the rocks and stony clay, and where there were depressions and scars in the earth the rain was pitter-pattering puddles into being. These puddles grew into boot-swelling pools that overflowed their banks, and streams poured down the valley slopes, following the run of furrows that ancient rains had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millennia. Seb figured it was more water in one short span than this stretch of desert had seen in twenty decades. It brought out the lizards—or rather pushed them out. A little gray bonbon popped out of the clay right next to Seb’s boot. Its swiveling eye looked mightily confused by the sudden downpour. It was so flustered that it didn’t have time to notice Seb’s heel coming down on it’s head. 
Seb looked over to young Papi. The boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers.
“Might as well be swimming,” he said. “Damn this goddamn rain!”
The curse was hardly out his lips when a gnarled flash of white lightning split through the iron mist above.

CRACK-BOOM!

A chorus of startled yelps echoed out from the Ayramun.
Papi looked like he’d shat himself. “Elrahet’s never conjured more than a mist!” he squealed.
Mizm, a gray-scruffed old-timer stationed across the valley grumbled out, “That old witch is gonna get us killed!”
“Where’s Moto?” came another ragged voice out of the rain.
“Screw that,” said another. “Where’s Ayram?”
From there the Ayramun began to bicker. The specific charges and insults being thrown across the valley weren’t anything new, but the stress and fear had so softened everyone up that the simplest ‘eat my shit’ cut deep. If it weren’t for the rain dampening their fighting spirit, there might have been a brawl.
Seb didn’t begrudge them their bellyaches. They’d been fed a raw meal. None of them were prepared for this kind of weather. The ground under his butt was getting slick and muddy, and if it rained any harder it would be difficult to shoot a bow because the wetter his bowstring got, the more it lost its spring. And there was no telling what a pounding rain would do to an arrow’s flight because Seb had never shot in such conditions. He knew enough to know that it wouldn’t help. For an ambush where everything had to go right, this was downright bad.
Seb began to brood and boil, but he caught himself in the act—he was torturing himself with expectations.
He needed to recenter himself.
Things weren’t bad. They weren’t good, either, but they weren’t bad.
This kind of thinking, this breaking the world into ‘good’ and ‘bad’, this was a symptom of expectations.
The truth was that everything was happening exactly as it was supposed to happen.
Seb closed his eyes and thumbed a short chain of prayer beads that he kept stashed in his robe, and as he did, he chanted a prayer to try and repress his simmering frustration.
	
	A well without water is filled with purpose,
	An arrow in the dirt has hit its mark,
	There is no mystery below the surface,
	There is no meaning outside the Spark.

He repeated this five, ten times as he drew his shoulders in against the rain. This plunking rain. This purpose-driven rain. The fog, the bickering, these were purposeful too—to what end, Seb wasn’t sure, but now that he was looking for purpose he could sense a great deal of it, and perhaps it was brewing something terrible. The Ayramun were about to intersect with destiny—no—that was wrong to say, for destiny is ever-present. They were always intersecting with it. There were no bit-part players here. Poor and ragged as they may seem, these Ayramun were people, and all peoples are descendants of the first man and first woman, each soggy, grumpy face was the culmination of a hundred thousand generations of toil, as many generations as the Hrkan Lords themselves, and so each were as important, as godlike, for if but one of them was missing then events would not unfold as they were meant to. 
But he shouldn’t privilege the living. If the rock under his feet did not exist then he would not be sitting here, he would be sitting somewhere else, and thus the future, bounded by lines of immanence extending from the present, would wind a different weave. Yes, this very rock was sacred, as all things are sacred, as the dead lizard under his boot was sacred. All things are filled with the Spark’s sacred power.
“Seb! Quit your fartin’ about!”
“What!?”
The call had come from Dill. He and a few other miserable looking louts were down on the valley floor, straddling either side of a trickling stream that was building up in the middle of the valley’s run. Seb was about to chastise them for doing Sol-knows-what when he noticed that Moto had returned and was standing in their midst. Seb leapt to his feet and filtered down the valley slope with the rest of the Ayramun. 
Down in the valley’s belly, Moto face was alight with an excitement that no one shared.
“What’s wrong with you people?” he asked. “We’re about to bag us a Mazid and you look mad about it.”
Tizm, the old bent-backed wonder, kicked at the swelling stream and pointed to the sky and shouted, “The old witch has overcooked it!”
A refrain of agreement rained down. A few shushed, then others shushed back. Moto tried to calm them all with plaintive hands, saying, “People. Please.”
“Please my ass!” said Tizm. “This rain is gonna ruin everything!”
“The rain is perfect,” said Moto. “It’s got the Hrks hunkered down in a valley finger.”
“The Hrks?” asked Papi.
“Yes,” said Moto with a wary grin. “It’s Hrks we’re hunting. Hrkan Skulsi.”
The admission that it was Skulsi, not Blackwood caravan men, sent a wave of discontent rippling through the gathered Ayramun. Moto tried to stem the unease by lying. Seb knew it was a lie because when Moto was working through a big lie he’d smile and whine at the same damn time, like people’s doubting faces were annoying to him. “They’ve gone and lined themselves up against a wall for us,” he said. “Jumping them will be the easiest thing in the world, but we’ve got to hurry.”
Someone on the outer edge of the huddle blurted out, “What’s this about Hrks?”
Moto raised his voice above the rain. “The Minder and his Mazid didn’t come with a Blackwood caravan. They came with a Hrkan guard.”
Another round of shouting broke out, followed by another round of shushing and counter-shushing. Moto again tried to calm those gathered with nothing but his frantic hands. In the end he resorted to a sharp whistle, which shut everyone right up.
Moto said, “The fact that it’s Hrks doesn’t change a damned thing.”
Dill’s bald head stuck up above the huddle like a veiny, boiled egg floating in a stew. He spoke up and said, “All the better! I’d rather kill a Hrk than a Jandri man!” 
Moto nodded and said, “They’re bedded down like rabbits in a long, straight ravine.”
“The one with all the karkle bushes?” Seb asked.
“They’ve all got karkle bushes in them,” said Moto.
“The valley we’re standing in don’t.”
“It doesn’t matter,” said Moto. “All we have to do is sneak up and shoot some Hrks. It’ll be the easiest thing in the world. I know it’s raining hard, but I’m not asking you to feather a Hrk at ten-score yards. With this rain and fog we can get up close. You won’t miss. You can throw stones at them if you want to. You can stuff mud down their throats if you want to.”
“Where’s Ayram?” asked another.
 A quiver of frustration flashed in Moto’s face and he shot a quick, beseeching look to the heavens before saying, “This is happening whether he’s here or not, whether you like it or not. And it’s happening now, before this rain and fog let up. Let’s get moving!”
He turned and pushed his way past a few Ayramun and set off back towards the bend. After the briefest hesitation, Big Dill marched after him, and at his encouragement, everyone else followed. Together they were a small, sad herd of outland folk, a jumble of soggy wool and tired feet slapping the mud aside the building stream.
Seb kept to the back as they eventually climbed up and out of the valley and then crossed over a few others. They tramped through a flooding basin, and all the while Seb eyed the rainy mist with unease, for he could feel providence at work in that mist. Unlike the providence that people pray for and expect, this providence was providing something undesired, Seb was sure of that. Destructidence is what it was. Deathidence. There wasn’t an established word for it, which itself was a telling sign of the plundering spirit of the age. People only cared about their relationship to the gods so long as they were getting something good out of it. These Ayramun were no different.
Eventually Gugi found his way to Seb at the back of the wandering troupe. The skinny man’s face was agog with fear. He clearly wanted to talk, so Seb indulged him.
“Whaddya want?” Seb asked.
“Ya know where we headed, right?”
“I do.”
“It’s that cursed ravine, the one where I found that dead body.”
“I know.”
“You should say somethin’ to the others.”
“Why not you?”
“I don’t ever say shit so no one’s gonna listen to me.”
“They won’t listen to me either.”
“They would. I would. That ravine is cursed, and people are gonna die if we get down in it.”
“I thought you said if we moved that body out of that ravine, then the curse would be moved out with it?”
“What do I know about curses? I was just sayin’ shit. For all I know that curse is what brought this storm and lured them Hrks down in it.”
Seb said, “Are you tryin’ to get out of payin’ me my spines?”
Gugi spat a wad of borcandi juice right where Seb was stepping, clearly upset that Seb could think about debts in a time like this. Before he could voice that concern, a muted horse’s whinny was heard through the splashing rain. Everyone instinctively crouched down and rushed to the shelter of a sloping mound. They were still a few-score yards away from the ravine where the Hrks were sheltering. Nothing of those troops could be seen through the mist.
Moto raced back down the line of the Ayramun to crouch down next to Seb and Gugi. Voice low, he asked, “You two scouted this ravine, right?”
Gugi and Seb both nodded.
“Anything we should know about it?”
Gugi was quick to respond. “It’s cursed and we shouldn’t be here.”
“Cursed? What do you mean, cursed?”
Seb said, “This be the ravine where we found that dead body.”
Moto snorted, almost laughed, then said, “I need to know the lay of the land. I can’t see through this damned mist so I don’t know if there’s an easy out for them up on the eastern side.”
“Moto,” said Gugi, leaning into his words, “I’m tellin’ you, this place is cursed. It’s gonna get us killed.”
“So what? If it’s cursed for us, it’s cursed for them too. Doubly so for them, cause they’re sitting in it.”
“Yeah, but we the ones who found the body! We the ones that been warned! Not them. Us—Me!”
Moto gave up on Gugi and turned to Seb. “Is there any way in and out of that long stretch that might make it easy for them?”
Seb shook his head. “That stretch is mostly steep. There is one little nook on the other side that’s kinda like a stair but that’s it.” 
“How wide?”
“Not that wide.”
Moto paused to think, then said, “I want you two to go back a ways, and cross to the other side of the ravine where it’s safe. Then work your way back down the other side and then set up where that stair is.”
“Just us two?” Gugi asked.
Moto looked her square in the eyes, turned and motioned towards his sister, Moteah, who was not at all enthused to be at her brother’s beck and call. Like Moto, she carried herself with an air of authority, though she was even more arrogant about it than her upfront brother.
Moto looked her square in the eyes, “Get Dill and twelve others to follow Seb and Gugi. You’re going to set up on the other side of the ravine, and we’re going to try and push the Hrks towards you. So be quick and be ready. There won’t be a whistle. When they come, they come.” 
Moteah snuck away, gathered up Dill and the nearest twelve Ayramun, then brought them to Seb and Gugi. Gugi wasn’t about to take charge, so Seb crowned himself and led them all back towards the mountains, keeping the course of the cursed ravine a few-score yards away to his right. When he felt they’d gone far enough, he led them sliding down into the steep ravine, and then they had a tough, nervy scramble back up the other side. Steep as it was they had to help each other up, and once up they headed back towards the plain, keeping low and quiet.
Seb knew what features he was looking for, but with the rain and mist there was no way he’d find the spot until he was already upon it. The fog was so thick that he kept second guessing whether he was following the right ravine. Nonetheless he kept going, one foot in front of the other, trying not to think too much about the fight that was only fingers away. Soon, he was confronted with the sound of snorting wagon ponies drinking their fill of rainwater.
Seb crouched down, and the rest Ayramun behind him did likewise. He ambled over to the edge of the ravine and slithered up against a big, solid boulder that leaned over the ravine’s lip. From there he could hear horse hooves stamping in the ravine’s stream. If a horse was that close, then a Hrk might be closer. He didn’t want to peek over the boulder to get the lay of the scene, but when he heard the clank of wood on wood he couldn’t help himself. He steeled his nerves and peered over the boulder and down into the ravine.
Right below him were two horses still hitched to an empty wagon, and behind them were two more horses and another empty wagon, and whatever was behind them was lost to the mist. There was only one man. He was a natural Hrk, so far as Seb could tell, a natural Hrk with redblack hair and a full black beard that made his head seem massive. Clad in sopping wet browns, he was darting to and fro amongst the wagons, prepping them against the rain with all the urgency of a man who knew the curse that water puts on a wagon that’s been drawing dry. It swells the wheels when they’re already squeezed tight by the thin, shrunk-on iron tire. When rain moves on and the wheel dries out it starts to crack and up sprouts gaps. Sand gets into the wax-greased innards of the hubs and grinds against bronze bushings. Prophylactic measures must be taken, and taken as fast as possible. Seb was surprised to see only one man making an issue out of it. He was driving himself insane as he scampered through the rain and fumbled with the wheel tents that were ready-tied to the sides of the wagon bed. The beds themselves looked empty.
Where were all the others?
Seb turned to his troupe behind him, and the confusion on his face must have been easy to read because Dill grumbled and invited himself up to Seb’s rock. The man kept his vein-strapped head tucked against the rock’s hump as he peered out around it.
Upon seeing the wagons and the lonesome Hrk, Dill’s confusion surpassed Seb’s. His eyes searched for some sign of the rest of the enemy, but found none.
“Shit.”
Moteah joined the two men at the boulder and quietly stole a look for herself. Her usually uptight expression didn’t show the slightest hint of concern.
“What’s goin’ on?” Dill asked her in a whisper.
“Why would I know?” Moteah said.
“Your brother’s the one who went scouting.”
“Do I look like Moto to you?”
“Yeah, you do,” said Dill. “If he sprouted tits I couldn’t tell you two apart.”
Moteah’s brow tightened even further. It wasn’t anger. Seb called it ‘severe disinterest’. It was one of Moteah’s two expressions, the other being plain old disinterest. Problem was, that look wasn’t a good way to deal with a man like Dill. The best thing to do was to pretend not to notice him, even ignore him altogether. Unfortunately for Moteah, she was too pretty to get away with ignoring a man like Dill. To a man like Dill, her wrinkled brow was nothing but shirred meat, meant nothing other than what it was.
“Bitch is leadin’ us into a trap,” he whispered to the others.
“I’m not leading anyone anywhere. Seb is.”
Seb felt the eyes of both these schemers bear down upon him. 
“Don’t lookit me,” he whispered back. “I didn’t set this up.”
They were still looking at him.
Seb pointed east, in the direction of the Junei Plain, and whispered, “There’s a overhang in the ravine down a ways. It could do as a cave. It could be that the Hrks have taken it up.” 
“Seb, you’re a soilbucket.” Dill’s voice was uncomfortably loud. “This is a goddamned trap if I ever seen one. I bet my nuts they know we’re here.” 
Dill turned to the iron mist from whence they’d came, and he cast his suspicious eye about, as if the dark boulders lurking in the haze were really Hrkan Skulsi in disguise. He unwrapped his bow from its cow-leather strap and strung it with an easy flick. The rest of the Ayramun caught on to his excitement, and they strung their bows in kind. Then they all thirteen of them, Gugi included, crept up to join Seb, Moteah, and Dill at the lip of the ravine. When their fists were full of arrows, Dill decided for himself that the time was right to strike. He gave his bow a pull to test the string, and then he stood up and loosed an arrow at the unaware Hrkan wainwright.
The arrow didn’t have far to go. Almost as soon as the fletching was free from Dill’s fingers the arrowhead was planting itself into the back of that Hrkan neck. The man clutched and gurgled, then fell to his knees and splashed down face-first into the budding rainwater stream. His head was buried full in the running water, and downstream one of the horses whinnied and stamped when it found its drink suddenly awash with blood.
Dill ducked back behind the boulder and gave Seb a contented grin, like he’d just won the battle all by himself. Then they waited. Moto had said there would be a whistle, so they just had to wait for the Hrks to come. It was unbearable. They waited for at least a full finger, and by then the rain started to let up and the sound of the ravine’s running water in the ravine was louder than the plunks which poured from the sky.
Dill moved from behind the boulder and made to climb down into the ravine.
Seb caught the hem of his robe and pulled him back.
“What are you doing?” Seb rasped.
“There’s no one here,” said Dill calmly.
“Moto said we should wait!”
Dill stretched his arms out to gesture at all the nothingness down in the ravine. He said, “Wait for what?”
“A signal.”
“Signal to do what? What are we ambushing, the horses?”
One of the Ayramun, a young one named Ritt, popped his head up and said, “There’s Hrks down there somewhere, I feel it.”
“Quiet down!” Moteah snipped.
Much to Moteah’s dismay, and Seb’s amazement, Dill stood straight up and put his finger and his thumb to his lips and whistled out a three-chirp alarm—bright and sharp. The sound cut through the falling sheet of misty rain as easily as if it weren’t there at all. The horse’s ears swiveled as they regarded Dill with some confusion.
Before anyone could do anything, Dill scrambled down to the bottom of the ravine, arrow knocked, and waited for something to happen. When nothing did, he growled a curse and shot an arrow into the back of the already dead Hrk. 
“I’m not stayin’ here no longer,” he said.
With that, Dill marched across the ravine and tossed his bow up onto the other side and started to climb out.
Moteah swept up in Seb’s periphery and shot an arrow right at him.
In clean dry air a gull-feather arrow with a whistling nock would trill with excitement when released, but soggy as it was, Moteah’s arrow flew across the ravine without so much as a whine. Dill had no idea what hit him, and it hit him in the back, right inside the left shoulder blade and continued on through the heart. He fell backwards into the ravine and was limp dead before he hit the ground.
Seb gasped. It was against the rules to even scratch one of their own, even a throbbing cock like Dill. Killing an Ayramun was a privilege reserved for Ayram. But before he could get out a word, Moteah grabbed him by the breast of his robe and yanked him down behind the boulder.
Seb twisted her hand off him and held it firm in his wiry grip.
“What’d ya kill him for!?”
Moteah put her finger to her lips and shushed him. Seb grimaced then spat the whole borcandi blob that had been stewing in his cheek. He spat it right at Moteah’s face. Moteah ducked out of its terrifying arc, quick as a cat, and the wad landed with a splat on Gugi’s chest. Gugi squealed in disgust as he flicked the gooey gunk away. Moteah clapped his mouth shut with her free hand and her eyes flared caution at both men. She pointed with her chin to the opposite bank and mouthed a silent warning—Hrks.
Seb let go of her wrist and peered around the boulder. There across the ravine were two shawled figures wandering out of the mist. At first he took them for Ayramun, but the first of them made a foreign gesture towards the other, and when Seb saw a flash of white under one of their ruddy cloaks he knew for sure—these were Hrkan men. Then the two figures paused, cocked their heads towards Seb like they’d felt his thoughts ripple the fog between them, and they dropped down flat against the ground.
Seb ducked fast behind his boulder. He turned to Moteah and had to restrain himself from shouting. 
“They know!” he whispered.
The sound was hardly out his mouth when from behind them, on their own cozy side of the ravine, a Hrkan horn of war thrilled the air.
BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommmm
Hrkan battle horns are deep and drooping bleats that tremble the bones of even the most well armored lizards, and Seb was clad in nothing but rags. When the horn blast jumped up behind him it startled him out of his skin. He yelped and swore and swiveled around to face the terror, and there, deep in the fog, running right towards him, was a blurry host of men, Hrkan Skulsi, white coats flashing bright under their brown disguises. Maybe twenty or more of them. To Seb’s near-sighted eyes they were a leggy, white speckled blob moving along in silence, all business, just jogging right up like they were lost and about to ask for the way to the road. They didn’t even try to intimidate with screams and yells, for in truth they were killers, not soldiers. The power of the Mazidai had long made armies obsolete, so the kind of professional fighting man that the Hrkan world breeds is one who lusts for the frenzy of small skirmishes where it's man against man.
The horn bleated again.
BWEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooommmm
The Skulsi blob began to sprint. 
Seb felt a strange warmth running down his thigh and he realized that he’d pissed himself. Moteah loosed an arrow at the running blob and before she saw the results, she took off sprinting west, back up along the ravine and towards the mountain. Seb took off after her, and the rest of the Ayramun followed. They trimmed the ravine, pursued by that mob of Hrks, while on the opposite bank those two Hkran cloaks had somehow multiplied into twenty. They shadowed the Ayramun, silent like the others, and they bunched up against the ravine as they waited for the terrain to present an opportunity to close the gap and kill. Seb nocked an arrow midstride and shot it across but it flew harmlessly into the mist. Others had more luck—Gugi put an arrow through the leading man’s leg, and the man behind him was struck down when an arrow rammed into the side of his skull. The two figures crumpled to the ground and those behind bumbled over them, but this did little to allay the chase. 
Then Moteah jumped down into the ravine.
Seb wondered what insanity could have possessed her to give those Hrkan Skulsi a leaping chance, and his wonder was answered in the next instant, when a thin, golden beam of Mazidfire came ripping right by his ear.
The line of this blazing beam shot out in the misty distance. Seb ducked low and avoided its swipe, but the men behind him weren’t so lucky. The fire ran right through the back of Gugi’s head and burst out of his eye-socket as if his brains and bone weren’t there. As his body slumped down the stripe of fire burned a kerf into his skull, and then the fireline’s distant fulcrum swiveled and the beam of death swiped a downwards arc through the air, cutting four Ayramun into uneven halves as the fire smashed into the earth, sizzling the soggy clay as it went.
As suddenly as it came, the Mazidfire was gone. Somewhere in the misty distance, the unseen Mazid had closed its mouth, and what was left of that golden beam ran roaring into earth, leaving in its wake charred flesh, black glass, glowing stone, and smoke.
All those still alive threw themselves down the ravine’s steep slope. Seb bumped into a karkle bush on the way down and rolled uncontrolled to the bottom where he flopped belly-first onto the muddy ground and slid with a splash into the ravine’s nascent stream. The rest of the Ayramun were already scrambling to their feet and fleeing along after Moteah, but Seb stayed put. There in front of his very eyes was the bush he’d seen that morning, the bush from under which he’d pulled that dead body. Its black twigs bloomed above him like a monument to fate. His mind was unpinned by the significance of it, and he felt that awesome humbling chill which only comes when one glimpses under the veil of reality.
His mind spun with the significance of it. He tried to reel himself back by telling himself this bush was just a bush—no more or less a major player in the divine plan as the mud squishing against his stomach, or even Seb himself. Yes, this bush was just a bush.
And yet…
And yet he was supposed to crawl up under that bush and so he did. He crawled up under it, and he lay himself down, right down where that dead boy had been, and he watched through the brambles as the Hrks descended upon his straggling companions.
Ten of the leaping Hrks were shot down by arrows before their feet landed in the ravine, leading to a lopsided melee in favor of the Ayramun. Yet the Skulsi, undaunted, charged on. Their feet flung mud as their powerful strides closed the distance as fast as wolves. The fighting was brutal, and Seb cowered under the bush lest the obligations of battle came to him. His gut turned at the sight of one man sticking his boot on the back of another’s head, suffocating him in the 


*mud. This cruelty was paid in turn with a knife stuck through his gut. Side whittled side until there were only two combatantsremaining, two mud-grumbled men breathing hard with blades held out before them. Neither made a move as both were content to catch their breath
The rain had stopped. The ravines stream was trickling. Seb felt the itch of purpose stirring in his stomach. Perhaps the bush had reserved him for this very moment. Here was an opportunity for decisive action, and this was all anyone could ever ask for, clarity of cause and effect—the outcome of a battle turned with him. Seb twisted out from under his bush to fire an arrow at the man he took to be a Hrk, but just as he did, two figures stepped up to the lip of the ravine above him. The shorter one opened its mouth and a golden beam of Mazidfire burst out. It cut both combatants in two.
Seb froze in fear at the sight of the Mazid and its Minder. He hustled back under the bush.
He had never seen a Mazid before, and he couldn’t see much of it now. It was shorter than its Minder by a good foot, a child’s height, and it was skinny, and its misshapen frame was wrapped up in black robes and a black cowl like a penitent priest. The rumors were that a Mazid looked and moved like a human but its eyes were ice. Seb couldn’t see the eyes, he could only see its hands and the general gauntness of its face, which was white as sea foam, like the creature had been dipped in cream. Its chin was smooth and hairless as an egg. The Minder was a normal Jandri man, dressed in the standard scribal robes—rich blue with a blue hooded cape that mantled his broad shoulders like a pelt.
Another man joined the two figures up on that bank. Unlike the others, he was a natural born Hrk through and through—blackred hair, greying around the temples, with copper skin and eyebrows so thick they could flog lizardskin. His dark cloak was held together by a silver sunrose brooch—the mark of military command. This man marched up to the much shorter Mazid bearing a look of such contempt that it seemed to Seb that he was about strike the creature, but he merely pointed to the dead men down in the ravine and shouted, “Explain yourself!”
The Mazid said meekly, “I don’t know what you mean.”
“You killed one of my men.”
“I didn’t know which was which.”
“So you killed both of them?” The commander turned to the Mazid’s Minder and said, “I don’t know how you people breed these things, but something’s wrong. Each one is dumber than the last.”
“You preach to the choir, captain. You’ve only had to deal with it for a week, whereas I am bonded to it.”
“Well get a better grip on it!”
“Believe me, I’ve tried. But the guild is married to their methods. They say they’re balancing intelligence with docility, but then they bind me to this Mazid which is neither intelligent nor amenable to instruction, and when I complain they tell me to bear it like a man, and move on. So bear it, captain—those are not my words, but theirs.”
The Skulsi captain looked like he was about to strangle them both.
The Mazid, caught like a child between quarreling parents, bowed its head respectfully and said, “I’m sorry.”
The Minder tissked his annoyance. “What use does the captain have for an apology? Tell me, what can he do with it?”
“He can—”
“That was a rhetorical question.”
In the Minder’s hand was a short rod of wood wrapped in braided leather. He held it up to the captain and said, “You may hit it if you like. It won’t hurt the creature. It doesn’t feel pain, but I find it works out my frustrations nonetheless.”
The Captain took the rod firm in hand.
“Avoid the head and neck,” said the Minder.
The captain swung the rod and brought it down hard on the Mazid’s shoulder socket. The whole arm sunk down and went limp, clearly dislocated, and it looked brutal, but Seb winced more than the Mazid did.
The Captain stepped back to appreciate the bludgeoning, then said, “They don’t make Mazidai like they used to.”
“They don’t.”
“It’s a wonder the Lords make use of these things at all,” said the captain. “They’ve long outlived their usefulness. We Skulsi can handle these outlaws on our own.”
The scribal Minder appeared hurt by this remark. “Captain,” he said, “the only reason you’re dealing with outlaws at all is because the outland tribes are too whipped by the Mazidai to become anything more than outlaws. Get rid of me and my kind, and you might find yourself on the front line of a real battle.”
“What do you mean, a real battle?”
“I meant no disrespect.”
“It sounded like disrespect.”
“I assure you, I meant no disrespect.”
The captain glared at the Minder, then 
“We don’t have time for this,” he said. “We’ve work to do.”
“No,” said the Minder as he drew his lips tight. “I won’t have a captain of the Skulsi brewing discontent behind my back. Out with it.”
The old captain glowered and said, “Remember that you are here to make things easier for me, not the other way around. And I’d say that killing my men outright is a violation of that mission. Worthy of censure. If you were not a Minder I would have had you burned out for incompetency.”
The Minder was unimpressed. “Yes, if I were not a Minder you could do all manner of things. But fantasies are the domain of children and beggars, not soldiers who stand up straight. White light, we speak of the decline of the Mazidai, but if you are Hrkan Skulsi then I worry doubly for the Lordship.”
“You have a problem with me?”
“Look at you—pomped up like you deserve something better than what you’ve gotten, like you don’t understand that I can speak to you how I want. Worry about yourself, captain, lest that self-important stomach growl too loudly forget the station of its Spark.”
“Are you threatening me?”
“Yes. You should be stricter with your sentiments, given how easily I could end you.”
The captain smirked, put his hands on his hips, and eyed the pudgy Minder with amusement. He said, “I doubt you have the control. Just the other day one of my men saw your Mazid let an outland poke run free. It could have easily burned the man down, but it didn’t.”
The Minder looked upon his Mazid with some confusion and asked it, “Is that true?”
“Yes,” said the Mazid meekly. “The man posed no imminent threat.”
“Did I tell you to spare our quarry if it posed no imminent threat?”
“No.”
“Did I give any order that could be construed as a grant of mercy to any of these outland pokes?”
“No.”
“Then tell me, why did you not burn him down?”
The Mazid gave no answer.
“That was not a rhetorical question,” the Minder said.
“I guess…I’m not sure”
“You’re not sure!?” the Minder exclaimed, as if the utterance was not possible.
“Hah!” laughed the captain. “You see? You’ve barely got a hold of that thing.”
“Oh, shut up.”
“Wait until Lord Stryt hears about this. He’ll have you out in the pastures where you belong, minding sheep not Mazidai.”
The Minder countenanced the captain’s threat with a grim nod. Seb could feel the captain’s great smugness even from his spot down under his bush. Then the Minder said to the Mazid, “Obo, kill that man.”
The Mazid’s throat began to glow gold and an eyeblink later its mouth was alight with the fire of gods. A thin beam shot out, and a heartbeat later the captain crumpled to the ground—in the place where his forehead used to be was a black and smoldering hole. What was left of his face was fixed in hurtled surprise.
The Minder grunted in satisfaction, then he looked down on his Mazid with contempt and said, “Don’t ever think about what you want or don’t want. You don’t have wants. Get creative with my orders again and I’ll have us both sent back to the guild for—”
His words were interrupted by the sight of the Mazid wandering off. It shuffled towards the ravine’s lip and began to climb down into it. Despite its apparent frailty, its movements were deliberate and precise. It hopped down to the bottom and began to walk towards Seb’s bush.
“What are you doing?” the Minder spat, but the Mazid did not answer. It was nearing Seb’s bush, and it was close enough now that Seb could see its gaunt visage clearly. It was a ghoul of a person, with gray, empty eyes, and when they settled on Seb he saw a shimmer of gold behind them.
“Stop!” the Minder commanded with a shout. The word seemed to shake the Mazid’s spine. It paused, struggling with each step, then continued on as if laden with chains.
“I said STOP!”
The Minder’s command shook the Mazid whole, and it stumbled forward, resisting.
Up on the ledge, the Minder pulled himself up to his full height.
He shouted, “STOP!”
Every single muscle in the Mazid’s body snapped taut. The sad creature stood still for a moment, but it stood unbalanced, and when the lightest breeze blew through the ravine it fell over stiff as stone. The sound of the Mazid splashing into the muddy ground was slight, as if it were no heavier than a tossed blanket.
Its unsettling eyes remained unnervingly alert. They swiveled in their sockets and found Seb inside his bush. Seb lay transfixed. He’d looked every manner of creature in the eye in his long journeys through the Sand, and in each of them he’d found some sort of kinship—not so when he beheld the Mazid.
His fixation on this creature was broken when the Minder stomped down into the belly of the ravine. The short climb had put him out of breath, and he stood over the Mazid and gave it a probing kick. Then he cursed his own luck, and then he bent down picked the creature up and put it upon on his shoulder and began to walk away.
Seeing the Minder’s back turned, Seb’s instinct for murder took over. He slithered out of his bush, drew his knife, and matched the Minder’s footfalls. He closed the distance until he could no longer contain his excitement, and he screamed such a deep and wild scream that it surprised even himself. The Minder dropped the stiff Mazid in fright, and Seb’s knife was suddenly upon him, and it followed him down to the ground with a flurry of blows. The Minder rolled around and tried to scramble free, but Seb’s knife was there, again in the back, under the shoulder blade, in the ribs, in the neck, then severing two tendons in his flailing arm. Seb jabbed at the man’s throat, and did not let up until his knife slipped out of his hand.
The Minder was dead.
Seb looked towards the Mazid, and it had gone limp. Even its eyes were stilled, for it was no longer bound to any will. 
Seb picked the Mazid up. It was twice as light as the dead boy he’d carried earlier that day. He carried it over to the karkle bush because he didn’t know what else to do with it. There was no clear divine sign here for him to read. He might be alone. The rest of the Ayramun might be dead. It could be that Skulsi would come wandering back at any moment. So he hid. He hid underneath that karkle bush with that limp Mazid, and for the first time in his entire sober life he was living completely in the moment. He felt like a god.</Text>

            <Text>The thing in itself - KANT - we can’t really know it. - there cannot be a seperation between us and the world, between subject and object. - 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w85nGQ_KUgE&amp;t=209s
Hegel rejects - why do we feel like our knowledge is true?  Innate desire to know, to build these models.  Transform philosophy from the love of knowing into actual knowing. Dialectics - negates an preceding, contains it.  Unity of itself and its opposite. Hop off from knowing the thing in itself to the process of knowing. 
Thought generates its own content by producing differences within itself. Our concept of the world pushes up against the thing in itself, but uf uts not quite right, the universe intrudes and pushes on the edges of our ideas. - the suface between the thing amd the concept. This is dialectcal movement.
Dialectical sequence 
- affirmation
- negation
- negation of negation
Observe the self - I am the negation. Without me looking and percieving, the object is nothing, which iswhy Hegel needs to turn to the subject. I negate myself as negation, by including myself in the process of observations. What am I doing here? What is this process? Where am I going? Subject being aware of itself perceiving.
Knowledge is about commanding the world. THe will is free. But what drives it? Our self consciousness seems to have no content of its own. It is driven from within by a dynamic nothingness that compels me to fill the void that is myself and transform it into a something. 
The terrible realization that while I have command of things, I also need things. To find the self, get rid of all thoughts and ideas and objects that are given to it - including the body. 
Desire is the negative force by which the self seeks to cancel the otherness of the external world in order to affirm itself as absolute. 
True self-consciousness requires two self-consciousnesses. We come across an object in the desert of the self-conscious that we cannot destroy, discard, or consume - another self-consciousness. Recognition is fundamental - a concept of the self as recognized, I am an object myself, to myself, out there in the world. TOGETHERNESS. You are the idea the world has of you. You are your reflection in the world.
The basis of self-consciousness is desire itself.
I want to be recognized by the other, but that includes keeping the other around, and vice versa. There are two self-consciousness watching eachother, registering each other’s movements. But which one leads? Follows? Ideas? 
A conflict for recognition - recognized as free - for ourselves. In the end, on comes out on top, and one on bottom, one commands, and one obeys.
Self-consciousness is this standpoint - it must resist recognizing an other as a free being, just as, on the other hand, each must concern itself with eliciting recognition within the other’s self-consciousness, being posited as an independent being. The single self is not able to bear the other’s being independent of it, so that they necessarily drift into a struggle. 
Fear of lord is beginning of wisdom - the beginning of negation. 
Freedom from it - the only thing that you have that no one can conquer is thought - STOICISM — the principle is that consciousness is a thinking being, and that something is essential for it, or is true and good, only insofar as consciousness conducts itself in it as a thinking being. Stoic says, it doesn’t matter what happens to me on the outside, I can choose what to think about. Stoics and skeptics negate everything that is posited to them.

ME - the canvas makes statements, the artist pushes and pulls and reacts to it. We make knowledge statements, the universe pushes and pulls and reacts to it. 

We are ashamed of ourselves and our selfhood, our feebleness, and we look towards the universal idea. Unknowable.
The death of christ means that god has withdrawn from the world, and there are no longer mediators between god and the self. The unhappy consciousness concludes that god himself is dead. But the transcendent is immanent. God contaisn all relations. He is omnipresent, omnipotent. Hegel rejects traditional christianity because it seperates the self from the transcendant. 
Reason as something that is split apart from the real world.
Reason is transcendental. When we think in universals we are doing something which separates us from the earthly world. Reason allows us to take the particulars of the material world and systematize it in a transcendental way. 
We are born with biological hardware which allows us to, a priori, have the ability to reason. 
This operating system bends how we percieve the world. We are stuck viewing the world through our biological framework. To know the thing in itself is impossible. Hegel says that Kant builds a boundary between cognition and the absolute because he fears it. Criticized as an abstract formalist. He says we need to experience the world to fit it into our framework, but like a coward, he says we cannot really connect to that world. Hegel points out that we need the thing-in-itself, that the dialectical process takes the logic of the thing-in-itself and slowly unfolds in relationship to it. Kant might be right in that our framework bends the world, but he neglects to explore how the perspective is, throughout history, and through logic, unbent. 
I study the world empirically, geology, meteorology, etc. All those particulars, and through my reason I see universals. I see the rabbit has sharp teeth, not because of what it knows, but because of its relationship to the environment, to the idea of sharpness. Reason is getting away from the empirical world, concepts which stand above life. 
Sharpness will still apply to a different thing even if the rabbit is not there. The rabbit has no idea why it has sharp teeth, but reason does. Nature has no history, reason organizes into a wider system of thought. It is more than it. 
But we try to use reason to study itself, in the same way self-consciousness tries to study self-consciousness. We don’t see much of reason when we turn inwards - we see emotion. SO for hegel, reason isn’t cold and detached, it is reaching out into the world to embody. Reason feels itself to be right. Others don’t understand.
Kant is scared of this in morality. Reason is selfish. So he looks for universalisibility. 
THe problem for the idealist is they have to suppress their own selfish desires. What if I don’t want to be nice today? Virtue is brought back down to earth as the realization of the fact that the universal runs through the individual, the finite. The idealist says, don’t be selfish, selflessness is the universal aspiration. The world would be a better place - but consider the negation - the way of the world. The way of the world whispers, sometimes you need to be selfish.
The idealist must get down into the dirtiness of the particulars, but with these the self can become self-confident. It doesn’t need kings to tell it what to do. 
I posit a universal idea, like stonemasorny, I return to myself, and I do it.

Terry Pinkhard - on greece - because of the necessity of the ideal of self-sufficiency, the polis had to be small enough to enable face to face interaction. This made the greek polis too small to defend itself, and when another, well-organized powerful empire showed up at its door, it no longer had the power, motivational or otherwise, to resist…even the most ordinary citizen would have to be able to think for himself about which law—the divine or human law, or even which among many divine laws—he was required to follow. That left citizens at odds with themselves and potentially at odds with each other.
Story of antigone - tension between family divine law, and public law, each see themselves as absolute and the other as unjust.
The greeks found purpose in public life in a way that romans could not. Rome denied the necessity of having a bounded social space that provided its members with a fundamental orientation in life—that is, a social space in which determinate goods are available to people which are made up of the elements of a common way of doing things and institutions transmitting that into practical knowledge of the world.
Why stoicism rose in robe - it was natural to want to distance oneself from the arbitrariness, the slavishness, the brutality of the roman world, and instead focus on inner-life. 
The absence of an ethical whole is the soil out of which culture grows. Culture speaks of the divide between individuality and universality. For hegel we’re talking about the idea of culture, the construct which we can posit ourselves. Self-alienated spirit - the external is internal too. To become ‘cultured’ is to become something that comes from the ‘we’. To become a universal being. What fuels dialectical movement is the distinction between subject and object, individual and culture, being one, so that we feel no painful divide between our own desires and what’s imposed culturally.
What the consciouseness wants is that, through the general will, the individual obeys laws that he himself has authorised. Law in this sense is not external to the individual but emanates from him. 
For kant, goodness lies outside the self in some idealistic region. For hegel, it must come from within, morality, duty, etc. Becomes an individual drive rather than an abstract thought. Law for the sake of the self instead of the self for the sake of the law.
The infinite draws along the finite, whispering, this is what’s reasonable, this is what’s rational, logical, etc. Substance empties itself through time, becomes more complex, fuller, more realized.

Religion - “What enlightenment declares to be an error and a fiction is the very same thing as Enlightenment itself.” - Reason is as ‘made up’ as ‘god’.
- the Phenomenology is thus the logical reconstruction of God’s suffering in time. It is the process by which god comes to know himself- and fully be himself. In an early work, Hegel posed as the ultimate philosophy what he called “the speculative Good Friday”. God, in separating himself from himself, suffers with us.

Aristotle’s Intellecky - a thing’s natural purpose - acorn to become an oak tree.
Hegel thinks all roads lead to Hegel’s writing desk. 

Every generation thinks its at the end of history - new idea that has liberated previous world from its chains. But this is nothing new, we’ve been doing this ever since Hegel.
Most people who think they are breaking new ground, are just traveling well worn paths, but just have slightly different vocabularies. And not only that, but if you point it out to them, that most of this is implicitly hegelian , they would laugh and say you don’t understand. Ever since Hegel gave the idea that history had meaning, and all of human existence has some cohesion to it, everyone feels in a priveledged position of knowing that they were somehow at the end of this. The occupational hazards of being a philosopher of history. Every philosopher of history believes that all of history leads to them.
Broken through the cosmic egg.
We all feel the need to create a novelty that is spurious but entertaining. That is our homage to Hegel.

            <Title>Seb the Servant</Title>
            <Text>Seb waved a hand over Mandri’s sightless eyes. The boy was catatonic, limbs limp on the cold stone floor. Seb leaned over Mandri’s face and he could see the boy’s pupils flicker as his mind fell deeper and deeper into the trance of the God’s Eye burgeon. 
What sights did he see?
Seb had taken God’s Eye three times. He could never recall exactly what had occurred. There was only the sense that his Spark had blossomed and then burst, and he felt like he’d died and rose again. What lingered was the shadow of a memory of a feeling of brushing up against omniscience. That sensation was enough, sometimes, to sustain the illusion that he had finally killed his Self for good, but one night’s sleep and he was back to normal.
Always back to normal.
He didn’t like God’s Eye burgeons because of that. It was like treating a beggar to a Lord’s feast and kicking him out onto the street again. Seb thought it was better to starve.
Seb folded Mandri’s arms over his sweating chest so that the boy didn’t look so much like he was dead. That ended up making Mandri look more like a corpse, arms crossed over like that, so Seb undid the arms and sighed.
Should he cross the boy’s arms, or shouldn’t he?
This arms-crossing business was indicative of a deeper problem. If whatever he does is what he was meant to do, then why worry about it?
He worried because he couldn’t help himself. Whatever he did was what he was meant to do, and that included worrying about what he was meant to do.
What worried him most was that he could do nothing—never speak, never move, never feel—and that, too, would be what he was supposed to do. He could kill his body and that would be right, even though it was wrong. It was a damned if he did, damned if he did situation. There was no room in it for reason.
He took a deep breath.
He thought about licking a slice of burgeon.
Just one lick. Maybe one drop on the tip of the tongue.
He knew he shouldn’t, because Pell would be here soon.
But what if he did?
If he did, then that’s what was supposed to happen, and Pell couldn’t be mad about that.
She would be mad, but she shouldn’t be.
If she were mad, that was fine, too. And he couldn’t be mad about her getting mad. Unless he did get mad.
He sighed again.
He sat back down in the blackwood chair and leaned back as far as it allowed, which wasn’t far at all. He let his eyelids droop and tried to empty his thoughts as he stared into the fire.
Be nothing, like a rock is nothing.
Think about nothing 
Don’t think about nothing—have no thoughts.
And avoid, at all costs, those bubbling expectations. 
He began to hum. Humming helped to push the threat of thought into his mind’s crowded periphery.
“MMMMmmmmmmm…”
“MMMmmmmm…”
“MMMMMmmmmm…”
Seb stayed that way in front of the fire, humming like a lizard in heat, almost as lost in the sauce of nothingness as Mandri was, and just as he began to nod asleep, an old woman’s voice echoed into the cave.
“My troubled Seb,” the voice said. “What troubles my troubled Seb?”
Seb twisted around in his chair. A tall, old woman was standing in front of a slit of the rock wall  which had not been there before. Her thin frame was draped in a black curtain of a robe, and a ruffled shawl framed her face neatly. Her face was well-worn, stern and austere, but to Seb it was full of beauty.
“Well?” she asked. “What has so enthralled the mind of Seb?”
Seb jumped out of his chair and cast himself down at her feet. His forehead bumped hard on the rock. “Nothin’, my lady. I wasn’t thinkin’ of nothin’.”
“Mm-hmm.”
Pell’s voice had a way of benevolence, even when she was suspicious—especially when she was suspicious, for she delighted in being deceived.
“And I see you’ve found young Mandrameen.”
“Yes.”
“I’m surprised he’s made it this far. You should have seen his face when I swallowed his Ox’s spark. Salavan was convinced he was useless.”
She stepped around Seb, as graceful as the wind, and her gentle hand came to rest upon his shoulder. All the tension in his body evaporated, and he gasped.
“That’s better, isn’t it?” she said. Her voice could soothe the hardest Spark.
She walked behind him, to where Mandri lay. Though Seb could not see her, he knew her gaze was set on the boy and he grew jealous.
“I found him dead in the Junei hills,” he said.
“I know,” said Pell. 
“I been your faithful man.”
Pell chuckled. “Seb, Seb, Seb,” she sang with a doting swerve.
Seb felt her fingers alight upon his back again and he shivered. She began to knead his muscle with a practiced care.
“My child,” she said, “It’s been too long.”
Seb melted under her touch. Her hands pushed and spread his muscles like dough over his spine and ribs, and she built the pressure in waves, a rising tide of tenderness. 
Pell said, “Your faith warrants a boon. Ask and you shall receive.”
Seb bit his lip.
“I wish to see as you see.”
Pell stopped with a sudden jerk, and the warmth that he’d been feeling was snuffed out.
“You know that gift is not for you.”
Seb’s eyes welled up with tears.
“I know it, but…”
“Watch,” Pell said. “I want you to watch this.”
Seb scuttled around on all fours to face her. He lifted his eyes, and there she was, kneeling next to Mandri’s head. She was not looking at the boy, she was looking at Seb, but not just him, for her sight could penetrate right through his Self and see inside his Spark. In her hand was a near empty vial of a shimmering, iridescent fluid—the last few tears of Schisol.
“This is not for you,” she said.
Seb wanted to arch his neck and scream about unfairness, and reading his mind, Pell answered, “Would you know what to do with it?”
Seb lowered his eyes again in reverence. Pell was right. She was always right, though that didn’t make him feel any better. He wanted to smash his skull against the rock, and when he heard the pop of the vial’s cork he almost did it.
“Schisol will be here soon,” Pell said after administering one of Schisol’s tears  to each of Mandri’s eyes. “And when he comes, you will have your chance. But until that day, you will have to settle for my blessing.”
She reached across Mandri’s body and lifted Seb’s chin with her graceful finger, and he looked into her warm eyes. He could see her true nature in those eyes, for her crone’s nose and aged skin belied an unfathomable beauty.
The truth was in her eyes.
The truth was in her kiss.
The touch of her lips upon his forehead filled him with amazement, for she had implanted a warmth that spread through him like a wave, radiating out until every single inch of him was enveloped in a loving embrace. What she chased out was loneliness. What she undid was the knot in his stomach he never could untie. Only her kiss could do this. Only Schisol, through her, could better him—and for the briefest moment, an exalted breath, he felt truly whole. He could not contain his wonder, and his dirty cheeks ran wet with tears.
“Feel better?” she asked.
“Yes.”
The moment Pell removed her finger from his chin, the spell was broken. Seb returned his head to the floor where it belonged. The chill of the stone was startling. Like the come-down from the God’s Eye burgeon, the same-old Seb flooded in. He would have wept again if it weren’t for his lady’s aura of resolve.
 He heard her sit down in the chair, the fabric squeaking tight against its wooden frame.
“Did you sit in my chair?” she asked.
“Yes,” he said. “I’m sorry. I was tired.”
“That’s no excuse. I worry about you, Seb. You are like a weed. Every time I pull you out of your body, you grow right back.”
“I’m sorry…I’m weak, I know it. I understand, if…if…I know Schisol will come with or without me. If I did nothin’, He would still come.”
“Seb…”
Seb’s shoulders sank as she reached down and caressed his neck.
“Have you ever seen a play?” she asked.
“No.”
“Do you know what a play is?”
Seb nodded, forehead scraping on the rock.
“The actor’s lines are already written,” she said. “Some plays are quite old, written more than a thousand years ago, yet the actors still speak their lines exactly as provided. Like puppets, they speak them, and do you know why they do it?”
Seb shook his head slowly, hoping the drift of his chin would look like contemplation.
“They do it,” Pell said, “Because that’s what they want to do.”
She paused to let the words sink in, and in case they didn’t, she added, “Do you do what you want to do?”
“Yes.”
“Good. That’s all that I ask of you.”  She settled back into her chair. “Now tell me what the Ayramun are up to.”
“They captured a Mazid.”
“I’ve learned that much.”
“They want to use the Mazid to hunt the Amalgamete.”
“As expected. And they shall all perish.”
“Ayram don’t seem to think so.”
“I don’t care what the brute thinks—Elrahet is the one that sees. Is she optimistic?”
“Elrahet don’t speak to me…I try, and I try, and I try, but she don’t speak.”
“Has she said nothing about Mazidfire?”
“Nothin’.”
Seb felt compelled to share some hopeful news. “The Hrks have these things called Riga which can hunt a Mazid down to the ends of the earth. These Riga are children—it’s horrible what they do the Spark.”
“Yes, I know of them.”
“But these Riga can track the Mazid from anywhere. They’ll catch the Ayramun before they ever reach the Bullr bones.”
The fire crackled, and Pell settled deeper into her chair. She crossed legs and set her free foot bobbing up and down. She mused, “What does Elrah see?”
“I think it would be best,” she said, “If we don’t let them reach the bones of Bullr. She has strength there, which needlessly complicates things. We need them to approach Shulgi from the south.”
“Of course.”
“Because Elrahet is up to something. I can feel it. I can almost see it. She’s rarely ever been so reckless. Has she spoke of the boy at all?”
“Mandri? No. But she does not talk to me.”
Seb cringed in embarrassment.
Pell let loose a deep sigh. “The threads would have been simpler if they never captured that abominable Mazid.”
Seb whined and fought back against the urge to confess his role in the Mazid’s capture.
“What I want you to do, Seb, is convince Ayram to change his plans. Have him head further south for the Goree Pass.”
“Why the Goree?”
“Do you need to understand?”
“No. No…but Ayram won’t listen to me. Not on somethin’ like that. He barely listens to Elrahet. Going to the Goree would add two days of walkin’ for no gain.”
“I will help with that. You plant the seed in that barren skull of his, and I will make it blossom.”
“What about the boy?”
“What of him?”
“What if dies in the Goree?”
“If he dies, then he dies.”
Seb winced at his own stupidity—of course that’s how it was. And yet he knew that wouldn’t be how it ended, for Pell would never waste one of Schisol’s tears on someone who was not worthy of it.
“Seb, You are precious,” Pell cooed. “In all my life I’ve never had a servant such as you, so close to the enemy. But even so, I wonder, are you afraid to die?”
Seb knew she was looking at him by the way her voice carried to his ear, and if she were looking at him she could read every quiver in his body and would know if he were lying. So he told the truth.
“Yes,” he said. The word came out with a sob.
“Now, now,” Pell said, trying to comfort him. “You’ve done more for Schisol than almost every other person who has ever lived. You are special, Seb. Should I say it again? You are special.”
“I don’t feel it.”
“That’s what makes you special,” she said, brimming with earnest concern. “Your hatred for yourself is a subtle righteousness. And you know this, don’t you? You know that all of this is a mistake, that we all belong together. That is why you are who you are—no one else would do. Only you could be right here, right now. So give thanks, Seb, and be happy. You could have been one of the nameless number doomed to be severed from the Whole.” 
Nothing Seb could say or do could express the extent to which he appreciated these words, so he stayed low and prostrated himself further, then whispered a prayer to Schisol, thanking Him for His generosity.
Pell was contented to hear it.
“Now,” she said. “I have a storm to summon.”
She walked over to the cavern slit and whistled. Her whistle awoke something in the darkness there, something which Seb could not see but he could hear—an ominous thumping echo marching towards the room. Then came a grumbling growl, then a belly-rumbling snort, and then the scratching swish of a giant lizard’s tail dragging against the rock.
The snout that pierced the veil of darkness near Pell’s hip was red as red can be. It swayed from side to side, forked-tongue licking the air.
“Come on out,” Pell said with a wondrous smile, as if she were talking to a child. 
The lizard’s bloody red head swung into the room. Its wide skull was nearly as long as Seb’s arm, and its slitted orange eyes were sunk behind an angry ridged brow. Whatever teeth it had were hidden under jowls, but Seb knew what they looked like, for this was a man-eater, a juvenile keenkedra. Everyone on the Jandri continent knew a keenkedra’s teeth—short stubby fangs that were barely there because if they were any longer that would make it harder for the beast to swallow a wriggling man whole.
Aside from its dietary habits, the keenkedra were known for their size, their rich red color, and their characteristic short-armed shuffle. The crook of this particular lizard’s back came up to Pell’s waist—if it were an adult it would not have been able to squeeze into the room.
Pell gave it a friendly brush with the back of her knuckles, and the creature stopped beside her and nuzzled up against her leg. It raised its stiff neck for a good old scratch, which Pell was happy to provide. Her magic managed to coax a low humming growl of contentment. Seb thought he saw a smile. Then suddenly, the beast was looking at him, bearing an expression akin to alarm, as if the creature had only now noticed Seb’s existence.
“Move the boy out of the way,” Pell said, and Seb did as she commanded, careful to make no sudden movements. Then Pell led the beast further into the room and she lay it down, belly facing the fire. Its stubby tail was thumping excitement against the floor. 
 Seb marveled at Pell’s control. Elrahet could only dream of conjuring up such a beast for sacrifice, and even then she’d have trouble with flailing limbs. Pell’s lizard didn’t flinch an inch  when Pell drew her knife and stabbed its gut. It merely sighed as she thrust her arm right into its stomach and felt around for its Spark.
The storm this sacrifice would conjure would be enormous.</Text>

She said, “If you want to know, then you need to go and see Him for yourself.”
“See Solraheen?”
She nodded.
“You’ve seen Him?”
She nodded again.
“The Hrks let you into His chamber?”
“Not exactly,” she said through sly side-smile. “His chamber is filled with saffee leaf smoke. It’s a bonfire that burns all day and night. Think about how much effort that would take. How many trees you would need.”
“A lot.”
“The Hrks diverted the Ganniket river to make it work. My great-grandfather’s tribe lived on the Ganniket.”
“I’m sorry to hear that.”
“The Hrks do all this to drug Solraheen so deeply that He won’t see what they’re doing to His creation.”
“So you want Him to end the Hrk?”
“What Solraheen would want—what He would command if His mind were not unwound by those fumes—is for the Hrkan world to be set right. Only He can do this, so He must be freed.”
“Wouldn’t it make more sense to make sure that’s what Solraheen wants before you do it? I mean, if Solraheen wanted to be freed, He would free Himself.”
Purl heaved a tired sigh as if the answer to that question was so perfectly obvious and she couldn’t bear to explaining it again.
“And what about Schisol?” he asked.
“He will be destroyed.”
Her pronouncement was as certain as it was insane.
“And what makes you so sure it’s going to play out like that?”
“Because our cause is righteous.”
Mandri thanked the dark because if Purl had seen him smirk she might have punched him right in the nose with her stumpy arm. He gathered his wits and decided to see if he could poke a hole.
“Don’t you think that Solraheen believed His cause was righteous when He buried Himself and Schisol under all that Fabled Black?”
“Of course.”
“Solraheen is the most powerful of all the gods who ha ever lived. If His righteous cause ended up more trouble than it was worth, why do you think your righteous cause isn’t going to end up the same way?”
“You’re seeing it all wrong,” she said in a dismissive laugh. She began to explain, as if to a child, intoning her words with charm, “Solraheen’s cause was not finished when He called down the Fabled Black. It was only a link in a causal chain, which ends in us, in the Ayramun. Our cause is His cause.”
This was how every conversation with a zealot went. Poke a hole in their apocalyptic vision and they cover it up with some trite language play. Soon she’d be telling him what he should and shouldn’t do.</Text>

            <Title>Pit Cave</Title>
            <Text>The spitting, scrawny woman walking in front of Mandri, the one carrying the ‘unconscious’ Obo, her name was Seb. The man walking behind Mandri, the short and stout man whose bread wasn’t baked all the way through, his name was Hill, and according to Hill, their two names were the only two things that Mandri needed to know. Don’t bother with ‘why’, or ‘what’s going on’, or ‘I can’t see where I’m going’, the only thing that mattered was that Seb was in front, Hill was behind, and that was the way things were going to be. If Mandri did so much as breathe too loudly for Hill’s comfort, that was sufficient cause for an open handed smack on the back of the head.
Unfortunately, it was impossible for Mandri to avoid making noise because sound carried well in a rock-hewn tunnel, and Mandri’s once-dead-legs were as stiff as rods so every step begged a groan. Every bend of knee felt like a knife stabbing his thigh. Instead of striding through the dark like Hill wanted him to, Mandri shuffled through it on sensitive feet, doing what he could to avoid the trash that littered the floor, and that was hard to do too as well, because the tunnel was a dumping ground.
There was a horde of trash piled all the way up the low ceiling. It was not a place for unshod feet, for hidden in the shadows of the dancing torchlight were the picked-clean bones of small animals scattered amongst splintered balkanut which looked like shattered skulls.  Curved clay shards of wasted jars and all manner of organic waste was the worst of it. Mandri stepped in cold and gooey lumps of muck that glistened when it welled up in between his toes—he couldn’t figure what this substance was until Hill stepped in it, too.
“Black Spark, Seb! Was this you?” Hill was pointing down at a dark stain that soured the toe of his hard leather boot.
Seb shoved Mandri aside so she could get an eye on it.
“Course not,”she protested.
“Why can’t you shit in the hole like everyone else?” Hill challenged.
“It wasn’t me.”
“It’s always you.”
“It was Chopper.”
“It’s always you or Chopper, and since this shit is half green, that means it’s you.”
Seb turned a cold shoulder to Hill’s indignation, and she started off again into the dark. Hill nudged Mandri to follow.
“Don’t play blame games with me,” Seb said as she adjusted Obo’s dead weight on her shoulder. “Who’s the one pilin’ up all this trash in here, huh? Ya know there’s a hole for all this, too, but ya’ll too lazy. Get yourself together fore you come and pick on my habits.” 
Mandri followed along timidly, clutching his wounded right arm against his chest, lest it brush up against the fetid clutter and get infected. He searched the shadow-strewn ground for a clean edge of stone to scrape his shit-stained foot against, but found none. The tunnel was cramped tight with so much junk that the junk itself seemed part of the natural stone. In fact, not one bit of stone could be seen in the flickering torchlight, not even on the low ceiling, for that was mottled over in gray-green moldy growths. All in all it was a loathsome place, and with each step Mandri became more and more convinced that he was back in the good old land of the living, because this was life in all its slovenly, pack-rat glory. Seb picked her way around all this junk as if she’d placed each piece herself, like a pampered toddler wading through scattered toys. On her shoulder, slung like a freshly slaughtered sty-pig, was Obo. His unfortunate nose bobbed in and out of Seb’s armpit with every step.
 It was hard to believe anyone could bring a Mazid down so low, and that these two boorish bandits were involved was inconceivable. Seb herself was as unimposing as an outland poke could be, dirty and hungry looking, with sunken eyes. She looked like desperation itself, and not the dangerous kind of desperation either. She was that sad kind of desperation that Mandri could defeat by simply looking away.
Mandri looked behind at Hill. Hill had his plump pinky finger stuck halfway up his own nose, digging for gold.
Mandri grimaced. “Leave some for me,” he joked.
Hill 's eyes flashed, his cheeks flushed, and he gave Mandri an uncivil punch in the ribs.
“Get going!” he shouted, and Mandri got going. He took two steps, and when that wasn’t hurried enough, Hill shoved him in the back as if that would help. Mandri’s stiff legs couldn’t cope with this crude encouragement and he tumbled forward into Seb’s hips. Then Seb went sprawling, too, and so did Obo. The three of them tumbled together into the glinting darkness.
“You gutwipe!” Seb shouted at Hill.
She rolled over, for she’d landed right on top of Obo. Hill rushed over and spread his torchlight upon the Mazid’s limp form. He studied the Obo’s limbs for breaks and scrapes. The scar on Obo’s chest had popped another stitch.
“Can’t trust you with a feather,” he said to Seb before picking Obo up under his arm. He gestured towards Mandri with his torch. “Take the little dent out to the pit,” he commanded. Then he marched on and disappeared into a sidelong passage, taking his torchlight with him.
“Dark Sparked taker,” Seb muttered after him.
Mandri was sad to see Hill go, as now he was alone with a pokey woman who was grumbling curses in pitch black dark. A hiss and a robe-swish later, and he felt the cold iron point of a dagger prodding his back.
“Don’t you think about tryin’ nothin’ stupid,” Seb said.
“I won’t.”
“What’d I say about talkin’? Now stand up and get movin’.”
Mandri stood up and started to move in the direction he supposed Seb’s dagger wanted him to go. The two of them walked  for a spell, bumbling through the dark, toes and knees knocking into whatever happened to be in their way. Eventually they rounded a bend and came to yet another tunnel, one which gave way to the blinding light of day. It wasn’t far, and when they finally emerged into the sunlight’s warmth, Mandri couldn’t see a thing through the burned in image of day.
Seb’s dagger relented, and Mandri’s aching legs took the opportunity to collapse. Instead of slamming into rock, his knees splashed into warm, soothing sand.
He dug his good hand into it.
It was warm and inviting.
He wanted to wriggle into it like a sand flea.
“Where’s Ayram!?” Seb shouted.
“In the cave,” said a gruff voice. 
“Where in the cave?”
“Inside.”
Seb exclaimed her disdain with a click of her tongue, and she darted back into the dark.
Mandri tried to blink out the bright white blotch of day, but that blotch only faded into a fainter blotch of white. He looked up, and instead of a wide blue sky there was a circle of blue encased in white. A few blinks more, and that whiteness resolved into a circling escarpment of white stone rock. He was sitting at the bottom of a colossal limestone bucket, a pit cave, with walls some fifty feet tall. The prenoon sun angled its light down the sides of the bucket, leaving Mandri’s half of the pit in a dusty, radiant glow, and the other half in a crescent shadow warmed orange from the sand’s reflected light.
There were dark figures milling about in that warm shadow on the opposite side, some standing, some sitting. They were all looking at him.
One of them stepped forward into the sunlight—a dark Zosan girl. Her smooth face was framed by a tight white headscarf, with the unwrapped end hanging loose around the neck. The rest of her figure was shrouded to the ankles by a beige robe. It was a clean and simple look, and despite the wear and tear that spoke of a life roughing it out in the Sand, the woman wore it all with a hint of regal bearing, shoulders held in a kind of self-important swoop that showed she’d been trained in the art of woman-standing-still. 
“You’re the dead boy,” she said. Her voice was as uncompromising as her posture, though she wasn’t much older than Mandri. And while her statement was a simple matter of fact, the way she said it suggested it was some keen insight obvious only to her. 
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. He was anxious to not appear ruffled. He sat back on his heels and contemplated standing up but decided against it because he wasn’t sure if his legs could manage it.
“Don’t speak without permission,” she said as she wrinkled her nose. He supposed she could smell rot on him. “I am Moteah.”
“I’m Mandri.”
“Don’t speak.”
“Sorry.”
Moteah huffed at this final barb, then turned to the scraggly men and women behind her, and said, “Someone get the boy fit for walking. And make sure he doesn’t speak.” Then she walked into caves.
“Get him fit for a dog’s dick,” said a grumbling voice.
“Shut up, Weeg.”
“You shut up.”
“No one’s to mess with the boy until Ayram’s sussed him out.”
The woman who’d come to Mandri’s defense was a silver-haired Jandri poke, athletic, wearing a fitted brown robe with a choking neckline ornamented by knotted leather tassels the length of fingers. This robe, combined with her sun-leathered skin and general greasiness, made her seem like an overgrown taproot come to life. 
“My name’s Forty,” she said. “And you’re Mandri?”
Mandri nodded.
“You can speak,” Forty said, amused. She then turned around and chided the shadows. “I shouldn’t have to say this, but things being what they are—no one touches a hair on this prick’s head unless Ayram says so.”
A few unhappy grunts followed.
“Now, Who’s got Papi’s clothes?”
When no one answered, Forty pointed towards Mandri with an open hand and said, “The boy needs robes before we set out and Papi’s will fit. So, who’s got ‘em?”
“Papi’s not been dead two days,” said one unhappy shadow.
“So? Do you think Papi cares what happens to his clothes?”
“I care.”
“Did you take his clothes, then, Weeg?”
“No.”
“Who did?”
“Tob did.”
Forty turned to a lounging man tucked right inside the bottom swerve of the pit’s crescent shadow. She motioned for Mandri to follow her across the pit and into the shade, and as she sauntered towards this burly fellow he stretched out amongst a couple of burlap sacks, claiming them all with his splayed out arms and legs. Between the man’s beard, brows, and hair there was hardly a splotch of skin on him. There was a mouth on his head somewhere, because sticking out of the beard was a fat, stubby pipe. The smoke swirling out of it stank of freeweed. 
Mandri nodded at this wiry black bush, but it didn’t nod back. Instead it said, “The bastard can freeze and burn for all I care.”
“This is Tob,” said Forty, as she sat down next to the man.
Mandri nodded again.
Tob grunted.
“Tob is an idiot.”
“And Forty’s dried-up,” Tob retorted.
Forty pointed to the bundle of clothes that lay between Tob’s elbow and armpit. “Are those Papi’s clothes?”.
Tob rolled onto his side and patted the bundle with care. “They are. Make a nice pillow, don’t they?”
“Let’s have them.”
“The only way the boy here is getting them is if Ayram commands it.”
“Give them here,” said Forty, undeterred. 
“Woman—what did I just say?”
“You want to explain to Ayram why the boy isn’t ready to walk?”
Tob took a thoughtful drag from his pipe. He held the smoke captive in his barrel chest for a long moment, and the exhale, when it came, was a sheepish attempt to obscure a reluctant, “No.”
Forty pulled the bundle of clothes out from under Tob’s bushy bulk. She tossed it to Mandri as Tob grumbled, “Last I checked we was called the Ayramun, not the Fortyun.”
“Never said we was called anything else.”
Mandri picked at the troublesome knot which kept the outfit wrapped tight, and Tob was clear to stress, “You need be remembering who those clothes belong to. They’re Ayram’s. Everything is Ayram’s here. Clothes on my back. Those clothes there. The food that’s coming to your belly. It’s all loaned out, if you like. Everything’s Ayram’s. Not yours. Not Moteah’s. And not Forty’s either. So don’t get confused by the way the women act.”
Mandri finally pulled the plaited hemp string free, and unrolled the apparel onto the ground. There was a thickish brown, three-layered robe all crumpled up with salt and sweat, and next to it was a simple hoodscarf, brown as well. The dead Papi had no eye for flair, though that suited Mandri just fine. There was also a pair of rawhide boots that, when Mandri put them on, seemed cut perfectly to size. It was all in good shape, too, though the robe was loosely-fit and had a blood stain around the collar and a long splotch of blood running down the left arm as well. In putting it on, Mandri was careful not to stain the right sleeve with his poultice-wrapped wrist, which at this point was leaking a dark, almost black, ooze.
When Mandri finally had it all on, with the tails of the hoodscarf wrapped clumsily around his neck, he felt transformed. He was as pokey as the rest of them.
Tob looked him up and down. “That’s what Papi wore when he got killed.”
“Yeah, I figured.”
“You’re not supposed to speak,” said Tob as he blew a puff of smoke in Mandri’s direction.
“Can I ask why not?”
A gruff voice rose up from the shadows behind. “Cause you a damned Minder, you dent.”
The charge had come from Weeg. Weeg was a dirty and disheveled man who looked like he’d rolled down a dune. Sand was stuck to his unreasonably flat and blocky face. His nose was a bulbous root—must have been broken a time or three.
“Pull off him,” Forty said. “It doesn’t matter if he talks. Not like the Mazid’s out here anyways. And look at him—not like he knows any curses.”
Mandri looked down at his bloodstained sleeve. “If you don’t want me wearing these robes, I don’t need to. I’m fine with just my tunic.”
“Won’t be fine when we head out into the Sand,” said Forty, chuckling. “That skimpy tunic would leave your legs in boils.”
“Hell of a lot wrong with Papi’s robes too,” said Tob. “Them robe’s weave is bad luck—the warp to weft is three to one.”
“Don’t start,” said Forty.
“This ain’t a matter of startin’ and stoppin’. A three to one weave is plain bad luck. That’s how it is.”
Forty groaned and Tob’s caterpillar brow jumped at Mandri. “Women don’t know about luck, do they? Course, you don’t know about it either, do you?”
Mandri shrugged and said, “I feel a little bit lucky. I mean, I’m alive, aren’t I? Couple of fingers ago I thought I was dead.”
“Oh, you weren’t dead,” Tob said emphatically. “You were body dead, sure, but your Spark was still burning.”
“How’s that?”
“Think I know? Don’t ask me about witch business. All I know is when a person gets body-dead but their stomach’s still burns, that only means one thing.” He paused and supped his pipe to savor the anticipation on Mandri’s face.
Forty pooed the man’s slackness and finished the thought. “We found you body-dead in the Junei hills, dressed up as food for the Amalgamete.”
Mandri blanched as Tob puffed out a snot of smoke right at him. “And there’s only one thing the Amalgamete’s stomach do with its food, and that’s make demons.”
“Demons?” Mandri wondered.
Tob’s beady eyes livened up. “That’s right. You woulda been made a demon. Now, you might think that it’s lucky that you didn’t get ate, but look what’s happened, you got found by a witch that reads the future, and that future said, ‘This bastard is gonna have to lose his hand and lose his mind to a Mazid’, and that’s just as bad. Bad, bad luck.”
“Bad luck on him means bad luck on us,” said Weeg, from behind. “I’ll tell you all, Elrahet been readin’ the future upside down. That boy there is a curse. Sun as my light, that boy there is gonna get us all killed.”
“That so?” Tob asked.
“It’s so. I saw that boy fall out of that damned corpsecart we was ambushin’. An’ look what happened—more n’ half of us dead.”
Forty intervened again. “We were dealing with a Mazid and eighty something Skulsi. We were always gonna lose people. This little prick had nothing to do with it.”
Weeg scrunched up his ruined nose, it gave a buckling-crack as the cartilage snapped into a painful sneer. He said, “Woulda been less dead if it weren’t such a shitshow, and you tell me, how’d things go down that way?”
“I’ll tell you,” said Tob.
Forty rolled her eyes and said derisively, “Let me guess—we got unlucky?”
“Damn right. And there’s things you need to know about Luck. Luck is like peelin’ plaster, you have to—”
Forty interrupted with a mule-like whine. “Tob,” she said, “You're the unluckiest bastard in the world. You don’t know shit about luck.” She looked to Mandri through tired eyes and added, “He hides his face in all that hair cause he’s so damned ugly. And guess how he got those scars. The man got his head chewed up by a keenkedra.”
“But I survived!” Tob exclaimed. “Who touched tongues with a full-grown keenki and lived to tell about it? No one! None but me. And why? Because of my luck.”
“You’re lucky you survived, but you were as unlucky as a Hrkan prick to ever get swallowed in the first place.”
“That’s the thing!” Tob exclaimed, almost shouting. His left eye was wide with excitement, revealing to Mandri that under all that hair the right side of his face was paralyzed. Something like that is usually obvious from the way the lips skew when a person speaks, but Tob’s mouth was little more than a hole in the black broom that was his beard, and while that hole did skew, the right side had an excuse for not moving as it was busy clenching his pipe.
“You need some bad luck to really know about luck,” said Tob. “It’s the always-lucky that don’t know a thing about luck because they don’t need to. They don’t step in any holes and they get to believin’ that holes don’t exist. But I’ve stepped in all the holes. I know my way around them by now. I’ve got Luck mapped out as well as anybody who ever lived.”
“That don’t make sense.”
Tob shrugged Forty off and stayed steady on Mandri. “If I shoot an arrow at you, what says whether or not it kills you?”
“Luck?” Mandri asked.
Forty cut in again, saying, “Luck has nothing to do with it. It’s skill.”
“It’s luck!” Tob retorted. “Skill says whether or not you hit the target. You aim at the neck, and if you’re skilled, you hit the neck. Luck says whether it rips through the pipes or only scratches the throat.” As proof of his words, Tob pulled up his beard to reveal, lurking under a scraggle of neck hair, a long white scar that wrapped around his throat.
“Looks like someone tried to chop your head off,” said Mandri.
A shorter, stunted, bald man who’d been snoozing away perked up and shouted, “Chop!?”
All eyes turned to this man, alarmed, and Tob was quick to shout back “No!”, with expressive hands. “No chop. No chop today.” 
“Chop?” the bald man asked again, disappointed.
“No chop,” Tob repeated.
The bald man pouted and lay back down. As soon his head hit his pack of a pillow he was snoozing again.
Tob sighed and said to Mandri, “Don’t say that word around Chopper unless you need something cut. And if you need something cut you better find him and let him do it—or else. Anyways, like I was sayin’, the arrow that did my neck was shot from only twenty paces. Busted right through me. And that arrow came from a Scweeman no less—as skilled as any here with a bow. But he couldn’t beat my luck. I’d wager more than money that my good luck is what saved me.”
“He says that, but he won’t ever actually wager anything,” Forty snipped.
“Because it’s not right for me to take advantage of others in matters of luck.”
“What about a wager on him?” asked the gruff Weeg, pointing a hateful finger at Mandri. “I bet ten wraps this walkin’ curse is gonna get us all killed.”
Forty cracked a wry smile. “If we’re all killed, then how are you gonna come and collect?”
“I bet twenty!” said Weeg.  “Why’d Elrahet make him Minder anyways?”
“I didn’t hear you volunteer.”
“You didn’t either.”
“But I’m not complaining, am I?”
“You should! Makin’ a fresh pulled poke Minder of a Mazid weren’t never part of the plan. Who says he ain’t gonna turn the Mazid on us and roast us all in golden fire?”
“Elrahet says it,” was Forty’s reply, and somehow that was enough to end the argument. Weeg sneered for the sake of it, baring his crooked yellow teeth, but after that he settled down, but not before getting in a final barb. “Can’t trust a fresh pulled poke to keep the piss out their pants.”
Forty rolled her eyes, and Mandri took the opportunity to rest his aching legs by sitting down next to her, for she seemed to be the only person who would tolerate him. 
“Better get used to waiting,” she said. “It’s half of what we do around here.”
Tob overheard and added, “Welcome to the Ayramun.”
From then on, they sat and waited in that crescent shadow in silence. This gave Mandri time to think about how this ragged band of sand-spitting pokes had killed eighty-something Skulsi and captured a Mazid. On top of that, for some god-bothering reason, they’d found Mandri’s body and had brought him back to life just to make him the Mazid’s Minder.
Why?
Only Solraheen knew. Only Solraheen  and some old bat named Elrahet. Since Solraheen was dead, that left Elrahet.
Probably this Ayram knew as well, whoever he was.
Mandri sat and waited for one of them to make an entrance.</Text>

 “You killed it!” Seb exclaimed.
“That was you! ” Hill countered. “Your skinny ass cracked its neck.”
Hill rushed over and picked the broken Mazid up under his arm. “You done it now, Seb. You done it now.”
Seb laughed. “Yeah, like Ayram’s gonna believe you. hopped up and grabbed Mazid’s arm. “I’ll carry it,” she growled.

            <Text>This is as far as principles take us. The next step is to frame hypotheses. I propose three hypotheses about what lies beyond spacetime and beyond the quantum: Time, in the sense of causation, is fundamental. This means the process by which future events are produced from present events, called causation, is fundamental. Time is irreversible. The process by which future events are created from present events can’t go backward. Once an event has happened, it can’t be made to un-happen.* Space is emergent. There is no space, fundamentally. There are events and they cause other events, so there are causal relations. These events make up a network of relationships. Space arises as a coarse-grained and approximate description of the network of relationships between events. This means that locality is emergent. Nonlocality must then also be emergent. If locality is not absolute, if it is the contingent result of dynamics, it will have defects and exceptions. And indeed, this appears to be the case: how else are we to understand quantum nonlocality, particularly nonlocal entanglement? These, I would hypothesize, are remnants of the spaceless relations inherent in the primordial stage, before space emerges. Thus, by positing that space is emergent we gain a possibility of explaining quantum nonlocality as a consequence of defects which arise in that emergence. The combination of a fundamental time and an emergent space implies that there may be a fundamental simultaneity. At a deeper level, in which space disappears but time persists, a universal meaning can be given to the concept of now. If time is more fundamental than space, then during the primordial stage, in which space is dissolved into a network of relations, time is global and universal. Relationalism, in the form in which time is real and space is emergent, is the resolution of the conflict between realism and relativity. Let’s give a name to this version of relationalism, which emphasizes the reality and irreversibility of time and the fundamentality of the flow of present moments. Let’s call it temporal relationalism. We can contrast it with eternalist relationalism, which investigates the hypothesis that space is fundamental, but time is emergent.Reference: https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/time-is-fundamental.972906/

            <Text>Until now, Mandri had only seen paintings—a wall of sand rendered in lurid reds and purples reaching to the heavens, its face lit up by jagged spears of lightning. Twisting funnels swept the land before it, harbingers of its destruction, and in the foreground, a sympathetic figure—a human, or a lonely, trembling tree—whose only purpose was to accentuate the sheer scale of the monster about to swallow it.

Purl was sitting next to Moteah’s rock. She sat hunched against her knees, taking in the wind, squinting as she did. Her tangled mess of sun-kissed hair blew past her shoulders to reveal the smallest set of ears. And hers was a face that suggested deep and penetrating thought, though Mandri knew from experience that such faces were almost always lying.
“What are you thinking about?” Mandri asked her.
“I’m thinking of all the ways that this is going to go wrong,” she said.
“Well, I hope I’m not the cause of any of those.”
“You aren’t,” she said, and somehow that stung him, even though it was perfectly true.
“Anyone else hungry?” Mandri asked.
“There’s hardtack in my bag,” said Moteah, glancing back down at the temple.
“Do you have anything green?”
“Green? Like what?”
“I don’t know. I’m in the mood for something pulled out of the earth.”
“Do you see a single sprig of green in all of that?”
She was pointing to the world at large, and of course, there wasn’t a speck of green in any of it.

“No, you’re not, because lesson number three involves swinging your sword and thinking while you do it, and your mind is as undeveloped as your arm. Now we don’t have time to strengthen either, so we’ve got to be smart about how we practice. So let’s get you thinking. First—your goal. You and I are about to duel. What is it, in specific terms, you are trying to do?”

“Be specific. What specifically are you going to do to achieve that? Most blows to the body don’t kill quickly. There’s only a few reliable spots that will end a fight right away. The heart,” He pounded his chest. “And the head.” He tapped his headwrap with the blunt edge of his sword. “If you stick a Skulsi in the arm, then you’ve failed to kill him quickly, and now he’s free to have his way with you. Half a Skulsi’s training goes into figuring out all the different ways to get back at an enemy who’s in the process of killing him. He knows that if you cut him down this way or that, sword or spear, what’s the best thing to do to get you back. The Hrks can afford to think like that. They can afford one-for-one trades.”
“Hrk can afford twenty-for-one trades,” said Obo.
“The fact is,” Moto said, annoyed at being interrupted. “When fighting a Skulsi man you have to wound him, and then get out of his way.” To illustrate the point he cut a dramatic swath out of the air and then jumped away from it. “You take what your opponent gives you. What they give you is their sword arm.”
“I see,” Mandri said as he gave his sword a clumsy swing.
“This is what using your mind feels like, Mandri. I know this is a lot to take in, but these things need to be rolling around in your head, because when the time comes, you’ll see, you’ll remember it. Focus on the key thing—attack the sword arm.” He raised his sword arm and gave the wind another few dramatic hacks, and he seemed extremely proud of all the air he’d just slaughtered.

Moto’s face scrunched up, then softened as he remembered, “That’s right—you said you were a painter. Who’s the best painter then?”
“You wouldn’t know him.”
“I wouldn’t know him? A thought-stopper like that is the sign of a fool. Make an argument that we can work through, or do not speak at all.”
“You’re the one that thinks killing is an artform. You are insane.”
“Have you ever killed anyone, Mandri?”
“No. But I’ve seen enough of killing to know it’s nothing but a rude bunch of scuffling around until someone gets stabbed and dies.”

“Whatever.”
“Don’t whatever me, boy. If you knew who you were talking to you’d be—”
“I’ve seen you fight. At Minting Rock. It seemed like you were having a tough time of it.”
Moto jaw went slack at the accusation, but he recovered nicely, saying, “That wasn’t a fight, I was defending myself from superior numbers.”
“Ayram seemed to think it was a fight.”
“Ayram has a superior weapon.”
“Is that all he has?” Mandri asked in jest. Obo was chuckling, and Obo hadn’t even seen the battle at Minting Rock. Moto was just that deluded.

He asked Obo, “How long do you think I could last up there?”
“You might be able to last a hand or two, but the storm is still building.”
Mandri stepped up to the ladder. 
“I just want to see what it feels like.”
“It will feel like torture.”
Mandri left Obo’s warning on the ground and kept climbing. When he got to the top, he stuck his hand up to test the fury of that orange glow. Sand blasted into  his palm and he hissed in pain.
He hobbled back down, staring at his prickled hand. Tiny red welts dotted it all over, some of their centers bleeding red. He sat back down and moaned, but he didn’t regret it.

            <Title>Deep Well</Title>
            <Text>The next morning they stumbled upon a deep well in the middle of nowhere. None present had ever seen it before, though Elrahet claimed to have seen it, only she had no memory of it.
Nobody challenged this incongruity.
But the well was huge, two-men wide, and included a full set of stairs zig-zagging down to the bottom, some fifty yards deep. There was a bucket, and Moto lowered it. The water he pulled up was salty and brackish, and there were fish in it. They were the ugliest little minnows that Mandri had ever seen—blind pink fish with pulpy membranes where there should have been eyes.
Moto gathered them up and cooked the lot of them in a stew.
It was not delicious.
Afterwards, Seb began an argument with her own damned self. She said, between squelching chews of borcandi spine, “If you take a barrel full o’ water and put a livin’ fish in it, the water overflows, but if you put a dead fish in it, the water don’t overflow.”
She claimed this implied something or other about the Spark, but then she immediately discounted it, and she went on like this for half a hand until Obo asked the woman if she’d ever actually put a dead fish into a barrel of water. Seb said she hadn’t, so she filled a bowl with water, put a dead fish in it, and found that water overflowed.
She did not know what to make of this.</Text>

            <Text>Under his feet were holes burrowed by some strange species of yellow-headed lizard. At night those lizards escaped from their haunts and searched for food. He could see them silhouetted against the starry sky. Their mounds were covered with picked cleaned bones of all manner of mouse, lizard, ground-nesting birds, and berrybush stems.
He wondered if these lizard mounds had once been cities. There were lizard mounds lining to the horizon, and beyond that to the ends of the world.
A distant lizard sent forth a screaming hiss into the night. Other lizards from other lizard cities immediately took up his challenge, and for a good few hands the peace of the starry sky was upset by the hissing, hacking, crying foul of yellow headed brats. </Text>

            <Title>Shis</Title>
            <Text>Sheldruub is the Old Jandri word for the final stage of rebirth, characterized by a staticky prickling at the edge of the mind. It is the same word ascribed to the wild slosh of ocean foam that gets beached during a world storm. Such storms can blanket an entire coast six feet deep with salty pale-brown spume. When the storm eventually passes and the sun shines down, the air becomes saturated with the hiss of an uncountable number of bubbles popping through the course of days. The noise is not loud, it’s simply there and it is everywhere, a sound whose source can’t be placed and so it becomes something like the wind, a force of nature, hardly noticed except for when it disappears, and when it does there comes the sight and memory of solid ground—though the ground is not the same as it once was for the storm has ravaged it.
 Mandrameen didn’t notice the Sheldruub. He didn’t notice the feeling of his own blood pumping through his veins and tickling his insides. He didn’t notice these things because he was afraid, and he was afraid because his first rekindling thought was that he was dead and that this was the afterlife and that he was a cold corpse floating in a black void. The signs were unmistakable. His very bones felt frigid and his whole face was numb—if his face was there at all. There was the unmistakable putrescence of rotting flesh. Mandri knew the smell so well because when he was a child, rats frequently died underneath his tiled floor, and he’d have to endure the smell or sleep outside. The first night he slept outside, a spawn of gilt flies got to him. When he woke up, his whole left cheek was covered in hard red welts the size of fingernails, and since the other half had been safely nestled in his pillow he looked like he’d been slapped in the face by disease.
The smell of rot was always upsetting, especially now, because, presumably, that smell was coming from him.
And he could not move. Dead things do not move, therefore, he was dead.
Yet, he could breathe. His breath was icy coming out of his throat.
He tried again to move but neither his legs nor arms would bend. He wasn’t sure if he had legs or arms at all, for he couldn’t truly feel them—there was only a general chill where his legs and arms should be. As he was coming to terms with the idea that his mind had been decoupled from his flesh and that all these sensations were but phantom memories and that his consciousness was floating somewhere inside his decomposing corpse, his eyes opened. They didn’t open far for they’d been glued shut by the crust of death.
He was confronted with a low sandstone ceiling directly above him, a ceiling stained black with soot that flickered in a meager firelight. It was a natural stone, a familiar texture where the rocky surface was smooth, craggy, and porous all at once—a difficult thing to capture with a brush. It was a surface unmarred by the clawing rake of chisels, making it clear that this was no tomb, or mineshaft, or one of those rock-hewn hermit homes that pock the Hias. A cave such as this, Mandri surmised, could only mean that he had been borne down to Shis. 
He could not move his neck, but he could see that the cramped walls of his cave bulged out in places and disappeared into pitch-blackness in others.
Surely, this was Shis.
It didn’t quite match his expectations.
Mandri closed his eyes and conjured up an image of the dark earth riddled with pockets of air like this one, each one occupied by a waking corpse like him, each person forced to endure the mire of their own stench for an odd eternity. He found it pleasant. He wouldn’t be bothered in a place like that. There’d be no obligations. And since he was already dead, he didn’t have to worry about food.
He had full use of his neck. He looked down at his body and saw that he was wrapped tight in a brown woolen blanket, and he lay flat on a bed of straw. He thought it was strange for place such as Shis to provide simple comforts. He looked to his left, to the source of light in the middle of the floor, and was surprised to see that it wasn’t a tongue of fire piping up from the bowels of the earth. It was, instead, a small flame dancing on a thick wick which bathed in a shallow clay bowl of tallow. Its scant yellow light licked at a pale and naked creature who lay slumped on its side on the opposite end of the cave.
This pale creature was a humanlike, smaller than Mandri, and it huddled up against the rock. Its human anatomy was twisted into gangly proportions, and its skin was smooth and hairless, burnished to a gloss as if wet, streaked here and there by dark, crusted mud. It was so skinny that its stringy tendons were almost as large as its muscles. Its deeply furrowed ribs shuddered with its every breath. Its stomach was grossly distended, and its narrow shoulders were naturally hunched. Mandri supposed the creature was a ‘him’, but he wasn’t sure, for its groin was completely smooth and lacked any sign of gender. But ‘he’ and ‘she’ makes no difference when the subject in question was a demon—that’s what Mandri supposed it was. That’s the only possible thing it could be.
Despite the demon’s deformities, its face was smooth and fair, gaunt and ghoulish, replete with a serene expression couched in generic Hrkan features—thin lips and sad eyes, all in symmetrical and genderless proportion. And it was alive. Its gray eyes were studying a grievous wound afflicting its chest—a long line of crude, scabbed-up stitches ran up the middle of its sternum and bent over its heart. Two stitches nearer the sternum had burst, leaving a red-lipped slit that exposed gleaming bone.
Why a demon had met such abuse, Mandri was not sure. Perhaps this was a human half-transformed, still suffering through its long punishment. A cell-mate. A vision of what was in store for him.
Mandri had no doubt he would be tortured. And after the torture, there would come periods of healing, hence the stitching on the demon’s chest. This all made sense because Shis couldn’t be all torture all the time. There would need to be moments like this of healing to allow time for reflection. And no doubt the torture would fit the crimes he’d committed up on the surface. This creature here had committed a crime of passion. Why else would they cut out its heart? It also explained the erasure of its genitalia. This was a youth who succumbed to temptation.
And it was such a pitiful sight. It might have been frightful, but the creature didn’t seem capable of moving. It never even looked Mandri. Eventually it fell asleep, and when it did, Mandri felt at ease enough to lay back down and try to predict what style torture was in store for himself.
He thought long and hard about his crimes. He’d never committed any unshoulderable sins, nothing to warrant being impaled on a spike a thousand times or tossed into a lake of fire. People shamed him for giving up on life, but as far as he knew, that wasn’t explicitly forbidden. Who was he harming? No one. Harming himself? Nonsense. He was only trying to find a bit of peace. He found peace by losing himself in burgeons, sure, but if that was wrong then the blame was on whoever had created burgeons, and that was the gods.
He hadn’t killed himself, so there was that. He used to want to kill himself. He once told a Solitant priest his desire, and the man said he’d kill Mandri with a spoon if Mandri ever said anything like it again. That made as much sense as threatening to throw someone off a cliff after they’ve threatened to jump.
If Solraheen truly wanted to torture some purity back into Mandrameen’s Spark, the best way to do it would be to put him right back up there on the surface and surround him with people like that priest. Abusive old folk, violent assholes, the ignorant, the dumb, the vain people. People who don’t make sense—that’s everyone in general, really. Mandri didn’t discriminate when it came to hating people. He himself was a person.
Was self-hatred a crime against the Spark?
If it was, there could be only one punishment with any poetic significance—he would be made to hurt himself. Somehow, this place was going to get him to cut his own throat, or kick his own severed head into a hole. But he wasn’t some penitent pilgrim who took special delight in the cleansing awe of pain, so he’d need some prodding. He might be forced to ingest some mind-controlling substance, or be strapped into an ancient contraption of rust and iron, with knives, chains, and pulleys that could bend his arms against his will and make him flay himself. 
He tried to bend his arms, but he couldn’t. He did have arms wrapped under that brown blanket, for he could feel them now. Then he saw his fingertips sticking out from under a blanket fold, and like what happens in a dream, as soon as he saw them, feeling flooded into them. All at once, he had full use of his arms.
He wriggled around to loosen the blanket, and then pulled his left arm free. It was in remarkably good condition for a dead man’s arm. He tossed off the blanket and was surprised to find that his whole body was more or less how he’d left it. He was still wearing that white tunic foisted upon him by Salavan Soreen. Nothing was black and rotting as he’d expected, though he was much dirtier, streaked in mud like the pale demon, as if he’d just been pulled from the grave. 
He sat up and his joints creaked. This drew the attention of that ghoul, whose pale eyes studied him with a cat-like curiosity. It pushed itself upright, matching Mandri’s pose, and suddenly the creature didn’t seem so helpless. Mandri decided he should look for a way out of this cramped little space.
He stood up, slow and deliberate, half because he didn’t want to make any sudden movements that could be misinterpreted, and half because his muscles simply couldn’t move any faster. He backed up against his side of the cave, tousled hair brushing the low ceiling, and he felt his way along the sandstone towards the shadows on his right.
The rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. So, Mandri shuffled back the other way, keeping close to the rock, staying as far away as he could from the pale creature who watched him with unsettling intent. 
Mandri’s searching fingers found a wide crack in the rock behind him. It seemed like a dark opening that he could shimmy through, but when he stuck his arm into it, his fingers butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his back exposed in present company, he returned to his brown blanket and straw bed.
There was only one other direction to explore. Behind the creature’s right shoulder was a hole in the rock that was wide enough to crawl into. Mandri’s eyes strained to see if it dead-ended.
“There’s no way out that way,” the demon said. Its voice was even and clear, shockingly free of the rankling pain it must be feeling. “Or I should say, there is an opening there that leads straight up, but it is not something you can fit through. I’m afraid it’s just another cranny for the lizards.”
“Lizards?” Mandri asked. The word flew out of his mouth without him realizing he was starting up a conversation.
“Yes. Lizards,” the demon said. It pointed up with its delicate hand. There on the ceiling, half-buried in sooty cracks, were a dozen or so black blobs. Mandri took them for shadows. Then one of them squeaked and scurried along the ceiling towards the unexplored passageway, its tiny talons scratching the rock as it went. 
The pale demon laughed. It was an inviting laugh, and it had an unmistakable Hrkan lilt. Mandri wondered if this half-boy-half-demon still remembered who it was.
Mandri asked it straight, “What are you?”
“My name is Obo,” said the creature.
Mandri pulled his blanket up tight around his shoulders. “Are you a demon?” he asked.
Obo smiled. His smile was radiant even in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs, but wasn’t surprised, for a disarming smile could be as useful for a demon’s purposes.
“Why do you think I’m a demon?”
“You deny it?”
“I do. I am not a demon.”
“You look like a demon.”
“How so?”
“Your body is a perversion.”
“Is it!?” said Obo as he studied his own pale self in mock surprise. “You don’t look so well yourself.” Obo leaned forward slightly. “I’ve given you my name,” he said, “So its only fair if you give me yours.”
“I’m not going to tell you my name,” Mandri said flatly.
“You’re under no obligation,” said Obo, “but sharing one’s name is a kindly gesture. I think we could both use a friend, considering our circumstances.”
“And what would you do with my name?”
“I would call you by it. What else would I do with it?”
Mandri had heard stories about what demons did with names. Some outland folk kept their true names hidden even from family for fear of what demons could do if they overheard.
“How about this,” Obo said. “Don’t tell me your name, that’s fine. What utterance should I make to grab your attention?”
“I don’t want you grabbing my attention.”
“Why do you feel threatened by me?” Obo asked, amused. “What am I going to do? Scuttle over there, and then do what? Bleed on you? I’m too weak. I couldn’t kill a fly.” Obo rubbed the raw skin around the wound on his chest to belabor the point.
“Call me what you want,” said Mandri as he drew the blanket tighter around his shoulders. “There’s only the two of us here, names don’t matter.”
“Only the two of us here? Are you sure about that? You missed the lizards, you might have missed something larger.”
Mandri’s eyes darted from shadow to shadow, suddenly expecting something to jump out. 
“Yes,” said Obo. “There’s that unfounded certainty melting away.”
There was the hole of darkness behind Obo.
Obo smirked and said, “No, not there. There’s a person sitting on the other side of that crack behind you.”
“That crack ends in stone, I checked.”
“It ends in a stone door. You can hear him snoring, if you don’t believe me.”
Mandri listened carefully, and he heard nothing. Then Obo started mimicking a snoring sound, his arm directing the pitch in and out, directing Mandri’s attention towards its steady rhythm. Then Mandri caught it, the faintest of faint sounds sneaking out of the crack in the wall to his left—someone was there, snoring.
“Who is it?”
“Our jailer, I suspect.”
“A demon?”
“Unless a demon’s snore sounds exactly like an underfed Jandri man who’s chewed too many borcandi spines, then no, not a demon.”
“You can tell all that from the sound of a snore?”
“Borcandi juice gets phlegmy in the throat. It gives it that—you hear it? It gives the snore that sputtering tune.” 
Obo leaned back against the rock. His casual demeanor was at odds with the ruined state of his body.
“Is this not Shis?” Mandri asked. “Am I not dead?”
“Do you feel dead?”
“No. But who is to say what being dead feels like? If this is death, then death feels much like living, only colder—so then yes, I do feel dead.”
“You are not dead.”
“But I am dead,” Mandri said flatly. “I was murdered. I remember dying.” 
“You were dead, but at present you are very much alive. When I was brought here you were a corpse. I went to sleep, and then your beating heart woke me up.”
“You can hear my heartbeat?”
“I can hear your eyes blink.”
Mandri instinctively blinked, then he scowled because he felt like he’d been tricked into it.
“Only a demon could hear such a thing.”
“I’m not a demon.”
“Well, you’re not a human.”
“That is correct.”
“Then what are you?”
“I am a Mazid.”
Mandri’s heart fluttered at the mention, not from fear, but because it actually made a little sense. He’d seen a Mazid before, from a distance. It had the same pale white skin, the same smooth face, the same slightness of size. But he’d never seen a Mazid naked, and surely, the guild of Lords could fleshcraft better than this.
“I don’t believe you,” Mandri finally said.
“Mazidobo is my full name. To friends it’s simply, Obo.”
“How would a Mazid end up in Shis?”
“We wouldn’t. We Mazidai have only a pseudospark, so we cannot die and be carried to the afterlife. Is it not, at least, conceivable that we are not in Shis, that your dead body was found, brought down to this cave in the Sand’s Pitted Portion, and then, through some unknown means, brought back to life?”
“Who could have done all this?”
“The same people who brought me down here.”
“And who are they?”
“My Minder and I were tasked with destroying a band of outlaws who haunted the Junei Pass. These outlaws overcame us. They slayed my Minder, captured me, and then brought me down here. They are a brood of thieves, zealots of a kind, but other than that, I do not know much about them.”
“Now that I don’t believe. A Mazid who can hear my eyes blink gets ambushed by a bunch of outland thieves?”
“Mere incredulity is not a rational argument.”
Mandri and said, “If you’re one of the Mazidai you could prove it—spit Mazidfire.”
“My ability to breathe that fire is contingent upon my Minder’s mood.”
“I thought you said your Minder was killed.”
Obo pointed to the ragged scar that plagued his chest, and said,  “Do you see this?”
“Of course.”
“To control a Mazid, a Minder must cut off their hand, then place it into the Mazid’s chest so that the hand clutches the heart. As you can see,” he said as he dabbed the stitches with a careful finger, “I have been recently bonded to a new Minder.”
Mandri imagined someone’s hand swimming around the viscous goo in the creature’s chest, a blooded stump of fingers fisting at a heart whose pumping bulged the muscle out between the clutching knuckles. It was a vision straight out of the rumors he’d heard of the Minders, and he’d only seen a Minder once, and she’d only one hand.
“Do something else that only a Mazid can do.”
“The only other thing that I can do that you can’t is admit when I’m wrong.”
“Bullshit,” Mandri said, groaning. “I know the Mazidai have other powers. I know you can read minds.”
“We are observant, and that catches some people by surprise and they leap to fanciful conclusions. I cannot read your mind, else I wouldn’t wonder why you think a place like this is worthy of the title, ‘Shis’. Why even assume that Shis is real?”
“It’s real because people need to be punished for the things they did wrong.”
“The gods don’t seem too concerned about justice in the real world, so I don’t see why they’d be concerned about it in the world hereafter.”
“But that’s exactly how it works—people don’t get punished in life because they get punished even worse in the afterlife. And what would a Sparkless Mazid know about Shis anyway?”
“So you admit that I’m a Mazid?”
“No, I’m saying that if you were a Mazid, you wouldn’t be trying to convince me that there’s no such thing as Shis.”
“What would I be doing?”
Mandri had no answer.  was about to tell Obo as much when he was interrupted by the sound of a muffled argument breaking out from behind the wall.
Mandri scooted towards the crack to get a better listen. He couldn’t make out the words. 
He asked Obo, “What are they arguing about?”
Obo cocked his ear towards the crack. After a brief moment, he said, “Evidently our guard is being chewed out because he wasn’t supposed to leave us alone. His defense is that this little cave of ours smells.”
“He’d be right,” said Mandri, casting an accusing eye at Obo.
“I’m sorry about that,” said Obo. “There’s nothing I can do. But we should probably stop talking.”
“Why?”
“Because I am going to pretend to be asleep. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t give my ruse away.”
With that, Obo laid back down and assumed the exact position he’d been in when Mandri first saw him. As soon as Obo closed his eyes Mandri heard the sound of stone sliding against stone. The grinding sounded out, the door opened, torchlight flooded in, and not long after a short and stout Jandri man bumbled into the cave, hunched over, the flame of his torch licking the ceiling. Behind him came another man, skinnier, more Hrkan-like, but just as ragged all the same.
When the stout man saw Mandri sitting up, staring at him, he nearly dropped his torch.
“The boy’s awake!” he shouted. “I told you that could happen!”
He slapped the skinny man in the back of the head, who then said, “Don’t tell Ayram.”
“Oh, I’m telling Ayram.”
“Why? Nothin’s happened! Look at ‘im! He’s barely moved.”
The stout man with the torch turned his attention to Obo, who was feigning a pitiful, fitful sleep.
“Fine,” the stout man said. “I won’t tell. But you’ve got to carry the Mazid.”
“Fine by me. Barely weighs more than a pinch of tinder anyway.”
The skinny man stomped over to where Obo lay and made a fuss about how there wasn’t enough room to maneuver.
Mandri asked the stout man, “Is that really a Mazid?”
The man held the torch near to Mandri’s face, stinging Mandri’s nose with its heat.
“You don’t talk,” he said. The whole left side of his face was all scarred up and his beard was a scraggly patch of ugly fuzz. His breath was somehow fouler than the stench of the room.
Mandri asked, “Who are you?”
“Nope!” the stout man shouted. He followed it up with a sterner, firmer, “Nope!”
The skinny man leaned into the light and said to Mandri, “If you flap them lips again, I’ll clip ‘em.”
The stout man nodded in agreement.
“That’s how it is now,” he said. “You’re with the Ayramun, and with us, if you break the rules, you get broken. And the rule for you is, you nod or shake your head—that’s all you do, nod or shake. You understand?”
Mandri nodded.
The skinny man spat a wad of unspeakable phlegm right onto Mandri’s knee. The man chuckled to himself, then said to Mandri, “What were you doin’ out in that ravine, anyways?”
Mandri did not know how to answer the question by only moving his head. He didn’t think he’d be able to answer it with words. He had no idea what the man was talking about.
The skinny man laughed. 
“He’s like a rat in a bucket.”
“You will be too if we don’t hurry up,” said the stouter fellow.
“Yeah, yeah.”
The skinny man pulled Mazidobo’s limp weight up onto his shoulders and he ferried the Mazid out into the darkness. The stout man pulled Mandri up by the collar of his tunic and forced him to follow behind the skinny man. As Mandri left the cave, he caught a glimmer of Obo’s cheek and he swore he saw the Mazid wink. Mandri couldn’t help but smile.</Text>

STEAL FROM MINTING ROCK


Seb doesn’t want to be in the cave because the smell.


“A moth passes for a leaf, does that make it like a leaf? Or is there something fundamentally different about its nature?”
Mandri hated it when people used metaphors to make a point. Just because one thing roughly maps onto another doesn’t mean that there’s any truth in it. All it does is pull the argument out into murky water where it's drowned in things that don't matter. 


“I simply find it suspect that your  understanding of the structure of the universe centers the human condition. The truth is that while you think the afterlife needs to be a world of woe deep underneath the earth, Solraheen might not have felt the same way.”
“But He did feel that way. He created us from His Spark, so we think and feel like Him.”</Notes>

            <Title>Salavan Soreen</Title>
            <Text>The garden holds a sacred place in Solitant cosmology, and so every person who wants to appear distinguished has one. Since Mandri grew up amongst these well-adjusted persons, he’d seen his fair share of gardens. He’d walked under the royal palms of Skinee, and he’d nearly drowned in the terraced falls of Luzee. He’d seen every garden that people brag about seeing, but none of these sights compared to Salavan’s garden, for everyone else’s garden was a thirsty greenscape, accented here and there by vibrant splashes of flower and fruit and split in half by the glow of the atmosphere reflecting off the surface of some placid stream or artificial lake. Salavan’s garden was a garden of stone. Mandri had never heard of a garden composed entirely of curated stone. When he stepped through Salavan’s gate and onto a plane of bone-white pebbles, he gasped.
It was a true garden. It obeyed all the rules a young artist learns when scribbling out compositions for clients. First and foremost is to establish a hierarchy of form—if there are stones they’ve got to come in different sizes—big, medium, and small—and they’re to be arranged in such a way so as to draw the eye, or in this case, a person, through a maze of perception and towards what is important. It was about contrast. Most rules of thumb in art have to do with manipulating contrast. Sharp against soft. Dark against light. Many against few. Big against little. Here, a rippling sea of smooth white pebbles bounced up against jagged knots of gray granite, granite which grew in size towards the center of this snow-white field of stone. In the very center stood a towering spike of Fabled Black.
Mandri couldn’t believe his eyes. Outside of the Jeket’s cavern temples, he’d only seen tiny fragments of Fabled Black in satin lined boxes, resting on pillows, shielded by glass. Here was a sharp obelisk of it, and it was as tall and as wide as any of the four-story sandstone columns that held up the roof of the great mansion behind.
Fabled Black. The skewering stone. A shard of the firmament. The quintessence of night. If it were a tree, and the pebbles, grass, and the granite were bushes, it all would have been too deliberate—a stilted garden, devoid of the dynamism and spontaneity one sees in Nature. But this was a god-killing stone, and so the stasis, the absence of life, that was the point.
Mandri walked right up to this black obelisk. He saw his own reflection in its surface sheen split by streaks of rain. He looked worse than he’d ever been—eyes red and witless, face gaunt and sallow, lips cracked, and his sodden hair clung too tight to his meatless skull. He looked like death. Perhaps everyone who looked into the depths of Fabled Black looked like death.
He lamented the absence of his burgeon beer.
A man’s voice rose out of the ether behind him.
“The stone makes the most wondrous pigment.”
Mandri spun around, and standing five feet behind him was a massive man who stood two heads taller than himself, and he had a barrel of a chest was easily thrice the size of Mandri’s own. The man’s great bulk was draped in a white silk robe, and his face was Jandrian through and through—high cheeks, a strong brow, and narrow eyes. The only outlier was his hair, for he had no beard, and instead of the usual scruff of Jandri black, it was as white as his robe, or the rocks underneath his feet.
He didn’t look like a demon, though Mandri couldn’t be sure, for he’d long lost his burgeon beer, and without its aid his burgeonsight was dimming. Nothing was twisting the man’s genteel airs. He looked so prim and proper because he kept his great bulk out of the rain through the use of a tiny, black-lacquered umbrella.
This large man looked past Mandri towards the obelisk and said, “It makes a black that rivals the crow.”
Mandri dared to sneak a look behind at the spire of Fabled Black. He wanted to ask how this man had come into possession of such a thing, and why he dared to keep it outdoors. A spire of Fabled Black like this must be worth a mountain.
“I am Salavan,” the man said. “And you are the great Mandrameen. I love your work. I was hoping that, some day, you would find your way to my door, and here you are.”
Mandri spread his arms out wide to present himself, but he did not speak, as he was afraid his voice would squeak.
Salavan walked up to the stone and set his meaty hand upon the spike of Fabled Black, caressing it as if it were a prized horse.
“It is incredible isn’t it?” he said. “Yet it is only a small sliver of the comet which buried Solraheen.”
Curiosity got the best of Mandri, and he asked, “How did you get it?”
“Bribery,” Salavan said proudly. “Provisions for the smuggling alone cost me thirty-five silver strings.”
“I see.”
Salavan grimaced at the air of judgment in Mandri’s voice. He said, “I didn’t steal it, boy, I paid for it. So what if that money went to poorer people than it was supposed to. In truth, my acquiring of this stone was an act of charity—charity for the people who moved it, and charity for the thing itself. A stone such as this belongs in a place of prominence, not shuttered away in some dirty Jeketian cave. Here it is out in the air, where it belongs. You can touch it if you like.”
“No thanks.”
“You’re right, there’s no need.” Salavan pulled his hand away from the rock. “Merely being in its presence is enough.”
Fabled Black was notorious for its aura of gloom. A small shard of it could make the happiest child feel chill and rotten. Here in such quantity, that feeling crept down to the bone.
Salavan followed Mandri’s gaze and said, “Isn’t it strange that everything that falls from the sky should radiate sadness? Rain makes me sad, and so does this stone. Either the heavens are a void of a despair and these elemental things are infused with it, or this earth is a supremely disappointing place, and so things cast down upon it radiate a longing to be somewhere else.” He turned to Mandri and said, “Would you say that’s what you feel right now? A longing to be somewhere else?”
“You could say that.”
“Don’t be so glib. Consider—wouldn’t the rain prefer to dance in the clouds? Wouldn’t this stone rather gird the stars than be stuck here in the ground? I think so. You see, the Black is alive. In a very real sense, it is alive, and I can’t wait to show you what it can do. Would you like to see?”
Salavan spared Mandri a beneficent smile. His teeth were as white as Pell’s. They did not sparkle, for some strange force—perhaps the stone, or the long march up the hill, or Salavan himself—was pushing the burgeons out of Mandri’s sight and his mind back into sobriety. 
Mandri said, “I don’t have a choice, do I?”
“What gave you that idea?”
“Well, I take it you’re familiar with the old witch, Pell?”
“Of course.”
“Pell said that if I didn’t come and see you, she would kill me.”
“She said exactly that?”
“Yes.”
“And here you are, seeing me.”
“Yes.”
“Then you have fulfilled that obligation.”
Mandri was stunned by the cold sense of it. But it was too simple, too legalistic. A demon-witch wasn’t the kind of creature to care about the strict definitions of words. It wasn’t enough to simply see the man, there was something more he was supposed to do here. He imagined Pell ripping out his innards as he screamed, “But I did what you said, I saw him!” 
 “Mandrameen—can I call you Mandri? Mandri, I won’t have this tension in my house. You are safe here, and you are free to leave at any time. Or, if you are at all curious about what may lay in store for you, then say it, and we shall find it out together.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
Salavan chuckled and his great bulk chuckled along with him. He said, “Yes, I am aware. Would you like to come inside?”
Mandri nodded, but Salavan scowled back. “Assert yourself,” he said brusquely. “I won’t have any of this meekness in my house. Stand up straight if you can. Sol’s light. You look like you were born yesterday.”
“Whatever.”
Salavan scrunched up his big round face and said, “That’s not much better, but it will have to do. Come.”
 Salavan skirted around Mandri and past the spike of Fabled Black. The way he moved, it was dainty and deliberate, completely at odds with his massive size. He was careful to keep the hem of his robe out of any puddles, and his umbrella was so small that he couldn’t walk at stride without the rain splashing his legs—so he shuffled across his stone yard, looking to Mandri like a great white pig tiptoeing its way through a briar patch. 
Mandri followed, and once he was under the roof of the mansion’s grand portico, Salavan gave him a patronizing look of concern.
“You’re soaked,” Salavan said, “A towel and a change of clothes.”
Salavan clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed from the small servant’s door, carrying a towel and a white linen tunic. Mandri was dried and fitted with the knee-length tunic, then he and Salavan proceeded inside.
“Do you like my home?” Salavan said. “It cost me fifty silver strings to import the lumber to burn the lime for the plaster, and that was just for the outer wall. This interior, the plaster, the paints, that cost…well, I don’t want to go on and on about expenses.”
Salavan gave a smug and self-aware smile.
Was the house extravagant? Yes.
Was it impressive? Mandri didn’t think so.
Unlike the garden outside, the place met expectations. Mandri could have been standing inside any number of the miniature palaces that scabbed the Hrkan world. Tall arched ceilings. Wide halls. Skinny walls. Sparsely decorated. Everything painted white. No lamps, or torches, for fear that the soot might stain that whiteness. Only natural light, Solraheen’s light, was allowed in. Today that natural light was a rainy gray that didn’t do much to illuminate the vast interior. It was dark, and stark, and empty—again, not unusual, in fact it was desired, for the dull whiteness of everything was a religious expression of sorts. White is the most sacred color—white for the all-white spark. True white does not exist in the material world, save for the glow of Solraheen’s body. Hrkan tradition claims that it is a pious thing to strive for pure whiteness. The ostentation of color was to be abhorred, unless it was bounded by a frame, in which case it was encouraged. Art, painting, these were sacred things, but they must be contained for it was said that Solraheen would refuse to dwell in a place that presumed to escape the bounds of being a mere created thing. 
It might seem that the quest for piety would be at odds with extravagant games the rich play to prove their wealth, and thus, their superiority, but instead of humbling them, the cleanliness, the whiteness, the starkness, these became the rules of their competition. If one is only allowed to have nothing, then the question becomes, how much nothing could one man accumulate? The height of the ceiling becomes a measure of how much emptiness he could afford to horde. Judge the floor—the richer man’s floor bears nothing, not even dirt, such that a truly rich man could afford to employ a person or persons to always be wiping away the filth tramped in from the street. Salavan’s floor was as white as the sway-away ceiling, and as he and Mandri walked along barefoot, a girl was crawling behind on her hands and knees with a bowl of water and a brush, scrubbing away.
Salavan said, “How do you find my home?”
“Very clean,” said Mandri, careful to disguise his bitterness.
“Yes. Perhaps you will find my gallery stimulating. I’ve some pieces here that you won’t see anywhere else—but that goes without saying.”
“Any of those stolen?”
The accusation put a hitch in Salavan’s step, and he seemed a little too eager to show amusement.
“None of them are stolen. Aside from that shard of Fabled Black, I’ve acquired everything I own through perfectly legal means. I even have something of yours here. One of your best works, I think.”
“Spare me.”
“Don’t be modest, Mandri. I won’t have falseness.”
Salavan clapped his hands and another servant came forth from some narrow orifice, carrying a shallow bowl lined with finger-length wraps of freeweed.
Salavan said, “If paintings aren’t your pleasure, how about a wrap?”
Mandri declined, and Salavan seemed genuinely surprised. “You are remarkably lucid,” he said. “You do have that hopeless look about you, but I supposed that was, you know, the general malaise of the indigent.”
Salavan selected a wrap for himself, put it in a pocket inside his robe, and waved the servant away. 
He said, “We shall skip the freeweed, and perhaps we’ll skip the gallery tour for another time, you came here for a purpose, after all.”
“About that,” Mandri said. “I can tell you right now that I’m not a—”
Salavan stopped him mid-sentence with a polite wave of his hand. He said, “You cannot tell me anything. I should say that I know more about you than you know about yourself.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“A thing to know about me, Mandri—I am straightforward and I do not lie because lying wastes time.”
“What’s my mother’s name?”
Salavan sneered and said, “I don’t pollute my mind with such trifles. The knowledge I have is more fundamental. Do you know a lizard’s mother’s name? No. Do you know more about a lizard than it knows about itself? Yes. Believe me when I say that you and every other dim-witted Spark don’t understand the first thing about what you truly are.” 
Mandri sighed. Salavan was no demon king, just another religious kook. A rich one. He wasn’t sure if he’d rather prefer the demon.
Salavan said, “I can see that you are going to need it explained. Come. We must study at least one piece of art. Come.”
Salavan led Mandri through a series of rooms, each with a ceiling higher than the one before. Common to the fashion of the Hrkan elite, what few furnishings there were, were muted. If there was a table, it was carved from a rough, pale sandstone. If there was a chair, its legs were simple, sanded branches, and its seat was woven reed. If there was a tapestry, it was devoid of color and image, for its purpose was to be a frame for the faded subtleties of Solraheen’s light, which at present was cold and dark, blueish-gray.
Eventually, Salavan led him into a cavernous room that had a circular cutout in its roof. A light rain suffused with sunlight streamed down through this hole to pitter-patter in a shallow rainwater pool on the floor. All edges of the room were laden with pillows upon pillows for comfort, all white with white tassels and stuffed inside ivory lace pillow cases.
On the other side of the column of rain was fresco that spanned the entirety of the wall. It was this to which Salavan had set his eyes.
It was a magnificent work of art in skill and in subject. It depicted Solraheen at the very moment of His victory—He was stretched out, as if flying, and his face wore a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his sword as He plunged it into His brother’s—Schisol’s—back. In the classic Hrkan style, Solraheen was pure white, and Schisol was an ashy black. The army of people surrounding them were cast in every color imaginable.
“This is my favorite piece.” Salavan said contentedly. “For sentimental reasons, mostly. It has so much behind it, if you know what I mean.”
“I don’t”
“See this yellow, isn’t it beautiful?”
He was pointing to the golden rays which emanated out from Solraheen’s head. It truly was a fantastic yellow, extraordinarily vibrant, as if it had been painted on mere moments ago.
Salavan asked, “Can you guess the pigment?”
Mandri said, “I have no idea.”
“This yellow, it comes from the Gabo cow. Incredibly expensive. The most wasteful pigment imaginable. To make enough for this fresco I had to buy three men to care for fifty cows. I had to put them on a strict diet, the cows. They couldn’t eat anything but this little squeaking bug, called a zuberant. They look like locusts, but they are the thickness of your thumb, well, my thumb.”
“I’ve seen them.”
“They come in hives so they aren’t expensive. You make a paste out of them and feed this paste to the cows, and you have to stuff their bellies full all at once. That means you have to starve them a bit so they take to that bug-paste like dogs to the bone. Then you have to time the next step just right, because you see, this radiant pigment comes from the chyme of the cow’s third stomach, so you have to be precise with the cutting. You have wait until the chyme extrudes into that stomach, not the first or second stomach, the third stomach, and that’s when you cut open the beast and harvest as much of this yellow chyme as you can. Then, you dry it out into a powder, and that is that.”
“Interesting.”
“Once you have the powder, you can sell the meat. But I don’t sell the meat. I let it rot in the sun.”
“Why?”
“Because it feels…” Salavan waved his hand in the air as if to catch the words that could accurately describe what he was thinking. “It feels weighty to have killed a herd of beasts for the explicit purpose of painting my wall. Doesn’t Solraheen look radiant? And now that you know fifty cows died to make it seem so, doesn’t that make the fresco take on a more…Oh, I can’t find the words! It’s wonderful.”
“It doesn’t do anything for me.”
Salavan’s round face lit up and he laughed. “Hah! It doesn’t do anything, does it! Maybe not. It is only a color after all. It is what it is, doesn’t matter where it came from. Yet the image is fine, no? The quality of the painting is sublime, yes?”
“Sure.”
“Don’t be flippant, Mandri. It is beautiful. This is Ellag’s hand. I trust you are familiar with her work?”
“I am.”
“You know, she’s here. Would you like to see her?”
“Not really, no.”
“Unfortunate, because seeing her is the first step in our journey. I trust Pell told you what this is all about?”
“Something about a prophecy and a god who doesn’t exist.”
“She didn’t tell you which god?”
“She didn’t.”
“I shouldn’t be surprised. People tend to overreact when I tell them who I truly worship.”
“And who is that?”
Salavan pointed again to the fresco, to the face of the black god being stabbed by Solraheen. “I worship Schisol,” he said, and there was none of his usual blustering self in this proclamation. This was true and honest, even desperate belief.
“You worship the evil one?” Mandri asked.
“Schisol is not evil.”
Mandri studied the fresco for a moment—Schisol’s shrieking face was a stark contrast to Solraheen’s resplendence.
“He looks evil to me,” he said.
“Yes, well, I must keep up appearances. Imagine a Hrkan prince striding into my hall and discovering me to be a heretic. That would be the end of me, wouldn’t it? To defend the good, we Schisolun must cloak ourselves in Solitant ways.”
“You defend the good?”
“Yes, we are on the side of good.”
“Pell ripped out Gil’s stomach.”
“Who is Gil?”
“My ox.”
“What is evil about that? Have you never chewed on a slab of tripe?”
“She didn’t eat the stomach. She ate his Spark.”
Salavan’s brows raised.
“You mustn’t judge her, Mandri.”
“I saw what I saw.”
“I do not deny what you saw, but you did not understand what you saw. Pell was not consuming that spark for sustenance. It is amazing how a shameless twist of truth written down a few thousand years ago can become a foundational pillar of belief. It goes right down to the core of it. Even the story of how Schisol was trapped inside Solraheen’s stomach is a lie. The story of how Solraheen brought the Fabled Black down upon them both is a lie.”
“Is that so?”
“I know you’ve been to Jeket. Did they let you see Solraheen?”
“No…but I know He’s there.”
“He is there, yes, crushed under that colossal shard of Fabled Black. But unlike you, I have been allowed into the caves, and I have glimpsed His face, and I’ll tell you, He did not look pleased with His situation.”
“Why would He be pleased? His body bears the weight of the world just to keep Schisol from escaping.”
“But you should see what the Hrkan Lords do to Him, Mandri. They inundate his air with deadening fumes. They carve slivers from his regenerative flesh to fuel their abominations.”
“You mean the Mazydai?”
“I mean abominations. Think of it, Mandri, if it weren’t for the power of the Mazydai which has been pulled from the flesh of Solraheen, the Hrks would never have conquered the outland tribes. This story that you’ve heard, that Solraheen called forth a stone of night from the sky to entomb Himself and His brother—well it is simple and neat, but is it the truth? No.”
Salavan put his fat finger up on the fresco and poked he Schisol’s belly, right where Soloraheen’s sword burst forth.
A click sounded from under the floor, and a square of stone levered open to reveal a narrow stairway descending into darkness. 
Salavan said, “Before we head down, I must demand from you your utmost commitment. I, unlike the Solitants, value honesty, so my good character compels me to warn you that there is a chance—a chance—that as we attempt to divine your role in the divine plan, you will die. It’s only a chance, and a small one at that. I want you to consider the thought before you join me.”
Salavan hiked up the hem of his robe, and disappeared down into the stairs.
Mandri stared down into that inky blackness, and not a thought went through his head. He must have stared for quite a while, because Salavan’s voice echoed up, saying, “I said consider the thought, not inhabit it.”
As Mandri stepped down the stairs, a servant girl bustled out from some narrow passage and closed the hatch behind him.
At the bottom of the stairs was a short tunnel, and at the end of this tunnel was a cramped room. In this room, set up against the far wall, was a fire in a bronze brazier. There were three wooden chairs. Sitting in one of them was a person draped in a sheet. Sitting in the chair next to it, was Salavan.
“Don’t look so pale, Mandri. I told you not to come down here if you weren’t committed. You’re came, and now you’re here—do you understand?”
Mandri nodded.
“Sit down.” 
Mandri took the remaining seat, across from Salavan and the veiled stranger.
Salavan pulled the wrap of freeweed from his pocket, and he lit it in the brazier’s flames. He puffed it thrice to get it going.
“So!” he said as he slapped his leg to capture Mandri’s attention. “Are you the Eunuch Painter? The Painted Eunuch? Infertile ground. Or is it simply, the painter who doesn’t want to be a painter? You’d be surprised about how many of those we find.”
Salavan puffed on his wrap.
Mandri simply sat there.
“Are your wits here, Mandri? Are you here?”
Mandri nodded.
“Use your voice. Assert yourself.”
Mandri cleared his throat and said, “Who is that?”
“As I’ve said already, it is possible that you could die. Ellag died. I keep her around for the purpose of demonstration, and I think her presence will help put you into the right frame of mind.”
“That’s Ellag?”
Salavan’s chair creaked as he laid back into it. He blew a puff of smoke out the side of his mouth, as if the smoke could go anywhere in this cramped room. Between the freeweed and the fire, Mandri was having a hard time finding a clean breath.
Salavan crossed his tree-trunk legs and said, “Tell me, Mandri, what do you think Art is? If you could define it. Define Art.”
Mandri wondered what Salavan was playing at.
He said, “Art is whatever you want it to be.”
“Don’t be coy, Mandri. This is important. You must be eased into the right frame of mind before we move on to weightier things.”
“I just don’t think it’s an interesting question, and I’m more concerned about what’s under that sheet.”
“Is that why you don’t want to paint anymore, you think it’s uninteresting?”
“More or less.”
“Which is it, more, or less? Be specific. You’ve spent too much time in front of an easel not to have some idea of what it is that you are doing.”
“I make pretty pictures.”
Salavan rolled his eyes and took a long drag from his wrap. He held the smoke in his great big chest, and when he finally exhaled, his round shoulders slumped like the essence life was leaving him.
“You think Art is merely a word,” he said. “You think that it’s a label that people slap onto things for utility.”
“I didn’t say that.”
“Then say something. I’m trying to help you avoid ending up like Ellag here.”
Salavan puts his arm around Ellag’s shoulder and gave her body a friendly shake. Her sheeted head rolled limply and then settled into the crook of Salavan’s shoulder as if she were looking to cuddle. As she did, the sheet pulled taught over her face, and as it did, a smear of blood welled up to stain the fibers.
Salavan narrowed his eyes and glared at Mandrameen. The air between them swirled with the smoke. 
Salavan said, “Answer the god-damned question.”
“Is she dead?”
“Of course she’s dead. Answer the question.”
“What was the question?” 
Salavan sighed, then he steadied Ellag back onto her own chair so that he could lean forward and free his hands for explanation. He said, “Ellag thought that art was about the artist. A person goes out into the world and has some incredible experience—like you’re having now. It changes them in some important, fundamental way. They are a different person because of it. They look at the world differently. But how could any of their friends or family know that any of this has occurred? The change is internal. It is not written on the skin. There’s no new sparkle in the eye. Their behavior might be different, but that will never communicate the depth of what is going on inside the mind. Consider a woman crying—for what reason does she cry? She tells you her child has died, but you’ve never had a child, Mandri, so how could you understand? This is the problem which Art purports to solve. A work of art is an attempt to break through that impenetrable barrier between our minds.”
Not one word of that made it to Mandri’s ear. He was too focused on how excited Salavan was to speak. The man was so wrapped up in his words, and in the freeweed’s smoke, that Mandri wondered if he could make a dash for the stairs.
Salavan said, “That’s what Ellag thought. She thought that art is a thing an artist does to let everyone else to know what’s going on inside.”
Mandri nodded along.
“Does that make sense?”
“It’s very sentimental.”
“Isn’t it? Sentimental, yes, that would be a word for it. Unfortunately, it is completely and utterly wrong. Look how wrong it can be.”
Salavan bent down, grabbed the foot of Ellag’s sheet, and in one quick flourish, he flipped it over the back of her chair to reveal her corpse.
Her dead head bobbed and settled, and as it did a trickle of blood dripped out of the empty sockets that had once held her eyes. The belly of her tunic had been ripped apart, while the belly itself had been carved open with surgical care—skin folded back like a book to reveal a cavity under her ribs. The firelight flickered inside. Mandri could see her spine. She was hollowed out. 
“Steady, Mandri. Steady yourself… Now, looking at Ellag, you might be wondering what I am attempting to communicate with this work of art. You might suppose that I think that I am the artist, and that this,” he put his hand on Ellag’s skull and twisted it about in a perverse display of puppetry. “This is me communicating to you in a way that lets you experience, in a profound way, who I am and what it’s like to be me.”
He let go of Ellag’s head, and it slumped down onto her collarbone.
“But that would be a misunderstanding. Consider this—why isn’t speech, casual, conversational speech like we’re having now, why isn’t that considered to be Art? I am manipulating my throat, tongue, teeth, and lips to shape a string of sounds for you to experience. Sentences are things that can break down that barrier between our minds, yes?”
At this point the freeweed was having its way with Salavan. His arm’s gesticulations were growing frenetic. He cut the air with a slicing hand and said, “No. I am not an artist. I am many things, but I am not an artist.”
“You’re a murderer.”
“I’m not a murderer, either.”
Salavan took another big drag from his freeweed. The room was so small, and the smoke was so thick, that Mandri supposed it was getting to him too.
“Actually,” Salavan said, “that’s not true, I am a murderer. But I think you’re referring to Ellag, here. I did not kill Ellag. She died because she thought painting was about the artist. She thought that the painter was important. Like you, she thought far too much of herself.” He was now churning his words in the air with his free hand, as if mixing his musings with the smoke would bring out some flavor of the truth.
“You’re insane,” said Mandri.
“It is good that you should say that. Ellag was never able to make that step. She was too…she was too wrapped up in herself. Frightened.” He leaned forward a little in his seat. “See, if you look into the dark when you’re frightened, you’re bound to see frightening things.” 
Salavan made an explosion with his fingers, pretending to burst his eyes.
“Her eyes exploded?” Mandri asked.
“They did. It was fascinating.”
“What about her stomach?”
“Oh. That was me. All done after the fact, I assure you. Pell wanted to query the girl’s stomach. But we shouldn’t get distracted. I think you are about where you need to be.” He poked these words with his wrap of freeweed, shaking a clump of ash free from the glowing tip.
Salavan eyed his wrap with some concern, then stood, set it gently down onto the corner of his seat, and moseyed over to the corner of the room hidden by Ellag’s shadow. He bent down and picked up a huge square stone slab which was as black as the darkness in which it sat. Salavan struggled with it for a moment, then propped it up against his thighs and waddled it over. He set it down carefully at Mandri’s feet, and then he shuffled back into the dark to fetch three three clay jars. He set these down next to the black stone panel. In each jar was black paint.
Salavan pulled from his robe a paintbrush. Its handle was short, half as long as Mandri’s forearm—short, at least, compared to the length of the brush’s head, which was about the same length. It looked more like a miniature whip than a paintbrush. Salavan handed it to Mandri and said, “I want you to use these paints to paint a picture.”
“Of what?”
“Don’t think about what you are painting. Don’t give yourself that privilege. Don’t think about what should or shouldn’t be. You need to simply start painting.”
“You want me to figure things out as I go?”
“No. No. Don’t figure anything out. You are merely a tool. True art creates itself. It is reckoned with on its own terms. It is its own experience. It communicates nothing but what it is. You kneel here—” Salavan rubbed the floor in front of Mandri with his foot. “And you become the tool by which the work creates itself.”
Mandri squinted in confusion. None of that made a lick of sense. If he thought about nothing, then he would paint nothing. Even if he wanted to paint something, it would be hopeless, because in this dim light he wouldn’t be able to see what he was doing. And there were only the three black paints to put on a black slab of rock.
Salavan sat back down, and the sheer weight of him plopping onto his too-small chair disturbed Ellag’s corpse and she slumped forward over her knees. Her limp wrists smacked onto the floor.
Mandri decided he better get it over with. If swirled some paint on the rock, then maybe Salavan would let him leave.
He knelt down and thought about what he should do.
With no palette, the stone itself would have to be the palette. It wasn’t like he was going to run into trouble mixing paints if the only color was black. One by one one, he picked up the clay jars and, trembling, he poured their contents onto the stone surface. The only difference between these paints, it seemed, was their viscosity. The first paint came out of its jar in a clump. It slopped onto the stone like a sandy gel. Mandri could see little granules of Fabled Black sparkling in the firelight. The next paint was a clean, syrupy goo that drizzled out of the jar. The last paint was so thin that he had to be careful pouring it out, lest it splash all over the place. Thankfully, the surface of the stone was ever so slightly bowled.
When Mandri was done with all this, he cast a side-eyed glance at Salavan to see if the man approved of what he was doing.
Salavan glared back and said, “Don’t look at me, look at the work.”
Mandri’s breathing grew nervy, and the smoke and the air was stifling. He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, but that was as futile an act as painting with all black because the room's heat had become unbearable. He studied the black-slathered stone and tried to find the specific something he was supposed to do, that certain behavior that Salavan was surely looking for. He knew if he didn’t do it, he wouldn’t be allowed to leave.
What should he paint?
What could he possibly paint with black on top of black on top of black?
He poked the long-haried brush into the sandy gel and spread it around. It did not mix with the other paints, it pushed right through them, and the thinner paints in turn flooded into the grooves left by the brush’s passing.
Mandri sat back on his heels and studied the whorl he’d made. 
He noticed how the sheen of the orange firelight played with the different paints. It would stick softly to the fine grained gel, it would stipple the syrupy fluid, and it hardly touched the thinnest paint. Wherever the thinnest paint pooled, the image was truly black.
Mandri began to push and pull the paints around to build an image out of the light, as a sculptor might build an image out of shadows. He didn’t much care about what he was making, the brush hairs were too long and too limp to be too deliberate.
What was he making?
Black pools welled up like the hollows of human eyes.
A face, why not?
A stripe of shadow for the upper lip.
Mound up the gel to bring out the cheeks.
It was coming along.
A long and powerful face.
Mandri swirled the brush around in an eye socket, trying to find an eye.
Suddenly, there it was, an eye of firelight.
It blinked.
Mandri startled backwards in fright. He quickly gathered his wits and peered disbelievingly down at that fire-flickering eye.
The thinnest stream of black ran down below the upper lip, opening the mouth, drawing Mandri’s eye.
Was there a tongue in there? A black snake of a tongue glinting in the back of the throat?
Yes. There it was.
“Do you see this?” Mandri asked, but no response came.
He looked up to see what Salavan was doing, but Salavan was not there. Neither was the dead woman. Neither were the chairs, or the walls, or the room—there was only Mandri, the fire, the face, and the void.
Suddenly, the face began to extrude up out of the stone, dripping in Fabled Black. Mandri scrambled backwards on all fours.
When the black head was fully in the round it tilted down to stare at Mandri. Its eyes were a rainbow fire and its gaze consumed him. Mandri could feel his Spark tug against his stomach, as if it were being pulled.
He screamed, but no sound came out. Courage swelled up in his lungs and he ran towards the head and kicked it as hard as he could. The moment his toes made contact with being’s nose, an unseen pressure grasped at Mandri’s throat, like a pair of strangling hands, and yanked him out of the void.
When Mandri opened his eyes again, he was stunned to see that he was back in Salavan’s basement. It was Salavan’s hands on his throat, and it was Salavan’s face hovering over his own.
“What did you see?” Salavan asked as he shook Mandri.
Mandri’s brow was pouring with sweat. 
“I saw—I saw a face.”
Salavan studied the painted slab, then muttered a single, breathless word— “Incredible...”
“I kicked it.”
Salvan’s jaw dropped.
“You did WHAT!?”
Mandri shrank back against Salvan's angry spittle and tried to pull himself free from his grip. Salvan was too strong. He roared and threw his great weight upon Mandri, and as soon as Mandri was pinned against the ground, Salvan’s meaty hands began to squeeze his throat.
Mandri’s throat collapsed under the pressure.
“Hold still, Mandrameen! Hold still!”
Salavan jabbed his elbow into Mandri’s stomach and leaned his great weight into it, squeezing the air from Mandri’s lungs. Tears streamed down Mandri’s face and his chest burned in agony.
Salavan’s plump smile savored every desperate wheeze.
“I knew it wasn’t you the moment I saw you,” he muttered.
A few juddering moments later, and Mandrameen was dead.</Text>

            <Title>Charnel Road</Title>
            <Text>Mandri was hauled out of the pit cave on a knotted rope. Once out on the surface, he got his first real look at the Sand’s Pitted Portion. He’d seen paintings of it, as any time a person wants to bring the magic of the world into their home they order the standard eight-piece polyptych of the Sand’s Eight Portions, and when it came to the Pitted Portion, the painting was more or less the same every time—a view from high up in the western Hias looking down at landscape of barren rock dotted with large pits like the one he’d just been pulled out of. In Hrkan eyes, it was a land in which to sweep the spall of battered nations.
It turns out, those paintings were lies, for laid out before Mandri was an ordinary looking desert plain, with stands of green scrub-brush battling against stands of pink-flowered browngrass, with splotches of barren rock here and there acting as a no man’s land between these warring tribes. And so far as Mandri could see, there was only one other pit about a hundred yards to the north. There might have been more of them, but he didn’t have time to find out because Tob plopped a heavy, knobby sack onto his shoulder and told him he had to carry it.
Walking was a difficult thing for Mandri. The heat of the afternoon sun was sweltering, and his legs were still deeply sore. His mind was the only part of him in full working order, and that was no good because a sober and alert Mandrameen was a complainer. Two gruff men walked alongside him, and one of them smelled like a festering lizard bite. The other man was Moto. Mandri’s dislike of Moto was profound, because Mandri had spent a lot of effort trying to get away from people like Moto. He’d tried running away to be a farmer, he had tried losing himself in burgeons, he even tried dying. Yet here he was, meandering through the Pitted Portion, far enough out into the wilderness to wonder if anyone had ever stepped foot on this spot of earth before, and there was Moto, striding alongside him, a good and well-adjusted person. Mandri could tell just by looking at him that Moto judged people based on their appearance. 
And damn it, the man was handsome, with sharp, even features, a clean-shaven and chiseled jaw, goodly height, broad shoulders, and bird-bright eyes looking out at the world like it was all a game, like people were toys. Even when standing still the man was dynamic. Standing still, he looked exactly like a heroic statue of Zos, a swerve of coiled strength. And his color was an exact match in shade to the color of Zos’s painted skin—two parts umber, one part Wazian blue. To top it off, his garb was disgustingly fashionable, with his orange robe tucked and folded to compose a pattern of inverted triangles that accentuated the athletic V of his torso. Such considerations, set against the struggle for survival out in the Sand, was rude. It was rude to look so healthy. Moto even had a sword with a gold plated hilt. It was clear that this man was well-adjusted, and in Mandri’s eyes, being well-adjusted was as clear a sign of derangement as is possible.
Mandri eventually lagged behind on account of his abiding weakness, and Moto dropped back with him. The two were walking side by side around bush and bramble. Mandri wondered aloud where they were going. Moto said that they were following the road. 
This didn’t answer Mandri’s question, so he asked, “The road?”
Moto laughed and said, “You can’t see the road?” Then he laughed again. His was an arrogant laugh. It started with a twinge of annoyed disbelief and ended with a note of derision.
The thing was, Mandri did see the road. They were walking along the gentlest raised hump of earth which snaked away into the infinite distance, a slope so slight and obscured by brush that, sure, it was easy to miss, or easy to mistake for a natural drift of dirt, but Mandri saw it.
“You don’t know about charnel roads?” Moto asked.
Mandri knew about charnel roads but he didn’t want to engage the man. He kept his eyes down and tried to look like he was too miserable to talk, which was easy to do because it was true.
“This is the Bazul Road,” said Moto. “The whole Sand is full of charnel roads just like this one.” Moto then kicked the ground and scattered some loose stones, as if doing so made the road’s existence more believable. “You don’t see it because it’s so overgrown.” 
“Must be.”
“It is…it is…So look, I’m going to ask you some questions, and I want you to answer them truthfully and to the best of your ability.”
Mandri was wondering when this moment would come. He said, “Alright,” and was hopeful about it, because he wanted to get some information in return.
“Who are you?” Moto asked.
“I am Mandrameen. People call me Mandri.”
“I said answer the question to the best of your ability. Was that the best answer you could give?”
Mandri reflexively smiled to soothe the edge in Moto’s voice and said, “Well, usually when people ask that question they’re asking for a name.”
Moto nipped back, saying, “Usually, people don’t preface a question by telling you to answer it to the best of your ability. So, I’ll ask again—who are you?”
“My name is Mandri, and I was a farmer, and before that I was a painter.”
“A painter?”
“Yes.”
“Interesting,” Moto mused. This news seemed to liven him up. “Go on.”
“There’s not much else. I guess I like burgeons.”
“I could tell.”
“How?”
“Is that why we found you dead in the Junei hills? Were you looking for burgeons? What—you were high and forgot to bring water?”
“I honestly don’t know. The last thing I remember, I was in Meskalem.”
“Meskalem?”
“Yeah, I don’t know how I ended up out here in the Sand.”
“Give it some thought.”
The two of them marched along in silence as Moto gave Mandri time to think. Mandri watched the scattered column of Ayramun spread out in front of them.
“I really don’t know,” Mandri finally said.
“I said give it some thought.”
“I can give it all the thought I want, it won’t help. You might have found me dead in the Junei, but that’s not where I died. I died in Meskalem. After that, I don’t know what happened to me. I was dead.”
Moto stopped walking and he yanked on Mandri’s shoulder-slung sack to get him to stop too.
“Another question,” said Moto. “Answer me honestly—are you stupid? Be honest, there’s no shame in it—are you usually dumber than the people around you?”
Mandri laughed at the bluntness, but his laugh tapered off because Moto was dead serious. The man really thought he was stupid.
“I’m not dumb. I’m telling you what I know.”
Moto looked up at the sky as if to prepare himself for an unavailing labor. Then he said, “The way I see it, either you’re being short with me because you think you can get away with it, which means you’re stupid, or you're doing it because you don’t understand the meaning of the word ‘thorough’, which would also mean you’re stupid. So which is it?”
Mandri shrugged.
“Boy, You been brought back to life, but whether or not you stay that way is going to depend upon how you answer my questions. Notice that I put emphasis on the word ‘how’. I’m talking about respect. Be thorough. And don’t lie. The Sand is big, but there’s no room for a lip shitter.”
Mandri suspected that no matter what he said, nothing was going to change Moto’s impression of him, so he stayed silent.
Moto got close to let Mandri know who was bigger. “I could have you put right back where you were found.”
“I was fine where I was.”
“You were dead,” Moto said, laughing through his incredulity. “You’re fine with being dead?”
“I said what I said.”
Moto’s hearty mood soured in an instant. Mandri knew it was taboo to joke about death, especially out in the Sand, but he wasn’t joking, and when Moto picked up on that, he clicked his tongue and said, “Start walking.”
They both set off again and it seemed that Moto had become a different person, more serious and bothered. He eyed Mandri though a spiteful squint and said, “That kind of talk, Mandri, is how I can tell you’re a burgeon biter. They all get thrown out into the Sand eventually. Sometimes Ayram takes them up, but it’s always a mistake because your minds, they’re too…they’re too short-sighted. You can’t think about the future. You understand?”
Mandri said, “Yes” to try and stave off any further explication, but Moto went ahead and did it anyways.
“Now I believe you when you say you’re happy being dead. You don’t fear death, because how could you? Death is in the future and you’ve got no conception of that. You may think that’s all well and fine, because who wants to be living in fear of death, and you’re right, but see, it’s not the being dead that you’ve got to be afraid of—it’s the actual act of dying.”
The more Moto spoke, the more he was getting wrapped up in his own words, and he was using his hands to do it. He spoke with his hands and his shoulders as much as his mouth, and his shoulders would have been bouncing around much more if it weren’t for the heavy backpack he was bearing.
“You said you were strangled, right? That’s one of the easiest ways a man can go. But you’re out in the Sand now, and I don’t think you appreciate the implication of that. This road we’re standing on, you see it's this hump here—”, Moto traced the gentle contour of the road’s hump with an open hand. “It goes on further than you’d think is possible. The Bazul Road. One of the charnel roads. You know what a charnel road is?”
“They’re sacred roads.”
Moto snorted and spat. “A road can’t be sacred any more than a rock can.”
“That’s not what a Solitant would say.”
“Solitants don’t know shit. If they knew what it was like to die on a charnel road, they wouldn’t walk them. If you knew, you’d be kissing my feet. Believe me, Mandri, you don’t want to end up like one of those pilgrims. They walk charnel road just for the chance to rot on them, and let me tell you, that’s not all that happens to them.”
“I thought the point of walking a road was to get to where you’re going.”
“That’s not why Pilgrims walk the road. Go and ask a pilgrim why he doesn’t make the Bazul Road in the comfort of a caravan and he’ll tell you that if Bazul did not intend for him to suffer, then Bazul wouldn’t have allowed himself to be martyred out in the Sand—he would have been killed on some oated knoll near calm waters. Bazul’s shrine is set deep into the Sand because that’s the journey Bazul had in mind for his people. In a way, the road itself is the shrine.”
“Ah,” Mandri mumbled. It was a disinterested ‘ah’, and if Moto were a considerate person, sensitive to conversational cues, an utterance like that would have him clam up. 
“They think that walking the road is a test of faith against the power of the sun, and to skip that test is the same as having no faith at all. True Solitant pilgrims don’t trivialize the road by riding in a wagon or walking it at night. They walk the road in the heat of the day, and they die doing it.”
“Tragic.”
“Show some respect.”
“Sorry.”
“Don’t say sorry when you don’t mean it. If you don’t take your own words seriously, then I know you’re not taking mine seriously. You need to be serious, Mandri. I’m of half a mind to leave you here and let the sun finish you off. It’s not a good death. You ever seen a waterless man with a black tongue the size of a hermit slug? I don’t think you have. Imagine rubbing your eyes with no moisture in them. Imagine an ache that splits you from your head down to your toes. It feels like your stomach is peeling apart, like the marrow in your bones is boiling. The worst part is when your mouth dries out, it turns black and the tongue swells up to bursting.”
“Sounds horrible.”
“Haven’t got to the worst of it. There’s an old pile of pilgrim’s bones not far from here that I could show you. And when you see them you’ll see how they’re scattered about and are missing a few limbs. That’s because drag-bellys got to him. Takes a while for a pack of drag-bellys to eat a man full, and when you’re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you’ll still be alive when they do it.”
“I get it.”
“I do not think that you do,” Moto said. The man was relentless. “Drag bellies don’t wait for you to die, they just start chewing. A drag-belly’s venom stings worse than fire. It pulps the flesh. It’ll make your thighs look like brains and your brains look like spit. They got a hundred little teeth like needles.”
He then punched Mandri in the shoulder, dead-armed him. Mandri winced.
“Whatever pain you’re feeling now, it’ll be that times a hundred. And that’s when you learn how clever a drag-belly is, because they won’t bite you in the neck or somewhere serious. They know how to keep you alive as long as possible to keep the meat fresh, like they been trained by demons.”
“Look,” said Mandri, pleading. “I’m trying to tell you what I know, and what I know isn’t much. That’s the truth of it. I have no idea how I got to be out here, or wherever you found me.”
“No, you’re not getting out of this,” Moto said sharply. “You might be thinking you can just kill yourself before anything too painful happens, but you’re not thinking, thinking. I once left a boy like you half-buried in a mudpan near Fleet. Ask yourself why I would do a thing like that.”
Moto paused, as if to give Mandri a chance to answer, but the man couldn’t help himself and as soon as Mandri opened his mouth, Moto charged on ahead, the tenor of his voice growing firmer with every step, as if all of this was well rehearsed and he was just now getting into his favorite part.
“You want a hint? I’ll just tell you. It’s because if you can keep a man from bending at the waist then he can’t bash his own brains in. I once made the mistake of tying a man’s hands and ankles and nothing else, and you know what he did when he got bit by a red-backed drag-belly? He got down on his knees like a priest…then he bent back, face to the heavens like he’s rapt in prayer…that’s what I thought he was doing…maybe he was…and then—WHAM—he swung forward and smashed his head against a rock. Cracked his skull like a spider web.”
As Moto said all this, he imitated the action, headbutting the air.
“I don’t know how many times I can say this,” said Mandri, “But I honestly do not know how I got to be out there.”
“Oh, I don’t care about that anymore. We’ll put that off to the side for now. What’s more important is that you said you were fine with dying, so now my job is curing you of that illusion. See, I know what you are, Mandri, and I know what you need.”
“What do I need?”
“It’s not burgeons, that’s for damn sure.”
Moto then called out to the two of the nearest Ayramun walking ahead of them. They were only a little ways off, but still, Moto was shouting.
“Hey! Chopper!”
Both men stopped and turned around. The bald one on the right was Chopper. Chopper’s backpack was so big that he looked like a pack animal, his silhouette a bloated blob of burlap plopped atop two stick-skinny legs.
“Chop!?” He shouted.
Moto simply beckoned him with a wave, and chopper came running.
When he arrived, he looked at Mandri with thirsty eyes and asked, “Chop?”
Moto laughed and said, “No, no. Maybe. Follow us, you may get to chop something.”
Chopper nodded, and Moto led the three of them off the hump of the road and into the unsullied expanse of the Pitted Portion. 
Mandri mulled his options. Moto seemed serious about teaching him a lesson, and since Moto was a well-adjusted man, he was probably serious about doing harm. But there was nowhere to run—well, there was everywhere to run, but nowhere he could get to without Moto getting to him first. He was completely at Moto’s mercy.
He didn’t have to wonder how far they’d be walking because some few hundred yards away there was an outcrop of several round black rocks which looked unmistakably like a giant gore beetle the size of an ox. One large, round, smooth stone was the beetle’s body, and next to it was a much smaller boulder that looked like an upturned thorn—the beetle’s horned head.
Ringing around the base of these beetle looking rocks was not one lizard pit, but several. They were more like shallow pans than pits—drag-bellies aren’t very industrious creatures—and at the base each pan was a single, egg-shaped hole. There were no lizards in sight. Mandri supposed they were hiding in their dens because when Moto led Mandri to one of the larger pits, he did so with excitement. He crept up to it like the knee-deep crater might suddenly erupt.
Once at the pit’s edge, both Moto and Chopper unsettled their heavy packs, and Mandri unshouldered his meager one, and he let it drop without much care for what was in it.
“It’s time,” said Moto as he pulled a body’s length of rope from his pack. “In order for me to trust what you say, I first have to know that you care about what happens to your own skin. But you’re a burgeon biter, you don’t care about anything. What got you biting burgeons in the first place? Are you one of those limp dicks who can’t get a girl?”
“No.”
“It was a girl, wasn’t it? Hold out your arms.”
“It wasn’t a girl.”
Moto began to wrap a figure eight of rope around Mandri’s wrists. He said, “A boy your age gets upset and jumps into burgeons, it’s always over a girl.”
“Believe what you want.”
“A man’s got to have a reason to be sad. Chopper gets sad when you don’t let him chop.”
Chopper, who had been waiting patiently this whole time, perked up at the mention of his favorite word.
“Chop?”
“No chop,” said Moto.
Chopper’s shoulders sank.
“You see?” said Moto. “Sadness is cause and effect.”
“I’m not sad.”
“You’re right, you’re not sad, that’s not the right word—the right word is…is…” Moto looked up at the empty sky searching for inspiration. “I could never find the correct word for what you are, probably because it hasn’t been made yet. What you are has somehow escaped the notice of every poet who ever lived. But I know what you are because I used to be like you. That’s why you should count yourself lucky to have stumbled into me. I’m the one person in this whole wide world who knows how to cure you.”
Moto motioned to Chopper, but Chopper was too busy salivating at the sight of the too-long length of rope left after Moto had Mandri’s wrists together.
“Chop?” asked Chopper.
“No chop,” said Moto. “I want you to hold the boy down.”
Chopper, sullen, marched over and forced Mandri onto his ass. Mandri struggled a little, confused as to what, precisely, Chopper’s herks and jerks were trying to achieve. But damned, he was strong.
Moto pulled out another length of rope and said, “If you make this difficult, I’m going to have Chopper take your balls. You understand? Nod if you understand.”
Mandri suddenly felt a little frightened because Moto’s face was serious. He nodded. Moto then set about tying Mandri’s ankles together. That’s when Mandri noticed movement down in the lizard pit. A wide, shovel-like lizard snout hovered out of the dark den entrance. It licked the air with a yellow, split-leaf tongue, and before it could get in a second scenting, another snout appeared. The two lizards jostled for position, then the newcomer got feisty and started a hissing argument. It then lurched and bit the first lizard in the neck. A seething brawl erupted, and two lizards disappeared back into the den, scratching and clawing for the right to maul whatever was lurking outside. The brawl ended in a wild screeching hiss of pain, and the winner stuck its wide, froggish head out into the air. Its swiveling eyes worked over the three men, then settled on Mandri as though it knew he was the weakest.
Moto tied the knot around Mandri’s ankles tight, so tight that his ankle bones were bruising each other. Moto then stood up straight and observed his handiwork with approval. He said, “I need to prime you for what you’re about to experience, so—”, Moto paused, as if uncertain of what to say. “I’m going to ask you a question, and I want you to think very carefully about it. I want you to treat this question as if it were a newborn baby, like you’re holding a newborn for the first time, you understand?”
Mandri nodded. 
“Alright. Here it is—why did Solraheen create human beings?”
“What?”
“Why did Solraheen create us?”
“I’m not Solraheen, so how could I know?”
“Did I say to blurt out the first thing that came to mind? I said think about it.”
The drag-belly was now half-way out of its den. Its squat forearms were pushing it up as high as it could, so that its head could stretch up towards Mandri and smell his odor.
Mandri said, “It might help if you told me what this has to do with that lizard.”
Moto said, “What I’m doing is giving you a problem to solve—and that’s a hint to the answer of my question. Think about it—what is our purpose? Birds can fly, fish can swim, what can humans do better than any other creature?”
“I don’t know.”
Moto bent down, hands on knees, so that his face was close to Mandri’s. He said, face bright, “I can see the way you look at that lizard. You fear it. That drag-belly is a problem, isn’t it? It’s here in the present and you can’t ignore it. You’re thinking about what you’re going to do when I throw you in that pit. That’s what we do better than any other creature. You understand?”
“What are you talking about?”
Mandri truly had no idea. The lizard’s snout was getting close to the rim.
Moto stood back up, stood straight and proud, and declared, “The answer is problem solving! That’s what Solraheen made us do—we were made to solve problems. Birds were made to fly, fish were made to swim, and you and I were made to solve problems. Practical problems. That’s what we do. Now, you take a fish out of water, and what happens? It dies. You clip a bird’s wings and what happens? It becomes sad and helpless. A man has no problems, and what happens to him? That’s what’s wrong with you, Mandri. And to make it worse, you’ve filled your belly with burgeons, and when you do that, you lose the ability to identify problems in the first place. So, if you can’t even see them, then obviously, you’ve got no problems to solve! You’re a man without purpose, you understand?”
“Untie me,” Mandri demanded. He was done with whatever this was, because that lizard was getting close, and it was almost as big as he was. Its tongue was close to licking his ass. When Moto just stood there, Mandri tried to scoot away from the pit, but Moto’s foot stopped him.
“Here’s what I’m going to do,” said Moto. “I’m going to pick you up and put you into a problem. I’m going to toss you into this pit with that drag-belly. Your instincts will kick in, and you’re going to try to get out of the situation—you’re going to try to solve the problem. Because that’s what a man is supposed to do.”
“How am I going to fight off a lizard if my hands and legs are tied?”
“Don’t worry about that, Mandri. I mean, you should worry about it, but what I mean is, you’re going to be alright in the end. If you throw a bird off a cliff, what’s it going to do? It’s going to fly. You’re going to be flying before you know it.”
“If you tie up a bird’s wings, it’s not going to be able to fly.”
Moto shook this argument out of his head as if it were nonsense, then gave Mandri’s hip a kick, and Mandri rolled down into the pit. His sudden, tumbling arrival startled the drag-belly, and the big lizard spun around and scurried back into its hole.
Moto said, “You got about half a finger before that lizard finds the courage to come back out.”
Mandri stared at the black hole, eyes as wide as the moon.
“Alright,” said Moto. “Think about what you need to do. Assess your options.”
The drag-belly emerged once again from its den. Its fat head weaved side to side, its tongue warily tasting the air.
“You gotta hurry,” Moto said excitedly.
The lizard was a lumbering dolt. Its whole body swayed back and forth, and Mandri got a good view of the drag-belly’s belly drag. Soon it was upon him, its tongue flicked against his thigh, and its head kept swinging back and forth as if to savor the wonder of this free and easy meal.
But before the lizard could do anything, a loud bump sounded out of the lizard hole, and something inside that den grabbed the drag-belly’s long tail and yanked the whole beast, hissing and clawing, back into the dark. 
“Oh-Hoooo!” Moto thundered. “You ever seen a drag-belly queen, Mandri? She’s got to be twice the size of that bastard you just saw. This will be good!” 
Mandri stared into that drag-belly den, and yes he felt a little motivating fear, but he wasn’t about to give Moto the satisfaction of fighting back. He’d died once before, and by god, he’d do it again. He rolled himself over closer to the den.
“What in the white light are you doing?”
Mandri smirked and said, “I’m solving a problem.”
He thought those were some fitting final words. They could be interpreted a number of ways. Ambiguous but pointed.
He rolled over to face the dark den and meet his final fate. He peered into those shadows expecting to see the maw of a magnificent creature, but the head that moved in those depths looked like a man’s.
“What the—”
Suddenly, two scaly gray arms with taloned hands burst out of the hole and grabbed Mandri around his ankles. Mandri yelped in fright as he was pulled into the den.
“Oh, shit!” Moto exclaimed, and he hopped down into the pit.
Mandri was yanked down further and further until his hips plugged up the entrance. Then whatever frightening beast was pulling him down crawled up on top of his legs, and Mandri screamed as it set its long black talons to work in widening the den’s entrance.
Mandri wriggled and tried to free himself, but stopped when a searing pain exploded out of his thigh, just above his left knee. He could actually feel a vise of fangs scratch against his leg bone. 
“Ah, god! It bit me!”
Moto reached down, grabbed Mandri under the arms, and began to pull. In response, the creature caught Mandri’s ankles again—it was a man’s hands. This wasn’t a damned lizard.
A furious tug of war ensued until Chopper joined the struggle, and the two men heaved with all their frenzied might. Out came Mandri, but those greedy gray hands still gripped his ankles tight. With another strained heave Moto and Chopper pulled Mandri free and the beast’s snarling head burst forth into the light. Its visage was a sight undreamed of, the product of some unholy miscegenation between man and drag-belly lizard.
Its round skull was crested in bony ornaments, its lips were draped in tuberculate scales, and its tongue, white light, its long split tongue was flicking out a mouth filled with hungry, sharpened teeth. Its eyes were bulging out of its head—two round black-slitted orbs looking in different directions, and when it blinked, its wet, scaly lids squeezed those eyes back into their sockets, and when the blink was over they popped right out again.
“Chopper, quick!” Moto shouted as he pulled Mandri free of the pit. “Chop it!”
Chopper pulled from out of his robes a silver ax with a head that looked like a hand. He shouted a joyous, furious, “CHOP!”, and the gray man-thing shouted right back, sending a gargling hiss of swinging spit flying out of a wide pink throat that was studded all the way back with teeth. The two leaped at each other. Chopper was faster. His ax-head slammed right into the man-thing’s bulging right eye.
The beast squealed in pain and it tore itself out from under Chopper’s pinning blow. Chopper chased it back towards the den, and the beast disappeared, scrambling down while screeching.
Moto quickly untied the knot around Mandri’s wrists by pulling on a loose bit of rope, and he undid the knot around the ankles with similar ease. He used one length of rope to improvise a tourniquet high up on Mandri’s left thigh, just above where the creature had bitten it. He used a nearby stick as a windlass to twist it tight, and he twisted it so tight that the pressure was almost as painful as the bite.
“What was that!?” Mandri wailed.
Moto locked the tourniquet in place with a sturdy knot, then sat down to catch his breath. 
“What did it look like? It was a demon.”
“What!?”
“Don’t act all aggrieved with me. You didn’t even try to move out the way. You stiffened up. You rolled towards it.”
Mandri would have shrieked at the man, but the pain in his leg was several times more severe than his anger.
“Ah! God!”
“You got yourself bit by a demon, Mandri. It’s going to hurt. It’s going to do more than hurt.”
“It hurts!”
“That’s what I said.”
Moto stood up and brushed himself off. He looked around, glanced to the distant east, as if someone would be there to help. Then he sighed, set his hands on his hips, and eyed Mandri’s wound.
He said, “This is some real shit you’ve made.”
Mandri rolled on his side to try and flee the tortuous pain, but that somehow made it worse.
“Sol help me!”
“Yeah, well, all we got is Chopper.”
“Chop?” Chopper asked, staring at Mandri’s leg.
Moto snorted a laugh.
“I wish,” he said. “Oh, how I wish. Help me pick him up.”
Chopper jogged over, reached down, and the moment he touched Mandri’s demon-bitten thigh to lift him up, a searing pain shot through Mandri’s whole body and he fainted.</Text>

NOVEL STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
            by Andrew Nonymous

                                                 Chapter One

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so
that work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to
estimate word count and determine roughly how many pages will be
required to produce a book using the page size, style and font of
their house. This PDF file was generated via Scrivener's compile
feature and was created from the &quot;Novel&quot; project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail
address should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title
page, single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all
caps about halfway down the page. The author's name follows the
title on the by-line as the author wants it to appear when
published. A real name or pseudonym may be used and may include
initials, actual given name or professional designation.

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 2

spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank
line. (It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with
two spaces, but in these days of word processors this is now less
common.) A 12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or
Arial should be used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can
write using any font and formatting you choose--the options in
compile can be used to change the formatting in the compiled
document. In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the compile settings
will deal with changing the font and formatting to those required
for standard manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be
approximately one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each
page except for the title page should include a header comprising
the author's real surname, the title of the work (or a key word
from the title) in capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener,
all of this is handled for you by the &quot;Manuscript&quot; compile
formats.

         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the
typesetter. The &quot;Separators&quot; tab of Scrivener's compile format
designer can handle this for you if you are writing each scene as
a separate text document. In general, this will be handled by
compile in Scrivener, however, so that you can either leave empty
lines in the text (and Scrivener will insert the hash character


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 3

during compile) or use different documents for different sections
(and Scrivener will add the hash between them).

         Some editors and publishers prefer emphasis to be indicated
by underlining rather than italics. In Scrivener, this conversion
can be handled by compile. The &quot;Manuscript (Courier)&quot; compile
format will convert italics to underlines, whereas the
&quot;Manuscript (Times)&quot; format will not.


                                                            Nonymous / MANUSCRIPT FORMAT / 4

                                                 Chapter Two

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the
chapter number about a third of the way down the page. In
Scrivener, this can all be dealt with in the compile settings. In
Scrivener, all of this is handled automatically by the
&quot;Manuscript&quot; compile formats.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you
can insert a word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt; Insert
&gt; Draft Word Count (for a manuscript, you may wish to have the
word count rounded to the nearest 100, in which case select Edit
&gt; Insert &gt; Draft Word Count &gt; Rounded To Nearest 100--this
feature is used on the title page of this manuscript, in fact).

         Note that the actual word count will not be inserted, but a
tag that will be substituted for the word count upon export. In

reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are
often less picky about format and will point you in the right
direction before submitting your work to a publisher.

Paraclete who &quot;abideth with you, and shall be in you&quot; (Jn. 14. 17). And so we might go on. While there are undoubted resemblances, the differences 

1-6
John 1:1
In the beginning was The Word, and the was with god, and the word was god.

Jesus is the Word.

In the beginning jesus was adjacent to god, (and the word was divine)  / (and the word was a god)
The idea is that the qualities that define deity, Jesus has those qualities.
What it means to be divine

Daniel Wallace - greek grammarian - it has to be qualitative. Goes on to argue its still trinitarian. Requires Consubstantiality - 

Jesus had a special relationship to god that they could not articulate - had not been systemetized and had not yet been rationalized.

The word of god - close to the spoke word - something that is an extensions of my agency and will, but semi-autonomous - emanation theology - an emanation from god. Philo - jewish author , also talks about the logos as extension of god, but a second god.
Greco-roman period judaism.

No one has ever seen God. The only one, himself God, who is in closest fellowship with the Father, has made God known. ‘

Bruce Metzger - textual commentaries on new testament

Electio dificiliorum

Before Abraham was, I am

‘I Am’ - Ego e me. - coded reference to god’s name, but not actually god’s name - exo. 3:14 -
“Who should I say god sent me?” “Tell them I Am sent you.”
“Ego e me ohon - I am the being one.”
Ego e me - deutoro-Isaiah - “I am He.”
2 different divine self-identifications translated the same in greek - coded reference to the tetragrammaton.

Jesus winking at them - using coded reference to the divine name
	- the divine name was a communicable vehicle of divine agency
	- manifests the power of the deity

Greco Roman judaism - figures that are not god but have god’s name - starts in the hebrew bible with the angel of the lord- god appears to exodus - angel says, I am the god of your father. 
Exodus 23 - The authorized possessor or bearer of the name. By virtue of the divine name who dwells in me.
Metatron - has god’s name - text r
Son of man - enochic tradition
Tradition in place as the authorized possessor of the divine name.

Blasphemy includes more than just claiming to be god.

Ch 10 30 - 
John 17 - 11 —

Thomas - my lord and my god.
The shammah - Paul - one lord and one god
Thomas is referring to jesus as god - jesus is manifesting the presence of god - refer to divine image as the god - exodus 3 - I AM the god of your father. My Lord and My God - Jesus is divine image - manifesting the presence of god. - squishiness - allowing a follower to say that.

Trinitarian concept
-  Not in the bible
- the conceptual pacakge develops in 2-5th c.e. council of nicea - debate over whether or not there was time when jesus didn’t exist, Arius defeated, sign the nicene creed. Consubstantiality - first time christains assert - the trinity comprises 3 different persons within one being that is god. Develops because new testatment treats special relationship, but distinguishes jesus from god - now we have to look at paul, Mark, create a unifying framework that makes all of them work together. Philosophically defensible to greco-roman intelligentsia - apologists trying to spread gospel among these people. Stoicism/pythogoran/ Jesus seems to be god, but how. 

Philo - logos as second god
Justin Martyr - Jesus as another god
End of 2nd century have trinity - but still unsure how to figure it out.
1) how many gods
	-demons/angels/ but not gods, subordinate
	-because judaism is one-god rhetoric, we should find a way to make jesus and god one god - emanation or some other concept - Arius, Jesus is subordiante - jesus is a creation - god created jesus. 3rd century. 4th century, jesus is exalted more and more, and this becomes problematic.

Equal and coeternal becaue they are the same substance - a being has a single psychological identity - One is internal to the other - multiple psychological identities inhabiting one being.

Sign on the dotted line or get exiled
Bishop banished.

Council of chalcedon - jesus is god, but also a human??? Hypostatic union - 100 both god and human, don’t ask.



Everything is boundary maintenance




 in that we avoid the necessity of assuming a series of inchoate proleptic intimations of the Incarnation before it actually is narrated in v. 14.

I’m already pretty familiarized with Dr Michael Heiser’s works, Dr John Walton’s works, Dr Tim Mackie’s works/podcast, and Dr Justin Sledge’s work (primarily just Esoterica though) 

Matthews and Benjamin's Old Testament Parallels seems to be just what you're seeking. It's a great resource for comparing ancient texts, and is pretty regularly assigned as part of Old Testament/Hebrew Bible classes at modern seminaries. 


OLD TESTAMENT

- it is a library - it is an anthology
- not an ideological monolith - each book sounds its own distinctive note in a symphony of reflection
- not pious parables about saints - psychologically real literature about real people - not stories of pious peole whose lives should be models for own. Scandalous, lewd, vicious. 
- not for children
- the bible is not a book of theology or system or manual of religion
	- complex systems will be spun from this.
	- Religion is not a set of doctrines you subscribe to.
	- To become an israelite, you simply joined the israelite community - naturalization
	- an account of the oddessy of the people
	-not an account of the divine
	- it treats moral issues that are central to the later discipline of theology - indirect and implicit treatment - poetry, song, and metaphor

If you're open to a study Bible instead of just a translation, The New Oxford Annotated Bible is pretty much what you're looking for. The translation is the NRSV, which already has good footnotes. The various essays, book introductions, and academic study notes offer a lot of insight and cover much of what you're looking for. It's also one of only a few study Bibles with an academic (as opposed to devotional) focus. The others that I know about are The Jewish Study Bible (already mentioned and also published by Oxford) and The HarperCollins Study Bible.
Academic Bible Commentaries are also good resources. The Oxford Bible Commentary is an excellent, single volume Bible commentary. It's kind of expensive ($45 US for a paperback), but worth it.
If you're interested in specific books of the Bible, the Anchor Yale Bible series is good overall, though the quality of individual volumes varies. Each volume has a new translation, detailed notes on textual variation and translation, and commentary. Every so often a new volume is commissioned, so multiple AYB volumes exist for a number of books of the Bible. New volumes are complete rewrites rather than just updates, so if you have access to both (in a library, for example), it's worth reading and comparing both.
The International Critical Commentary series is similar to the Anchor Yale Bible series, but has been around long enough that some of the earlier volumes are in the public domain and can be downloaded from Google Books or the Internet Archive. The titles are all of the form, &quot;A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on [book name].&quot; The volume on Genesis published in 1910 can be read or downloaded here. Note that there are inferior, often conservatively religious &quot;clones&quot; for some books of the Bible, so double-check that any volume mentions being part of the ICC series.
Evangelical study Bibles and commentaries, which includes pretty much anything published by Zondervan or Thomas Nelson, as well as anything of the form, &quot;The [translation] Study Bible,&quot; tend to lean more toward apologetics and as such, will present theologically conservative interpretations of ambiguous passages with additional explanation being mere justification for a particular theological bent, rather than any sort of academic discussion. That's pretty much the opposite of what you're looking for.





Okay, so, in 2 Corinthians 11, Paul is talking about all the horrible things that have come to him for spreading the Gospel, and he mentions a peculiar story about escaping in a basket, lowered from a window while a local leader in Damascus (under King Aretas) has sent the guards to arrest Paul. That's how Paul himself tells the story.
The story is also told in Acts 9 shortly after Paul's conversion (in Damascus). But this time, it's the Jews that want Paul dead. Not to arrest him, but it's a plot to kill him.
So there's an obvious contradiction, right? Paul's escape from Damascus in a basket through a window... One telling has him escaping an arrest warrant issued by a local leader under some king called Aretas (the people of Damascus were not Jews) and another telling of the same escape story has him escaping a murder plot by the Jews in Damascus.
So, first of all, are these accounts reconcilable? Could it be that Paul escaped both the arrest warrant and murder plot, one after another, both by hiding in a basket? Maybe he hid in basket to get out of a house, and then in a basket again to get out of the city?
Second, why the change? The author of Acts is (supposedly) a companion of Paul. Which means he would've heard the story from Paul, some time after it happened. Maybe Paul misremembered the details when he told the Acts author? Or did the Acts author change the details on his own? I don't believe Acts was written by Luke the Physician. I think it is a much, MUCH later work by someone else who sorta puts himself into the story to give his book more credibility. Paul was a well known name. If your story was written by his companions, the story will spread faster.
Finally, from a strictly scholarly standpoint, why include the story at all if you're just gonna contradict it? Why would the Acts author, claiming to be Luke, get something so wrong? 2 Corinthians already existed when Acts was written. Why not just make the details fit? Why run the risk of such an obvious contradiction that will undermine your whole intent of trying to look authentic? Couldn't a Corinthian scholar or church leader be like &quot;umm, yeah, this new book of Acts directly contradicts a letter we got from Paul, so this book is trash&quot;. Why risk that?
Thanks for taking a look at my ramblings.

What I am saying is that the author of Acts continually contradicts the letters of Paul. Sure, the basket story may be the most egregious case, but it is hardly the only one. Acts contradicts key statements in Paul's letters like:
Paul's repeated insistence that he is an apostle (Yes, I know that &quot;Luke&quot; is not entirely consistent on this point, but he definitely seems to be building the case the Paul is not an apostle in chapter 1.)
Paul's reference to Jesus' post-resurrection appearance to the 12 (1 Cor 15:12). Luke goes out of his way to tell a story that makes that impossible in Acts 2. (The replacement among the twelve is only added after the appearances have ceased.)
Paul's whole travel itinerary following his conversion. (Galatians 1:15ff cannot be reconciled to Acts' account)
As such, the account of meetings with leaders in Jerusalem after his conversion are wildly different.
The content and the outcome of the &quot;Jerusalem Council&quot; are difficult to reconcile with Paul's account of it. (cf. Gal 2:1-10 and Acts 15:1-35)
Clearly &quot;Luke&quot; is not concerned with any pushback on his account of Paul. He actually seems to be going out of his way to present an alternate history of Paul, at least when it suits his purpose.

NRSV-KJV-NIV - And the Word was God.
It is the academic consensus of greek grammarians say this is not identifying jesus as god of israel. There is no definite article. - a copula - x is y - god becomes before verb, the word comes after verb. </Text>

            <Title>Shis</Title>
            <Text>Sheldruub is the Old Jandri word for the final stage of rebirth, characterized by a soothing buzz at the edge of the mind. It is the same word ascribed to the wild slosh of ocean foam that gets beached during a world storm. Such storms can blanket an entire coast six feet deep with salty pale-brown spume. When the storm eventually passes, and the sun shines down, the air becomes saturated with the hiss of an uncountable number of bubbles popping through the course of days. The noise is not loud, it’s simply there and it is everywhere, a sound whose source can’t be placed and so it becomes something like the wind, a force of nature, hardly noticed except for when it disappears, and when it does there comes the sight and memory of solid ground—though the ground is not the same as it once was, for the storm has ravaged it.
 Mandrameen didn’t notice the Sheldruub. He didn’t notice the feeling of his own blood pumping through his veins and tickling his insides. He didn’t notice these things because he was afraid, and he was afraid because his first rekindling thought was that he was dead and that this was the afterlife and that he was a cold corpse floating in a void. The signs were unmistakable. His very bones felt frigid and his whole face was numb—if his face was there at all. There was the unmistakable putrescence of rotting flesh. Mandri knew the smell well because when he was a child, rats frequently died underneath his tiled floor, and he’d have to endure the smell or sleep outside. The first night he slept outside, a spawn of gilt flies got to him. When he woke up, his whole left cheek was covered in hard red welts the size of fingernails, and since the other half of him had been safely nestled in his pillow he looked like he’d been slapped in the face by disease.
The smell of rot was always upsetting, especially now, because, presumably, that smell was coming from him.
And he could not move. Dead things do not move, therefore, he was dead.
Yet, he could breathe. His breath was icy coming out of his throat.
He tried again to move. He wasn’t sure if he had legs or arms at all, for he couldn’t truly feel them—there was only a general chill where his legs and arms should be. As he was coming to terms with the idea that his mind had been decoupled from his flesh and that all these sensations were phantom memories and that his consciousness was floating somewhere inside his decomposing corpse, his eyes opened. They didn’t open far for they’d been glued shut by the crust of death.
He was confronted with a low sandstone ceiling above him, a ceiling stained black with soot. It flickered orange in a meager firelight. It was a natural stone, a familiar texture where the rocky surface was smooth, craggy, and porous all at once—a difficult thing to capture with a brush. And it was a surface unmarred by the clawing rake of chisels, meaning this was no tomb, or mineshaft, or one of those rock-hewn hermit homes that pock the Hias. A cave such as this, Mandri surmised, could only mean that he had been killed, and his body had been borne down to Shis. 
He could not move his neck, but he could swivel his eyes. The cramped walls of this cave bulged out in places and disappeared into pitch-blackness in others.
Surely, this was Shis.
It didn’t quite match his expectations.
Mandri closed his eyes and conjured up an image of the dark earth riddled with pockets of air like this one, each one occupied by a waking corpse like him, each person forced to endure the mire of their own stench for an odd eternity. He found it somehow pleasant, because he wouldn’t be bothered in a place like that. There’d be no obligations. And since he was already dead, he wouldn’t have to eat, and that meant he didn’t have to worry about where his next meal would come from.
He suddenly had full use of his neck. He looked down at his body and saw that he was wrapped tight in a brown woolen blanket, and he lay flat on a bed of straw. He thought it strange for a place such as Shis to provide simple comforts. He looked to his left, to the source of light in the middle of the floor—it wasn’t a tongue of fire piping up from the bowels of the earth, it was, instead, a small flame dancing on a thick flaxen wick which bathed in a shallow clay bowl of tallow. But far from comforting, it was a fright, for its scant orange light licked at a pale and naked creature who lay slumped against the rock on the other side.
This pale creature was humanlike, smaller than Mandri, and it lay on its side, huddled against the cave’s chill. Its odd, stretched anatomy brought a wrinkle to Mandri’s nose, and its skin was smooth and hairless, seemingly burnished to a gloss as if wet, and it was streaked here and there by crusted mud. The ghoul was so skinny that its stringy tendons were almost as strong as its muscles, and its deeply furrowed ribs deepened further with its every breath. Its stomach was grossly distended, and its narrow shoulders were hunched. Mandri supposed the creature was a ‘him’, but he wasn’t sure, for its groin was completely smooth and lacked any sign of gender. But ‘he’ and ‘she’ makes no difference when the subject in question was a demon, for that’s what Mandri supposed. That’s the only possible thing it could be.
Despite this demon’s deformities, its face was smooth and fair, if a little underfed, and its serene expression was couched in generic Hrkan features—thin lips and sad eyes, all in symmetrical and genderless proportions. And it was alive. Its silver eyes were cast down at its chest, studying a grievous wound. Its spider-like finger traced a long line of crude, scabbed-up stitches that ran up the middle of its chest and bent over its heart. Two stitches nearer the middle had burst, leaving a red-lipped slit that exposed a gleaming sternum.
Why a demon had met such abuse, Mandri was not sure. Perhaps this was a human half-transformed, still suffering through its long punishment. A cell-mate of sorts. A vision of what was in store for him.
Mandri had no doubt he would be tortured as well. And after torture, there would come periods of healing, hence the stitching on the demon’s chest. This all made sense because Shis couldn’t be all-torture all-the-time. There would need to be quiet moments to allow for reflection. And no doubt the torture would fit the crimes he’d committed up on the surface. This creature here had committed a crime of passion. Why else would they cut through to its heart? It also explained the erasure of its genitalia. No doubt this was some Hrkan youth who had succumbed to the passions of temptation.
It was such a pitiful sight. Mandri might have been scared of it, but the creature didn’t seem capable of moving. It never even looked at Mandri. Eventually it fell asleep, and when it did, Mandri felt at ease enough to close his eyes and try to predict what style torture was in store.
He thought long and hard about his crimes. He’d never committed any unshoulderable sins, nothing to warrant being impaled on a spike a thousand times or tossed into a lake of fire. People shamed him for giving up on life, but as far as he knew, that wasn’t explicitly forbidden. Who was he harming? No one. Harming himself? Nonsense. He was only trying to find a bit of peace. He found peace by losing himself in burgeons, but if that was wrong then the blame was on whoever had created burgeons, and that was the gods.
He hadn’t killed himself, so there was that. He used to want to kill himself. He once told a Solitant priest his plans, and the man said he’d kill Mandri with the spoon he was holding if Mandri ever said anything like it again. That made as much sense as threatening to throw someone off a cliff after they’ve threatened to jump.
If Solraheen truly wanted to torture some purity back into Mandri’s Spark, then the best way to do it would be to put him right back up there on the surface and surround him with people like that priest. Abusive old folk. Ignorant folk. Plain dumb folk. The vain. Really, everyone in general. Mandri didn’t discriminate when it came to hating people. He himself was a person.
Was self-hatred a crime against the Spark?
If it was, there could be only one punishment with any poetic significance—he would be made to hurt himself. Somehow, this place was going to get him to cut his own throat, or kick his own severed head into a hole. But he wasn’t some penitent pilgrim who took special delight in the cleansing awe of pain, so he’d need some prodding. He might be forced to ingest some mind-controlling substance, or be strapped into an ancient contraption of rust and iron, with knives, chains, and pulleys that could bend his arms against his will and make him flay himself. 
He tried to bend his arms, but he couldn’t. He did have arms wrapped under that brown blanket, for he could sort of feel them now. Then he saw the fingertips of his left hand sticking out from under a blanket fold, and like what happens in a dream, as soon as he saw them, feeling flooded into them. All at once, he had full use of his arm.
He wriggled around to loosen the blanket, and then pulled his left arm free. It was in remarkably good condition for a dead man’s arm. He tossed off the rest of the blanket and sat up, and his joints creaked. He was still wearing that white tunic foisted upon him by the man who’d killed him, though it was much muddier than last he remembered. That, presumably, came from the grave.
He examined the rest of his body piece by piece, and nothing was black and rotting as he’d expected, though he was much dirtier. He made to grab the blanket to cover his legs from the chill, and that’s when he realized his right hand was missing. 
Completely gone.
Missing at the wrist.
In its place was a weedy brown poultice wrapped around the nub of his forearm.
The demons had taken his dominant hand.
His brush-wielding hand.
Of course.
The symbolism was unsophisticated—he’d rejected his great talent and now he’d lost it all together.
But he didn’t feel a thing. Not the slightest twinge of pain.
“Interesting,” he muttered.
He regretted the careless remark immediately, for the sound attracted the attention of the ghoul, whose pale eyes studied him with an uncomfortable curiosity. The creature then pushed itself upright, matching Mandri’s pose, and suddenly it didn’t seem so helpless.
Mandri decided he should look for a way out of this cramped little space.
He stood up, slow and deliberate, half because he didn’t want to make any sudden movements that could be misinterpreted, and half because his muscles simply couldn’t move any faster. He backed up against his side of the cave and his tousled hair brushed against the low ceiling. He felt his way along the sandstone towards the shadows on his right.
The rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. So, Mandri shuffled back the other way, to the left, keeping close to the rock, staying as far away as he could from the pale creature who still watched him with intent. 
Mandri’s searching fingers found a wide crack in the rock behind him. It seemed to be a dark opening that he could shimmy through, but when he stuck his good arm into it, his fingers butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his back exposed in present company, he returned to his brown blanket and straw bed.
There was only one other direction to explore—behind the creature’s right shoulder was a hole in the rock that was wide enough to crawl into. Mandri’s eyes strained to see if it dead-ended.
“There’s no way out that way,” the demon said. Its voice was even and clear, shockingly free of the rankling pain it must be feeling from the wound on its chest. “Or I should say, there is an opening there that leads straight up, but it is not something you can fit through. I’m afraid it’s just another cranny for the lizards.”
“Lizards?” The word flew out of Mandri’s mouth.
“Yes. Lizards,” the demon said. It pointed up with its delicate hand. There on the ceiling, half-buried in sooty cracks, were a dozen or so black blobs. Mandri took them for some strange fungal growth, and then one of them squeaked and scurried along the ceiling towards the unexplored passageway. Its tiny talons scratched the rock as it went. 
The pale demon laughed. It was an inviting laugh, and it had an unmistakable Hrkan lilt. Mandri wondered if this half-boy-half-demon still remembered who it was.
Mandri asked it straight, “What are you?”
“My name is Obo,” said the creature.
Mandri pulled his blanket up tight around his shoulders. “Are you a demon?” he asked.
Obo smiled. His smile was bright even in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs, but wasn’t surprised, for a disarming smile could be as useful for a demon’s purposes.
“Why do you think I’m a demon?”
“You deny it?”
“I do. I am not a demon.”
“Well you look like a demon.”
“How so?”
“Your body is a perversion.”
“Is it!?”
Obo studied his own gangly self in mock surprise. Then he leaned forward slightly and said, eying Mandri’s ruined wrist, “You don’t look so well yourself.”
Mandri drew up his knees and pulled his blanket around them, hiding his whole body underneath. “I feel fine,” he said.
“Who are you, by the way? I’ve given you my name, so it’s only fair if you give me yours.”
“I’m not going to tell you my name,” Mandri said flatly.
“You’re under no obligation, but sharing one’s name is a kindly gesture. I think we could both use a friend, considering our circumstances.”
“And what would you do with my name?”
Obo shrugged. “I would call you by it. What else would I do with it?”
Mandri had heard stories about what demons did with names. Some outland folk kept their true names hidden even from family for fear of what demons could do if they overheard.
“How about this,” Obo said. “Don’t tell me your name, instead, what utterance should I make to grab your attention?”
“I don’t want you grabbing my attention.”
“Why not? Do you feel threatened by me? What am I going to do? Scuttle over there, and then do what? Bleed on you? I’m too weak. I couldn’t break a twig for a fire.” Obo rubbed the raw skin around the wound on his chest to belabor the point.
“Call me what you want,” said Mandri. “There’s only the two of us here, names don’t matter.”
“Only the two of us here? Are you sure about that? You missed the lizards, you might have missed something larger.”
Mandri’s eyes darted to the shadows over Obo’s shoulder, suddenly expecting a fanged and snarling something to jump out. 
Obo smirked and said, “No, not there. There’s a person sitting on the other side of that crack behind you.”
“That crack ends in stone. I checked.”
“It ends in a stone door. You can hear the man snoring, if you don’t believe me.”
Mandri listened carefully, but he heard nothing. Then Obo started mimicking a snoring sound, his arm directing the pitch in and out, directing Mandri’s attention towards its steady rhythm. Then Mandri caught it, the faintest of faint sounds sneaking out of the crack in the wall to his left—someone was surely there, snoring.
“Who is it?”
“Our jailer, I suspect.”
“A demon?”
“Unless a demon’s snore sounds exactly like an underfed Jandri woman who’s chewed too many borcandi spines, then no, not a demon.”
“You can tell all that from the sound of a snore?”
“Borcandi juice gets phlegmy in the throat. It gives it that—you hear it? It gives the snore that sputtering tune.” 
Obo leaned back against the rock. His casual demeanor was at odds with the crude and oozing scar that blotted his chest.
“Is this not Shis?” Mandri asked. “Am I not dead?”
“Do you feel dead?”
“No. But who is to say what being dead feels like? If this is death, then death feels much like living, only colder—so then yes, I do feel dead.”
“You are not dead.”
“I was murdered. I remember dying.” 
“That might be true, but at present you are very much alive. In fact, it was your beating heart that woke me up.”
Mandri tugged his blanket even tighter.
“You can hear my heartbeat?”
“I can hear your eyes blink.”
Mandri instinctively blinked, then he scowled because he felt like he’d been tricked into it. “Only a demon could hear such a thing.”
“I’m not a demon.”
“Well, you’re not a human.”
“That is correct.”
“Then what are you?”
“I am a Mazid.”
Mandri’s heart fluttered at the mention. It actually made a little sense. He remembered seeing a Mazid before, from a distance. It had the same pale white skin, the same slightness of size. But he’d never seen a Mazid naked, and surely the guild of Lords could fleshcraft better than this.
“I don’t believe you,” Mandri finally said.
“Mazidobo is my full name. To friends, it’s simply, Obo.”
“How would a Mazid end up in Shis?”
“We wouldn’t. That’s why you’re not in Shis. As you may know, we Mazidai have only a sliver of a Spark, so we cannot die and be carried to the afterlife.”
“But this feels like Shis.”
“Is it not, at least, conceivable that we are not in Shis, that your dead body was found, brought down to this cave in the Sand’s Pitted Portion, and then, through some unknown means, brought back to life?”
“Who could have done all this?”
“The same people who brought me down here.”
“And who are they?”
“Outlaws. Bandits who haunt the Junei Pass. My Minder and I were tasked with destroying them, but we were overcome. My Minder was slain, I was captured, and then I was brought down here. They are a brood of thieves I imagine. Zealots of a kind. Other than that, I do not know much about them.”
“A Mazid who can hear my eyes blink gets ambushed by a bunch of outland thieves?”
“Yes.”
“That’s not possible.”
“Mere incredulity is not a rational argument.”
“If you’re one of the Mazidai you could prove it—spit Mazidfire.”
“My ability to breathe that fire is contingent upon my Minder’s mood.”
“I thought you said your Minder was killed.”
Obo pointed to the ragged scar that plagued his chest, and said,  “Do you see this?”
“Of course.”
“To control a Mazid, a Minder must cut off their hand, then place it into the Mazid’s chest so that the hand clutches the heart. And as you can see,” he dabbed the stitches with a careful finger, “I have been recently bonded to a new Minder.”
Mandri looked down at his poulticed wrist. Realization dawned, and he imagined his severed hand swimming around some viscous goo inside this creature’s chest. 
“Yes,” said Obo. “Your bloody stump of fingers is fisting my heart.” 
“My hand is inside your chest?”
“You should be able to feel it.”
He couldn’t feel a damn thing.
He didn’t like that they were talking about him, so he turned the tables. “Do something that only a Mazid can do.”
“Aside from spit Mazidfire, the only other thing I can do, that you can’t, is admit when I’m wrong.”
“Horseshit,” Mandri groaned. “I know the Mazidai have other powers.”
“Like what?”
“You can read minds.”
“No, we can’t. We are observant, and that catches some people by surprise and they leap to fanciful conclusions. I cannot read your mind, else I wouldn’t wonder why you think a place like this is worthy of the title, ‘Shis’.”
“What would a Sparkless Mazid know about Shis?”
“So you admit that I’m a Mazid?”
“No, I’m saying that if you were a Mazid, you wouldn’t be wondering about Shis.”
“What would I be doing?”
Mandri had no answer. Not that it mattered. At this point, there was nothing that Obo could say or do that could convince Mandri that he wasn’t stuck in Shis, and he was about to say as much when he was interrupted by the sound of a muffled argument breaking out from behind the wall.
Mandri scooted towards the crack to get a better listen. He couldn’t make out the words. 
“Can you hear them?” he asked Obo.
“Of course.”
“What are they arguing about?”
Obo cocked his ear towards the crack. “Evidently our guard is being harassed because she wasn’t supposed to leave us alone. Her defense is that this little cave of ours smells.”
“She’d be right,” said Mandri, casting an accusing eye at Obo.
“I’m sorry about that,” said Obo. “There’s nothing I can do. But we should probably stop talking.”
“Why?”
“Because I think it’s better for both of us if they think I’ve been asleep this whole time. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t give the ruse away.”
With that, Obo laid back down and assumed the exact position he’d been in when Mandri first saw him. And as soon as Obo closed his eyes, Mandri heard the sound of stone sliding against stone. The heavy block of a door opened, torchlight flooded in, and a short and stout Jandri man bumbled into the cave, hunched over, the flame of his torch licking the ceiling. Behind him came a woman, skinnier, more Hrkan-like, but just as grimy all the same.
When the stout man saw Mandri sitting up, staring at him, he nearly dropped his torch.
“Boy’s awake!” he shouted. “I told you that could happen!”
He slapped the skinny woman in the back of the head.
“Don’t tell Ayram,” she said.
“Oh, I’m telling Ayram.”
“Why? Nothin’s happened! Look at ‘im! He’s barely moved.”
The stout man brought his torch towards Obo, whose act of fitful sleep was quite convincing.
“Fine,” the man said. “I won’t tell. But you’ve got to carry the Mazid.”
“Fine by me,” said the woman. “Barely weighs more than a pinch of tinder.”
She stomped over to where Obo lay and made a fuss about how there wasn’t enough room to maneuver.
Mandri asked the stout man, “Is that really a Mazid?”
The man swung the torch back towards Mandri’s face, stinging Mandri’s nose with its heat.
“You don’t talk,” he said. The torchlight illuminated the man’s untamed face, which was all scarred up, and his wide chin was scraggled up with ugly fuzz. His breath was somehow fouler than the stench of the room.
“Who are you?” Mandri asked.
“Quiet!” the man shouted, and Mandri flinched against the bright specks of spit that flew out from his throat. “You don’t talk!”
The skinny woman was much the same, every bit a weather-beaten poke, with dark robes half-ripped and wrapped tight, and her leathery skin was etched with lines which probably lied about her years. Pokes were always much younger than they actually looked. This one leaned into the light and said to Mandri, “If you flap them lips again, I’ll clip ‘em.”
The stout man chuckled in agreement. “That’s how it is now. You’re with the Ayramun. And best remember—with us, if you break the rules, you get broken. And the rule for you is, you nod or shake your head. That’s all you do, nod or shake. Get it?”
Mandri nodded.
The skinny woman spat a wad of unspeakable phlegm right onto Mandri’s knee. She smiled to herself, then said to Mandri, “What were you doin’ out in that wagon, anyways?”
Mandri did not know how to answer the question by only moving his head. He didn’t think he’d be able to answer it with words, as he had no idea what she was talking about.
She laughed again. “He’s like a rat in a bucket.”
“You will be too if we don’t hurry up,” said the stouter fellow.
“Yeah, yeah.”
The woman pulled Obo’s limp weight up onto her shoulder, and she ferried him out into the darkness. The stout man pulled Mandri up by the collar of his tunic and forced him to follow behind the woman. As Mandri left the cave, he caught a glimmer of Obo’s cheek and he swore he saw the Mazid wink.</Text>

“A moth passes for a leaf, does that make it like a leaf? Or is there something fundamentally different about its nature?”
Mandri hated it when people used metaphors to make a point. Just because one thing roughly maps onto another doesn’t mean that there’s any truth in it. All it does is pull the argument out into murky water where it's drowned in things that don't matter. 


“I simply find it suspect that your  understanding of the structure of the universe centers the human condition. The truth is that while you think the afterlife needs to be a world of woe deep underneath the earth, Solraheen might not have felt the same way.”
“But He did feel that way. He created us from His Spark, so we think and feel like Him.”</Notes>

            <Title>Ayram</Title>
            <Text>If a Hrkan Lord wins a great battle then he is permitted to depict this event without reference to Solraheen. The genre of the conquering hero existed in the time when Solraheen still walked the earth, and most of those ancient hero icons contained no sign of Solraheen, so it was thought that if Solraheen permitted it back then, then it must be righteous in His eyes, and so it must be allowed forever.
But why would Solraheen approve of such effrontery? The leading Solitant view was that Solraheen afforded the Lords this privilege so as to harness their natural pride. He wanted them willing and eager to go out and expand the borders of paradise. When a Hrkan Lord brought barbarians to heel, wealth and land was his, and so too was the right to place himself at the front of all creation—if only for one single work of art. It may seem heretical, but if Solraheen Himself approved of it, then by definition should be the orthodox view.
An alternative theory is that the genre of the conquering hero, in its original form, was not meant to be a carrot but a stick. A statue of a snarling Lord was meant to instill fear in the poor wretches who were conquered, and Solraheen, being a loving god, did not want to be associated with this imagery, so he allowed the Lords to forgo the traditional sign of respect. When the dispossessed saw the statues of Lords from a foreign land, they did not see the sign of Solraheen, and so they did not blame Him for their misery.
The relief of Arnaggu is, perhaps, the surest testament to this theory. Arnaggu is the oldest conquering hero of Hkran descent, the first Hrkan Lord, and in some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towers above the sandswept Forni plain. It is a terrifying piece. The relief itself sits four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicts stretches all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image is a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen, limbs splayed out like flattened lizards, faces fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu’s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is ten times as large as any other. He stands at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage, and his upper torso and head are the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seems to be tearing himself out of the rock, his face angry, teeth bared, as if he’d just heard whispers of rebellious speech and was rising to the challenge.
Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen. To him it was obvious that the relief’s purpose was to tranquilize the people of the Forni. And despite that prickling sense of awe that stippled his skin, he was wholly unimpressed with it. He saw past all of its tricks, first and foremost the over-reliance on scale—make something big enough and a person standing next to it is bound to feel small, and here, Arnaggu had taken a shortcut to scale by carving his image into a mountain, and so the viewer is forced to contend with not only the relief but the entirety of the rock. 
 Not even the great relief of Arnaggu could convince Mandri of the truth behind the conceit of the conquering hero. No man was born to conquer. He’d seen Hrkan Lords in the flesh, and they were small men indeed.
But he’d never seen a man the size of Ayram.
Mandri was sitting, bored, in the Ayramun’s limestone pit, still recovering from the rigor of death. The sun had crossed over to noon, and it shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. Most of the Ayramun retreated into the tunnel. Mandri preferred the warmth and had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, chattering excitedly like children. Then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention, and there, out of the shadows, came Ayram.
Ayram looked like Arnaggu himself stepping out from that rock relief, for he was a true giant, and his stern countenance seemed carved from stone. His hair was wrapped up in a red headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a round, black, bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style of beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet, who was himself named after a mountain. Ayram wasn’t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens—he was a true giant. And the way he moved, his long legs swaddled in thin and faded black wool, swinging in a loping gait, he seemed like something more than human. If it wasn't for the bearded head sprouting out of that mass of black robes, Mandri would have thought that Ayram was a demon.
Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, he carried under his arm the body of a conquered wretch—none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo.
Set against Ayram’s bronzed skin, black robes, and giant frame, Obo was as pale and as small as a naked rat. Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him, all staring at the Mazid like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for their master to divide the meal.
The awkward nakedness of Obo’s unnatural body drew hearty jeers. Tob was quick to point out that this Mazid didn’t have an asshole.
“No wonder he acts like his shit don’t stink,” he said, smirking.
“It does when it comes out the mouth,” said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.
“Bet it does!” Tob roared. He slapped his knee and then killed the joke by hitting it square in the face—“Shit comes out its mouth because its full of shit!”
His belly-rumbling laugh triggered a storm of obscenities that rained down upon the Mazid. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, beard frowning, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.
Obo was unperturbed. He bore their insults with a casual shrug and the indifferent bearing of a bullied child who’d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo smiled as if to gloat. This triggered another roar of fury and renewed calls for the Mazid’s head on a spike. Ayram settled them all down with a shrill, sharp, two-fingered whistle. 
Then Ayram spoke. His voice was low and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous chest.
“Elrahet!” he said.
Mandri took the word to be some obscure Old Jandri expression. Then out of the cave came a short old woman hobbling along with a cane. She was clouded in a mass of ruffled up black tatters, and she kept her shawled head downcast in deference. With her spine as bowed as it was, her head was no taller than Ayram’s hip.
She was not alone. Stumbling along behind her was a Jandri girl wrapped in a mottled, brown blanket. She leaned against Elrahet’s stooped back, and the pair moved with deliberate care as the girl was clearly drugged, or drunk. Mandri guessed drunk because she walked with that familiar rhythmless, scuffing, shuffle of blurred instinct. She would have fallen at least twice if Elrahet was not there to steady the load. Old as Elrahet was, it seemed she possessed a sympathetic strength.
When this girl set her eyes on the Mazid her chin jerked up, and the sun’s light revealed to all a sickly pale face, which is no small thing for a Jandri girl reddened by kell oil and the sun. Her high and narrow cheeks were troubled by a huge mess of tousled brown hair and a clear lack of sleep, though her dark eyes were set in cold resolve as she fought back a grimace with every step. Huddled up as she was under the blanket, the source of her pain was not clear.
Ayram grabbed the girl’s shoulder and pulled her off of Elrahet. He shook her gently, and he called her name to bring her to attention. 
“Purl,” he said. “Purl, look at me.”
Purl looked up at the giant with bleared amazement. 
“It’s time,” said Ayram. “I want you to command the Mazid. Command it to kneel to me.”
Ayram let go of Purl and she, unbalanced, swayed into his hip. Ayram caught her, held her steady, then pointed his long arm at Obo and said, “Go on.”
Purl poked a trembling hand out of her blanket and rubbed her swollen eyes. Then she took a deep breath, steadied herself, and when she was good and ready, she commanded the Mazid to Kneel. Her voice was soft and troubled.
“Kneel.”
Obo did not move.
“Could you say that again?” Obo asked. “I didn’t quite catch your meaning.”
Purl clenched her teeth and stood up straight. With a snarl reminiscent of the stories of Junkite Queens, she bellowed, “Kneel!”
Mandri thought he saw the sand shiver under Purl’s bare feet, and he squirmed as a cool air blew down from nowhere and brushed his flouncy curls and sun-baked skin. If it was magic, it was a poor effort, for Obo did not kneel.
“Come now,” said Obo. “If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
His dismissiveness enraged the girl. She tossed off her blanket, and along with it went any sign of the lethargy and pain which plagued her features. She held out her left arm, and there her hand, much like Obo’s, was missing—only recently severed off. The resulting nub was poulticed and bandaged tight, though without much care, as strands of wet and green leafy weeds dangled out of it. She aimed this weedy thing at the Mazid as if it were a weapon. She focused her energy into it, as if it approximated her dainty, severed hand that was stuck inside Obo’s chest, squeezing the malformed slug of muscle that passed for a heart.
“KNEEL!” she screamed, and her shout shook Mandri’s heart in its calloused cage. The word rattled the pit’s chalky walls, then rebounded into the cave behind her, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back out. That this powerful shout had come from such a frail and ailing girl was the least incredible thing, for the air between Purl and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if the girl’s very shout had somehow thwacked the sandy ground like an invisible whip.
Obo’s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether. For a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Purl’s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. 
“Almost!” said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had sapped Purl of her strength. She wobbled and collapsed to her knees.
“Oh,” said Obo, “is that what you wanted me to do?”
Mandri had to stifle a snicker at this brazen taunt. The old woman, Elrahet, hissed at the Obo and rushed to console the defeated Purl. Ayram sighed, then he strolled over to Obo so that he towered over the creature. With his hands on hips he looked like a bewildered father.
“Why are you not kneeling?” he asked Obo, plainly.
Obo stood defiant, naked and without shame, and he met Ayram’s eye with blank stare.
“I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
“But you are bound to the girl,” said Ayram, confused.
“If you say so.”
“She is your Minder.”
“She is.”
“But she can’t control you? If the girl can’t control you, then why haven’t you split me in half with Mazidfire?”
“I am not controlled by my Minder’s will, I am bound by it.”
Ayram’s bushy brow twisted in confusion. “What’s the difference?” he asked.
“A Minder cannot command me to do anything, they can only stop me from doing something they don’t want me to do.”
“You lie.”
“I do not.”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to do something, and stopping you from doing something?”
“To command is to direct, to stop is to interfere.”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which, just kneel before me.”
There was a clever wrinkle to Ayram’s words, and they gave Obo pause. A flicker of amusement flashed across his too-smooth, too-pale features. “Think of a Mazid as being bound by a leash to its Minder.”
“Go on,” said Ayram.
“The Minder’s strength of will determines how much slack is on that leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash. That gives them some measure of control. Your girl’s will is enough to stop me from killing you all, but I suspect that she does not possess the strength for much else.”
Ayram chewed on Obo’s words. He seemed as if he did not like the taste.
“Someone toss me a dagger,” he said abruptly.
A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram’s feet. Ayram picked it up. The blade seemed like a toothpick in his great hand. He stepped towards the Mazid, reached down, and put the blade’s edge up tight against the side of Obo’s neck.
“Kneel,” he said.
“Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from the girl.”
Ayram rotated the dagger so that its point was digging into Obo’s skin. He said through gritted teeth, “If I can’t get you to do what I want, then I have no use for you.”
“Then I suggest you direct your attention towards the girl.”
Ayram pushed the tip of the dagger into Obo’s flesh. The sharp blade slid straight into the neck, and Ayram pushed it through to the hilt. Mandri could hardly believe what he was seeing—it was reminiscent of some sword-swallower’s trick, only it was no trick, this blade was clearly thrust right through the neck. If it were a human’s neck, there’d be arteries and tendons severed, there’d be blood gushing out, but when Ayram withdrew the blade, barely a trickle of red spilled out from the wound.
Ayram tossed the knife away in disgust. He stepped back and began to pace to and fro, rubbing his great brow, wondering aloud, “What to do? What. To. Do?”
“Purl needs time,” said old Elrahet.
Ayram paused his pacing and glared at the old woman, effectively shutting her up. Then he continued on again, back and forth, back and forth. It was such a show of hard thinking that Mandri began to suspect that the man wasn’t actually thinking at all, and that this was for his follower’s benefit, to give them the impression that he hadn’t let things get completely out of his control.
Obo said aloud, “I have a potential solution.” 
“Do you?” said Ayram, feigning interest.
“You have something I want, and I have something you want.”
“A bargain, is it? A little give and take?”
“Yes,” said Obo. “A bargain.”
A few chuckles rose from amongst Ayramun. Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his.
“I don’t treat with Hrks,” said Ayram flatly.
“I am not a Hrk.” 
“Yes, you are.”
“What I am is beholden to you, and I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don’t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. If you give me a mouthful of water then I will kneel to you. I will grovel, if you like.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the unnamed Ayramun and asked for their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram caught it, opened it up and took a drink. He swished it around his mouth, bulging his beard, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he said, “I didn’t know Mazidai needed water.”
“We don’t,” said Obo. “This is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of good faith.”
“You first, then,” Ayram said. “Give us a gesture of goodwill—to demonstrate the principle.”
Obo immediately got down on one knee. He even bent his head, and it was honest. It was pure and simple obeisance. When this was done, Ayram held the waterskin out before him and poured the rest of its contents into the sand.
The Ayramun erupted in laughter. Mandri didn’t laugh, but not because he thought it was cruel. The sight of that cool, crystal water being wasted on the sand brought his own thirst into stark relief.
If Obo was bothered by any of it, he did not show it, and when Ayram finished with his little show, he said, “Moto! Tob! come hold it flat.”
Tob and a tall black Zozan stood up and rushed over to the kneeling Mazid. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand, throwing punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. Meanwhile, Ayram wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar. It was one piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head, and at one end was a splayed chisel, and at the other was a round ball the size of his great fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled it as if it were a spear.
“If I can’t make you kneel how I want you to kneel, then you won’t need your legs. Besides, we can’t risk you running away again.”
Ayram raised his spear. Mandri shut his eyes. He could hide from the sight but He could not from the sound of Ayram’s chisel-head spear stabbing into Obo’s upper leg, snapping the bone. And he couldn’t help but sneak a peek as the Zosan, Moto, knelt down next to Obo’s left hip, and hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons, and  they began their gruesome work again on Obo’s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.
Through it all, Obo did not squeak or speak a sound.
When it was done, and Obo was legless, Ayram said, “Someone bag the Mazid up! We’ve got a long walk ahead of us.”
All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled into their cave to grab more. Forty came over to Mandri and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked across the pit, he glanced towards Obo, whose freshly broken body was a frightful sight. And just as Mandri’s heart was strafed by the shame of even bearing witness, that damned bald Mazid looked him right in the eye, smiled, and gave him another wink.

            <Title>Charnel Road</Title>
            <Text>Mandri was hauled out of the pit cave on a knotted rope. Once out on the surface, he got his first real look at the Sand’s Pitted Portion. He’d seen paintings of it, as any time a person wants to bring the magic of the wider world into their home they order the standard eight-piece polyptych of the Sand’s Eight Portions, and when it came to the Pitted Portion, the painting was more or less the same every time—a view from high up in the western Hias looking down at landscape of barren rock dotted with large pits like the one he’d just been pulled out of. In Hrkan eyes, it was a land in which to sweep the spall of battered nations.
It turns out, those paintings were lies, for laid out before Mandri was an ordinary desert plain, with stands of green scrub-brush battling against stands of pink-flowered browngrass, with splotches of barren rock here and there acting as a no man’s land between these warring tribes. And so far as Mandri could see, there was only one other pit about a hundred yards to the north. There might have been more of them, but he didn’t have time to find out because Tob plopped a heavy, knobby sack onto his shoulder and told him he had to carry it.
The heat of the afternoon sun was sweltering, and Mandri’s legs were still deeply sore. His mind was the only part of him in full working order, and that was no good because a sober and alert Mandrameen was a complainer. Two gruff men walked alongside him, and one of them smelled like a festering sore. The other man was Moto, the Zosan who’d helped chop off Obo’s legs. 
Mandri had spent a lot of effort trying to get away from people like Moto. He’d tried running away to be a farmer. He’d tried losing himself in burgeons. He even tried dying. Yet here he was, meandering through the Pitted Portion, far enough out in the wilderness to wonder if anyone had ever stepped foot on this spot of earth before, and there was Moto, striding alongside, a good and well-adjusted person. Mandri hated well-adjusted people. They were too judgy. Mandri could tell, just by looking at Moto, that the man judged people based on appearances alone. 
And damn it, the man was handsome, with sharp, even features and a chiseled jaw. Goodly height, broad shoulders, and his bird-bright eyes looked out at the world like it was all a game and people were toys. Even when standing still the man was dynamic. Standing still, he looked exactly like a heroic statue of Zos, a swerve of coiled strength. And his color was an exact match in shade to the color of Zos’s painted skin—two parts umber, one part Wazian blue. To top it off, his garb was disgustingly fashionable, with his orange robe tucked and folded along the chest into a series of inverted triangles that accentuated the athletic V of his torso. Such considerations, set against the struggle for survival out in the Sand, was rude. It was rude to look so healthy. Moto even had a sword with a gold plated hilt.
Yes, it was clear that Moto was well-adjusted, and in Mandri’s eyes, being well-adjusted to this hateful world was a clear sign of derangement.
Eventually, Mandri lagged behind on account of his abiding weakness. Moto dropped back with him. The two were walking side by side around bush and bramble. Mandri wondered aloud where they were going. Moto said that they were following the road. 
This didn’t answer Mandri’s question, so he asked, “The road?”
Moto laughed. “You can’t see the road?” Then he laughed again. His was an arrogant laugh. It started with a twinge of annoyed disbelief and ended in a derisive smirk.
The thing was, Mandri did see the road. They were walking along the gentlest raised hump of earth which snaked away into the infinite distance, a slope so slight and obscured by brush that, sure, it was easy to miss, or easy to mistake for a natural drift of dirt, but Mandri saw it.
“You don’t know about charnel roads?” Moto asked.
Mandri knew about charnel roads but he didn’t want to engage the man. He kept his eyes down and tried to look like he was too miserable to talk, which was easy to do because it was mostly true. He clutched his handless wrist against his chest to play up his condition, but Moto didn’t care.
“This is the Bazul Road,” Moto said grandly. “The whole Sand is full of charnel roads just like this one.” He kicked the ground and scattered some loose stones, as if doing so made the road’s existence more believable. “You don’t see it because it’s so overgrown.” 
“Must be.”
“It is…it is…So look, I’m going to ask you some questions, and I want you to answer them truthfully and to the best of your ability.”
Mandri said, “Alright,” and was hopeful about it, because he wanted to get some information in return.
“Who are you?” Moto asked.
“I am Mandrameen. People call me Mandri.”
“I said answer the question to the best of your ability. Was that the best answer you could give?”
Mandri reflexively smiled to soothe Moto’s hostile demeanor. It didn’t work. 
“Well,” said Mandri, “Usually when people ask that question they’re asking for a name.”
“Usually people don’t preface a question by telling you to answer it to the best of your ability. So, I’ll ask again—who are you?”
“My name is Mandri, and I was a farmer, and before that I was a painter.”
“A painter?”
“Yes.”
“Interesting…but that makes sense…your type tend to be…ill-adjusted. A perfect choice for food for the Amalgamete. I interrupted. Go on.”
“I guess I like burgeons.”
“I could tell that much by looking at you.”
“How?”
“Tell me, Mandri, did you seek out the Amalgamete?”
“No. I don’t even know what it is. The last thing I remember, I was being killed.”
“Killed where?”
“In Meskalim.”
“Meskalim…”
The mention of Meskalim seemed to confirm one of Moto’s suspicions. “So you were chosen. And why do you think you were chosen to be served to the Amalgamete? Give it some thought.”
“I really don’t know.”
“I said give it some thought.”
“I can give it all the thought I want, it won’t help. I honestly have no idea what’s going on.”
“Stop,” Moto commanded, pulling on Mandri’s shoulder-slung sack to force compliance. “You been brought back to life,” he said, “But whether or not you stay that way is going to depend upon how you answer my questions. Notice that I put emphasis on the word ‘how’. I’m talking about respect. Be thorough. And don’t lie.” Moto frowned in great disappointment, as if he already knew Mandri wasn’t going to do any of these things. “The Sand is big, but there’s no room for a lying boy who can’t do the one thing he’s supposed to be able to do.”
&quot;And what’s that, exactly?” Mandri asked. His indignation was livening him up. If he wasn’t careful, he might do something regrettable.
“Ayram already explained your purpose to you. If you don’t like it, I could have you put right back where you were found.”
“I was fine where I was.”
“Really? You’re fine with being fed to the stomach of demons?”
“Never tried it before, so I can’t say for sure.”
Moto stepped back in shock and hissed. Mandri knew it was taboo to joke about anything as dark as a demon, especially out in the Sand, but he wasn’t joking. Well, he was joking, but there was a kernel of honest truth hidden inside that fake offhand remark, and that was enough to set Moto on edge. And it was strange that Moto should pick up on it, as it was unusual for a well-adjusted person to see a playful stab at despair for what it was. Usually, it goes right over their head.
“Start walking,” Moto commanded, and they both set off again, shoes and boots stomping along the charnel road. But it was different now, Moto had become a different person, more serious and bothered. He eyed Mandri though a worrisome squint. “That kind of talk is how I can tell you’re a burgeon biter,” he said. “They all get thrown out into the Sand eventually. Sometimes Ayram takes them up, but it’s always a mistake because a burgeon biter’s mind is too…it’s too short-sighted. They can’t think about the future. Do you follow me?”
Mandri said, “Yes” to try and stave off any further explication, but Moto went ahead anyways.
“I believe you when you say you think you’re better off being food. You don’t fear death, because how could you? Death is in the future and you’ve got no conception of that. You may think that’s all well and fine, because who wants to be living in fear of death, and you’re right, but see, it’s not the being dead that you’ve got to be afraid of—it’s the act of dying.”
The more Moto spoke, the more he was getting wrapped up in his own words, and he was using his hands to do it. He spoke with his hands and his shoulders as much as his mouth, though the heavy pack bouncing around was a mild impairment.
“You died once already, but it couldn’t have been bad because your body isn’t broken. I assume you were strangled. Am I right? That’s one of the easiest ways a man can go. But you’re out in the Sand now, and I don’t think you appreciate the implication of that. This road we’re standing on, you see it's this hump here—”, Moto traced the gentle contour of the road’s hump with an open hand. “It goes on further than you’d think is possible. The Bazul Road. One of the charnel roads. You know what a charnel road is?”
“They’re sacred roads.”
Moto grunted and spat. “A road can’t be sacred any more than a rock can.”
“That’s not what a Solitant would say.”
“Solitants don’t know shit. If they knew what it was like to die on a charnel road, they wouldn’t walk them. If you knew, you’d be kissing my feet. Believe me, Mandri, you don’t want to end up like one of those pilgrims. They walk charnel roads just for the chance to rot on them, and let me tell you, that’s not all that happens to them.”
“I thought the point of walking a road was to get to where you’re going.”
“Oh, that’s not why Pilgrims walk the road. Go and ask a pilgrim why he doesn’t make the Bazul Road in the comfort of a caravan and he’ll tell you that if Bazul did not intend for him to suffer, then Bazul wouldn’t have allowed himself to be martyred out in the Sand—he would have been killed on some oated knoll near clean waters. Bazul’s shrine is set deep into the Sand because that’s the journey Bazul had in mind for his people. In a way, the road itself is the shrine.”
“Ah,” Mandri mumbled. It was a disinterested ‘ah’, and if Moto were a considerate person, sensitive to conversational cues, an utterance like that would have him clam up. 
“They think that walking the road is a test of faith against the power of the sun, and to skip that test is the same as having no faith at all. True Solitant pilgrims don’t trivialize the road by riding in a wagon or walking it at night. They walk the road in the heat of the day, and they die doing it.”
“Tragic.”
“Show some respect.”
“Sorry.”
“Don’t say sorry when you don’t mean it. If you don’t take your own words seriously, then I know you’re not taking mine seriously. You need to be serious, Mandri. Every Minder I’ve ever met was serious.”
“How many have you met?”
“Doesn’t matter. You know, I’m of half a mind to leave you here and let the sun finish you off. It’s not a good death. You ever seen a waterless man with a black tongue the size of a hermit slug? I don’t think you have. Imagine rubbing your eyes with no moisture in them. Imagine an ache that splits you from your head down to your toes. That kind of thirst, it feels like your stomach is peeling apart, like the marrow in your bones is boiling. The worst part is when your mouth dries out, it turns black and the tongue swells up to bursting.”
“Sounds horrible.”
“Haven’t got to the worst of it. There’s an old pile of pilgrim’s bones not far from here that I could show you. And when you see them you’ll see how they’re scattered about and are missing a few limbs. That’s because drag-bellys got to him. Takes a while for a pack of drag-bellys to eat a man full, and when you’re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you’ll still be alive when they do it.”
“I get it.”
“I do not think that you do,” Moto said. “Drag bellies don’t wait for you to die, they just start chewing. And a drag-belly’s venom stings worse than fire. It pulps the flesh. It’ll make your thighs look like brains and your brains look like spit. They got a hundred little teeth like needles.”
He then punched Mandri in the shoulder, dead-armed him. Mandri gasped and winced.
“Whatever pain you’re feeling now, it’ll be that times a hundred. And that’s when you learn how clever a drag-belly can be, because they won’t bite you in the neck or somewhere serious. They know how to keep you alive as long as possible to keep the meat fresh, like they been trained by demons.”
“Look,” said Mandri, pleading. “I’m sorry I joked about being food for a demon. I’m not evil or anything, I’m just tired. So if you could, leave me alone. Please.”
“No, you’re not getting out of this,” Moto said sharply. “Not even dying is getting you out of this. See, I’m talking about pain, Mandri. And I know what you’re thinking—well you’re not thinking it yet, but you will be—you’re thinking you can just kill yourself out here before anything too painful happens, but you’re not thinking, thinking. I once left a boy like you half-buried in a mudpan near Fleet. Ask yourself, why I would do a thing like that.”
Moto paused, as if to give Mandri a chance to answer, but the man couldn’t help himself and as soon as Mandri opened his mouth, Moto charged on ahead, the tenor of his voice growing firmer with every step, as if all of this was well rehearsed and he was just now getting into his favorite part.
“You want a hint? I’ll just tell you. It’s because if you can keep a man from bending at the waist then he can’t bash his own brains in. I once made the mistake of tying a man’s hands and ankles and nothing else, and you know what he did when he got bit by a red-backed drag-belly? He got down on his knees like a priest…then he bent back, face to the heavens like he’s rapt in prayer…that’s what I thought he was doing…maybe he was…and then—WHAM—he swung forward and smashed his head against a rock. Cracked his skull like a spider web.”
As Moto said all this, he imitated the action, headbutting the air.
“I don’t know how many times I can say this,” said Mandri, “But I’m sorry if I offended you in—.”
“Oh, I don’t care about that anymore. We’ll put that off to the side for now. What’s more important is that you said you were fine with dying, so now my job is curing you of that illusion. See, you’re supposed to be a Minder, but you aren’t because you’ve got a dull Spark. But I know how to cure it. I know just what you need.”
“And what is that?”
“It’s not burgeons, that’s for damn sure.”
Moto then called out to the two of the nearest Ayramun, who were a little ways ahead of them.
Moto called out, “Hey! Chopper!”
Both men stopped and turned around. The bald one on the right was Chopper. Chopper’s backpack was so big that he looked like a pack animal, his silhouette a bloated blob of burlap plopped atop two stick-skinny legs.
“Chop!?” He shouted back.
Moto simply beckoned him with a wave, and chopper came running. When he arrived, he looked at Mandri with thirsty eyes and asked, “Chop?”
Moto laughed, “No, no. But maybe. Follow, and you may get to chop something.”
Chopper nodded, and Moto led the three of them off the hump of the road and into the unsullied expanse of the Pitted Portion. 
Mandri mulled his options. Moto seemed serious about teaching him a lesson, and since Moto was a well-adjusted man this probably involved doing harm. But there was nowhere to run—well, there was everywhere to run, but nowhere he could get to without Moto getting to him first. He was completely at Moto’s mercy.
He didn’t have to wonder how far they’d be walking because some few hundred yards away there was an outcrop of several round black rocks which looked unmistakably like a giant gore beetle, only each rock was the size of an ox. One round, smooth boulder was the beetle’s body, and next to it was a slightly smaller boulder that looked like an upturned thorn—the beetle’s horned head. Ringing around the base of these beetle looking rocks were several lizard pits. They were more like shallow pans than pits—drag-bellies aren’t very industrious creatures—and knocked into the base each pan was a single, egg-shaped hole.
There were no lizards in sight. That didn’t mean they weren’t there. Mandri supposed they were hiding in their dens because when Moto led Mandri to one of the larger pits, he did so with anxious excitement. He crept up to it like the knee-deep crater might suddenly erupt.
Once at the pit’s edge, both Moto and Chopper unsettled their heavy packs, and Mandri unshouldered his meager one, and he let it drop without much care for what was in it.
“It’s time,” said Moto as he pulled a body’s length of rope from his pack. “In order for you to join us in the land of the living, you first have to care about what happens to your own skin. But you’re a burgeon biter, you don’t care about anything. What got you biting burgeons in the first place? Are you your uglies limp? Can’t get a girl?”
“No.”
“It was a girl, wasn’t it? Hold out your arms.”
“It wasn’t a girl.”
Moto began to wrap a figure eight of rope around Mandri’s elbows. He was careful not to disturb the ruined wrist. He said, “A boy your age gets upset and jumps into burgeons, it’s always over a girl.”
“Believe what you want.”
“A man’s got to have a reason to be upset. Chopper gets upset when you don’t let him chop.”
Chopper, who had been waiting patiently this whole time, perked up at the mention of his favorite word.
“Chop?”
“No chop,” said Moto.
Chopper’s shoulders sank.
“You see?” said Moto. “Sadness is cause and effect.”
“I’m not sad.”
“You’re right, you’re not sad, that’s not the right word—the right word is…is…” Moto looked up at the empty sky searching for inspiration. “I could never find the correct word for what you are, probably because it hasn’t been made yet. What you are has somehow escaped the notice of every poet who ever lived. But I know what you are because I used to be like you. That’s why you should count yourself lucky to have stumbled into me. I’m the one person in this whole wide world who knows how to fix you.”
Moto motioned to Chopper, but Chopper was too busy salivating at the sight of the too-long length of rope left after Moto had tied Mandri’s arms together.
“Chop?” asked Chopper.
“No chop,” said Moto. “I want you to hold the boy down.”
Chopper, sullen, marched over and forced Mandri onto his ass. Mandri struggled a little, confused as to what, precisely, Chopper’s herks and jerks were trying to achieve. But damned, the little bald man was strong.
Moto pulled out another length of rope and said, “If you make this difficult, I’m going to have Chopper take your uglies. You understand? Nod if you understand.”
Moto’s face was serious. Mandri nodded. Moto then set about tying Mandri’s ankles together. That’s when Mandri noticed movement down in the lizard pit. A wide, shovel-like lizard snout hovered out of the dark den entrance. It licked the air with a yellow, split-leaf tongue, and before it could get in a second scenting, another snout appeared. The two lizards jostled for position, then the newcomer got feisty and started a hissing argument. It then lurched and bit the first lizard in the neck. A seething brawl erupted, and two lizards disappeared back into the den, scratching and clawing for the right to chew on whatever was lurking outside.
The brawl ended in a wild screeching hiss of pain, and the winner stuck its wide, froggish head out into the air. Its yellow, swiveling eyes worked over the three men, then settled on Mandri as though it knew he was the weakest.
Moto tied the knot around Mandri’s ankles tight, so tight that the ankle bones were bruising each other. Moto then stood up straight and observed his handiwork with approval. 
“I need to prime you for what you’re about to experience, so…”
He paused, as if uncertain of what to say.
“I’m going to ask you a question, and I want you to think very carefully about it. I want you to treat this question as if it were a newborn baby, like you’re holding a newborn for the first time, you understand?”
Mandri nodded. 
“Alright. Here it is—why did Solraheen create human beings?”
“What?”
“Why did Solraheen create us?”
“I’m not Solraheen.”
“Did I say to blurt out the first thing that came to mind? I said think about it.”
The drag-belly was now half-way out of its den. Its squat forearms were pushing it up as high as it could, so that its head could stretch up towards Mandri and taste his odor.
Mandri said, “It might help if you told me what this has to do with that lizard.”
“What I’m doing is giving you a problem to solve—and that’s a hint to the answer of my question. Think about it—what is our purpose? Birds can fly, fish can swim, what can humans do better than any other creature?”
“I don’t know.”
Moto bent down, hands on knees, so that his face was close to Mandri’s. He said, eyes bright, “I can see the way you look at that lizard. You fear it. That drag-belly is a problem, isn’t it? It’s a problem. It’s here in the present and you can’t ignore it. You’re thinking about what you’re going to do when I throw you in that pit. That’s what we do better than any other creature. You understand?”
“What are you talking about?”
Mandri truly had no idea. The lizard’s snout was getting close to the rim.
Moto stood back up, he stood straight and proud, and declared, “The answer is problem solving! That’s what Solraheen made us for—we were made to solve problems. Birds were made to fly, fish were made to swim, and you and I were made to solve problems. Not just any problems, practical problems. That’s what we do. Now, you take a fish out of water, and what happens? It dies. You clip a bird’s wings and what happens? It becomes sad and helpless. And if a man has no problems to solve, what happens to him? Don’t answer, the answer is obvious. So that’s what’s wrong with you, Mandri. To make things worse, you’ve filled your belly with burgeons, and when you do that, you lose the ability to identify problems in the first place. So if you can’t even see them, then obviously, you’ve got no problems to solve! You’re a man without purpose! Do you understand?”
“Untie me,” Mandri demanded. He was done with whatever this was, because that lizard was getting close, and it was almost as big as he was. Its tongue was close to licking his thigh. But Moto just stood there.
Mandri tried to scoot away from the pit, but Moto’s foot stopped him.
“Here’s what I’m going to do,” said Moto. “I’m going to pick you up and put you into a problem. I’m going to toss you into this pit with that drag-belly. Your instincts will kick in, and you’re going to try to get out of the situation—you’re going to try to solve the problem. Because that’s what a man is supposed to do.”
“How am I going to fight off a lizard if my hands and legs are tied?”
“Don’t worry about that, Mandri. I mean, you should worry about that, but what I mean is, you’re going to be alright in the end. If you throw a bird off a cliff, what’s it going to do? It’s going to fly. You’re going to be flying before you know it.”
“If you tie up a bird’s wings, it’s not going to fly.”
Moto waved Mandri’s point out of the air, as if it were nonsense, then gave Mandri’s hip a kick, and Mandri rolled down into the pit. His sudden tumbling startled the drag-belly, and the big lizard spun around and scurried back into its hole.
“You got about half a finger before that lizard finds the courage to come back out.”
Mandri stared at the black hole, eyes as wide as the moon.
“Alright,” said Moto. “Think about what you need to do. Assess your options.”
The drag-belly emerged once again from its den. Its fat head weaved side to side, its tongue warily tasting the air.
“You gotta hurry,” Moto said excitedly.
The lizard was a lumbering dolt. Its whole body swayed back and forth, giving Mandri a good view of its eponymous belly drag. Soon it was upon him, its tongue flicked against his thigh, and its head kept swinging back and forth as if to savor the wonder of this free and easy meal.
But before the lizard could do anything, a loud bump sounded out of the lizard hole, and something inside grabbed the drag-belly’s tail and yanked the whole beast, hissing and clawing, back into the dark. 
“Oh-Hoooo!” Moto thundered. “You ever seen a drag-belly queen, Mandri? She’s got to be twice the size of that bastard you just saw. This will be good!” 
Mandri stared into that drag-belly den, and yes he felt a little motivating fear, but he wasn’t about to give Moto the satisfaction of fighting back. He’d died once before, and by god, he’d do it again.
He rolled himself over closer to the den.
“What in the White Light are you doing?”
Mandri smirked. “I’m solving a problem.”
He rolled over to face the dark den and meet his final fate. He peered into those shadows expecting to see the maw of a magnificent creature, but the head that moved in those depths looked like a man’s.
“What the—”
Suddenly, two scaly gray arms with taloned hands burst out of the hole and grabbed Mandri around his ankles. Mandri yelped in fright as he was pulled into the den.
“Shit!” Moto exclaimed as he hopped down into the pit.
Mandri was yanked down further and further until his hips plugged up the entrance. Whatever frightening beast was pulling him down crawled up on top of his legs, and Mandri screamed as it set its long black talons to work in widening the den’s entrance.
Mandri wriggled and tried to free himself, but stopped when a searing pain exploded out of his thigh, just above his left knee. He could actually feel a vise of fangs scratch his bone. 
“AGH! It bit me!”
Moto grabbed Mandri under the arms, and began to pull. In response, the creature loosed its bite and caught Mandri’s ankles again.
A furious tug of war ensued until Chopper joined the struggle, and the two men heaved with all their frenzied might. Out came Mandri, but those greedy gray hands still gripped his ankles tight. 
Human hands with lizard skin and claws.
With another strained heave, Moto and Chopper pulled Mandri free and the beast’s snarling head burst forth into the light.
Its visage was a sight undreamed of, the product of some unholy miscegenation between man and drag-belly lizard. Its round skull was crested in bony ornaments, its lips were draped in tuberculate scales, and its tongue, White Light, its long split tongue was flicking out of a mouth filled with hungry, sharpened teeth. Its eyes bulged out of its head—two round black-slitted yellow orbs looking in different directions, and when it blinked, its wet, scaly eyelids squeezed those eyes back into their sockets, and when the blink was over they popped right out again.
“Chopper, quick!” Moto shouted as he pulled Mandri free of the pit. “Chop it!”
Chopper pulled from out of his robes a silver axe with an axe-head that looked like a hand. He shouted a joyous, furious, “CHOP!”, and the lizard-man-thing shouted back a gargling hiss of swinging spit that flew out of a wide pink throat, a throat that was studded all the way back with teeth
 The two leaped at each other.
Chopper was faster.
His axe slammed right into the creature’s bulging eye.
The beast squealed in pain and it tore itself out from under Chopper’s pinning blow. Chopper then chased it back towards the den, and the beast disappeared, scrambling down while screeching.
Moto easily untied the knot around Mandri’s wrists by pulling on a loose bit of rope, and he undid the knot around the ankles with similar ease. He used one length of rope to improvise a tourniquet high up on Mandri’s left thigh, above where the creature had bitten it. He used a nearby stick as a windlass to twist it tight, and he twisted it so tight that the pressure was almost as painful as a wound.
“What was that!?” Mandri wailed.
Moto locked the tourniquet in place with a sturdy knot, then sat down to catch his breath. 
“What did it look like? It was a demon.”
“What!?”
“Don’t act all aggrieved with me. You didn’t even try to move out the way. You stiffened up. You rolled towards it.”
Mandri would have shrieked at the man, but the pain in his leg was several times more severe than his anger.
“Ah! God!”
“You got yourself bit by a demon, Mandri. It’s going to hurt. It’s going to do more than hurt.”
“It hurts!”
“That’s what I said.”
Moto stood up and brushed himself off. He looked around, glanced to the distant east, as if someone would be there to help. Then he sighed, set his hands on his hips, and eyed Mandri’s wound.
“This is some real shit you’ve made.”
Mandri rolled on his side to try and flee the tortuous pain, but that somehow made it worse.
“Sol help me!”
“Yeah, well, all we got is Chopper.”
“Chop?” Chopper asked, staring at Mandri’s leg.
Moto snorted a laugh.
“I wish,” he said. “Oh, how I wish. Help me pick him up.”
Chopper jogged over, reached down, and the moment he touched Mandri’s demon-bitten thigh to lift him up, a searing pain shot through Mandri’s whole body and he fainted.</Text>

            <Title>Binks</Title>
            <Text>Purl offered Mandri a snack of binks. A bink was a yellow nut the size of a tooth, with black spots on either end. They were quite bitter. Mandri preferred the bland hardtack. Purl said that binks were better for him than hardtack because they had healing properties. She said that there were mice living in the Sand that, if he could believe it, subsisted entirely on binks. It gets them through the severest droughts. She once had a pet mouse and was careful to never let it drink. It lived on a diet of binks until the mousey old age of two. Mandri doubted the story, but he did not do so out loud, as earlier that day he’d seen her lagging behind the others looking like she was about to give up and die—feet dragging, head sagging, sobbing, nursing her injured arm like it were a dying cat. Elrahet and Moteah were there, walking in front of her, seemingly oblivious to the grief streaming down Purl’s face, or perhaps they had been the cause and didn’t care. Whatever the story, Mandri was careful around the girl because she had enough to deal with.</Text>

            <Title>Ch11 - Scratch</Title>
            <Text>It’s easy to think that a well-adjusted person puts so much effort into appearance because they care about how they are perceived. This is a misdiagnosis. A well-adjusted person doesn’t care what other people think of them, that’s what makes them well-adjusted. If a man like Moto took other people’s feelings into consideration, if he played up their wants and desires in his mind, how they might be judging him, well, that would lead to self-doubt, and that would lead to indecision, and sure as pure, that indecision would become a habit, leaving him perpetually anxious and uneasy. He would feel bad about looking so well-off amidst such squalor. He would adjust himself to fit in. He’d try to look miserable even if he wasn’t. And fickleness being what it is, ‘fitting in’ with other people is not a one-and-done thing, it’s a constant effort of adjustment and readjustment, so if a person has any kind of empathy at all, well, that precludes that possibility of being well-adjusted. A person is doomed to an unending labor of fitting in, or they’re well-adjusted and run roughshod over people’s lives. That takes some real, purposeful ignorance to be able to do, and Mandri could tell that Moto was filled right up to the flaring nose with that ignorance—again, Mandri knew this just by looking at him. But Mandri wasn’t judging only on looks. As they walked, Moto would go out of his way to step on fresh sprouts of grass. His leather sole would twist and squish the little shootlings into the ground as they tried to carve out a meager existence in between cracks of rock. A small cruelty, yes, but still a cruelty. Just a hop and skip away from chopping off Obo’s legs.

It left a bitter aftertaste in the air between them.

“Two questions, then,” Moto said quickly. “And give me thorough answers. First, how did you die, and second, why would someone carry your dead body all the way over the Hias and drop you in the Junei?”
“Well, the answer to your first question is that I was strangled by an insane person. The answer to your second question is, I don’t know.”

“It’s not either of those things. I’m telling you the truth.”
“But you’re not being thorough. This is the point of contention here—thoroughness. I want the truth and I want it in its fullness. You understand? I don’t want to be asking questions all day long. Understand?”
“I do.”

“Hey, Hill!”
Both men stopped and turned around.
“Whaddya want!?” the stout Hill answered.
The other man was the bald idiot named Chopper. Chopper’s backpack was so big that he looked like a pack animal, his silhouette a bloated blob of burlap plopped atop two stick-skinny legs.
Moto shouted, “You got any rope?”
“If you want rope”, said Hill, “you come an get it.”
Moto ushered Mandri along the road, and they met up with Hill and Chopper. Hill had unslung his own heavy pack and was straddling it, digging around for a length of coiled rope.
“What you need it for?” Hill asked.
“Don’t worry about it,” Moto said.
Hill screwed up his ugly mug and said, “Last time I lent you rope, you cut it.”
“I won’t cut it.”
“That’s what you said last time.”
Moto rubbed his brow in exasperation. He said, “I can’t tell you what I need it for, because that would ruin it.”
Hill pulled out a thick coil of flat-rope, but was hesitant to hand it over.
“How’s that?” he asked.
“I’m gonna teach this boy a lesson.”
“What kinda lesson he gonna learn? You gonna get him killed, ain’t ya?”
“No one’s going to die.”
“That’s what you said last time.”
“When was that?”
“When you shot at little Kinzy in that bugee tree.”
“I fully intended to kill Kinzy.”
“Horseshit.”
Moto held out his hand like a tax-collector, and said, “Give me the rope.”
Hill recoiled in disgust. He coddled his rope against his chest as if it were a gift from Solraheen. Hill asked again, “What you need it for?”
“I already told you—I can’t tell you.”
Hill looked to Mandri and sneered.
“I spent too much time on this rope to let it go to waste.”
“Give it here,” said Moto.
“Make it yourself!”
“Give it here.”
“Use your own rope.”
“I don’t have any.”
“That’s no problem of mine!”
Hill began to stuff the rope back into his pack, but was stopped when Moto put a hand on his shoulder and said, “Hill, if you don’t give it to me, I’m going to take it.”
Hill’s big lips quivered in anger, and he raised the rope high in his clenched fist, knuckles white, and shouted, “You already owe me forty feet!”
“It’s not your rope,” said Moto. “It’s Ayram’s.”
Hill’s mouth went wide in shock, revealing a rather unsightly set of chipped and twisted teeth. A deep sense of injustice plagued the rest of his pitted features. And when this was not enough to put Moto off, Hill threw the rope at Moto’s feet, gathered up his pack, and said, “I’m gonna tell Ayram about this.”
“Be sure that you do.”
“I will.”
“Tell him we’ll be at one of the lizard pits near beetle bleak.”

            <Title>Shulgi</Title>
            <Text>There were three people in Ayram’s backpack. Two were dead—Obo and the Riga—and their elbows, shoulders, wrists, and hips bulged the bottom leather. Elrahet sat on top of them, her head was poked out the top, ancient but very much alive. She glared out at the rest of the Ayramun who lagged behind.
“Faster!” she barked. 
The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a wide canyon valley, but Ayram’s pace was furious, and he scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree, and Mandri had a hard time following. At the top was a shelf of sturdy rock, and they bumbled along this parallel road for a finger until it dead ended into a crack which ran right through a solid wall of reddish stone. The crack’s opening was hardly an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders, but Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
 Mandri’s arms and legs bumped and scraped against the striated walls, layers of red and off-red rock stacked on top each other composed dramatic sweeping forms that towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky. The sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he ran along, and such was the height and cant of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mushy pile of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
Mandri might have savored the scene if he wasn’t having such a hard time keeping up with the blistering pace. The way twisted and bent, right and left, and he was so far behind that he rarely caught a glimpse of Purl, much less anyone else beyond her. He was chasing the sounds of their paddling feet, and that was enough until he was confronted with a fork in the path. The Ayramun had charged ahead without sparing care for him.
Mandri forced himself up and he scuttled onwards, finding untapped energy in his legs. This new path curved around and almost ran back on itself, then gradually meandered north. The way was rough, and soon a whole hand had passed, measured out by the oppressive eye of the sun as it crossed the thin bridge of blue above. The air was heating up, and unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off Mandri’s skin the moment it beaded up. He ran on and on, and the longer he ran, the soggier his robe and brow became. Few feelings are more uncomfortable than that of a soggy lower back being patted by a heavy pack. The vortex of steamy air that emerged there in that gap was a weather system unto itself, and this self-sustaining convection current, shaped by the contours of muscle and spine, was there to stay as he didn’t have time to throw off his pack, rip off his shirt, and rag himself dry.

“No backtalk—and that goes for you too, Seb. You been getting uppity these days, and it’s time to stop.”
Seb scoffed at this sudden turn. 
“I don’t backtalk,” he said. “I give suggestions.”
“No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
When Ayram was confident that Seb had absorbed enough of his ire to fall in line, he turned again to Mandri.
“You understand?”
Mandri nodded.
“Say it.”
“I understand.”
“Good—but for now you’ll be following Moto.”
Moto perked up. “Me? Where are you going?”
“I’m going to scout for the Hrks,” said Ayram. Then he added, smiling, “and if I happen to smash a demon’s skull on the way, then the world is better for it.”
“Where you want to meet up?”
“Greskalun or no Greskalun, we’re going to Shulgi. If the Mazyd was right, it will be empty. We’ll meet up there, in the highest columned room. If you’re not there, don’t worry…I’ll find you.”
With that, he grabbed his iron spear and leapt up the western slope, jumping from rock to rock with a dexterous, grace that defied his giant frame.
His leaving left an uneasy silence which stayed unbroken until Elrahet growled in disappointment. Without Ayram to carry her, she’d have to walk.
She climbed out of the pack and stretched her legs.
“Whose going to carry these two?” She asked, kicking the bag of bodies.
Moto, standing a little straighter now that he was in charge, said, “I think it’s time Mandri pulled his own weight.”
Moto reached down into Ayram’s pack and pulled out Obo’s pale and lifeless corpse by the neck. Then he grabbed Mandri’s litter and stuffed Obo into it as best he could.
“I’ll carry Obo,” Mandri said, “but I’m telling you, I cannot carry both of them. My back is already near breaking.”
Moto froze, looked Mandri square in the eye and said, “You’ll do what I tell you to do.” This was, unquestionably, a threat of violence. Mandri shrank back and raised his hands to surrender. Moteah laughed.
“You got something to say?” Moto asked to his sister.
“Oh come on,” said Moteah. “Look at him. He’s a twig, he can’t carry all that.”
Moto’s jaw went tight. He stood up even straighter. His nose flared as he sniffed that elevated air of authority. He pointed a finger at Moteah and declared, “Then you will carry the Riga.”
Moteah scoffed and settled into an incredulous pose, hand-on-sidethrust-hip, and not to be outskilled in art of finger-wagging, she flicked hers right back at Moto and said, “How about, for once, you take up the weight when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a slapback lizard unfurling it’s frills he rolled back and puffed his chest.
Seb spat a wad of borcandi juice in between the siblings. “I’ll carry it,” he grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop barkin’ and we can get on with it, I’ll carry the damn thing.”
“There’s no room in your pack,” said Moto.
“For Sol’s sake, lash it to my back then.”
Seb unshouldered his pack and dropped it at Moto’s feet. Moto, unhappy with Seb’s act of charity, kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he pulled the limp Riga child up and out of Ayram’s sagging pack. A few wraps and knots of vinecord later, and the dead Riga was fixed into a makeshift harness against Seb’s pack. 
Seb bore his new burden with the stolidity of an ox, and he charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though his springy kick-step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the weight. It was a frightful sight, the Riga child. It was swaddled in black from head to toe, bundled like a block of meat, and as Seb walked the child’s head lolled from side to side.
Elrahet followed after him, and then Purl followed after her, and then Moteah brushed by her brother with a smirk.
Obo hadn’t fit neatly into Mandri’s pack—he’d been squashed down into the side of it, and his arms were folded up and stuck straight up into the air like a rabbit’s ears. When Mandri got the pack settled on his shoulders, the bouncing unset the arms and the elbows went limp and the forearms banged against the back of Mandri’s head.
Moto stopped him from fixing the issue.
“Walk,” he said, and Mandri walked, and they walked like that until they 
As day progressed the canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky overhead dimmed into purpler hues. It was near the golden hour when their path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau.
Mandri turned and admired the distance covered and was startled to see a bewildering maze of canyon cracks that stretched out for miles before fading into the dark rift of the Pass. They had made it out in one piece. They had made it to the home of the Greskalun—Shulgi, a sanctuary, a structure at once a building and a mountain, at once a fat, flat-topped chunk of natural stone and a richly ornamented temple whose walls were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes—circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles, and these shapes joined together to roughly resemble faces—animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval the size of two-floor building demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the nose of a snarling demon. It was patterns inside of patterns, lines inside of lines. And one must crane the neck to look up at it, for Shulgi was set on top of a sloping hill of rock rubble, rubble laid down by both the despoiling hands, time and humanity.
Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders of humanity get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights Shulgi should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered serve well to heighten the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the crown of crowns, and that’s even after accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays made the structure seem to burst in flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they’d have a much easier time of it because the building was a hollow husk. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arches, each as empty of candlelight as the next. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a pretty lizard woman. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
Moto jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramless file. He led them all up the well-trodden slope to the foot of a long flight of stairs that led up to the temple entrance. These were troublesome stairs and there were at least a hundred of them, and they were steep and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms for they each had their own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.
Three steps up and Mandri noticed a dark stain climbing up the stairs with him as he went. He guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be a number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement—a temple that large had to have drainage somewhere, though yes, it would be odd that they’d have it running out the front door. 
But he knew it was blood. 
Of course it was blood. There were demons about and no people where people were expected to be—it had to be blood. Blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under skin, it explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple’s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. Then his eyes alighted on the temple entrance, which itself had been sculpted in that curvilinear language into the head of a viper. It’s fangs were similarly stained by that dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the building itself had eaten the Greskalun. 
They crossed the pillared court at decent clip. Moto drew his sword as if he were about to do battle with the building itself. He stopped before crossing the threshold, he peered inside, then drew away and said, “We’ll wait for Ayram somewhere else.”
Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion, “I’m not going back down,” she said. “I climbed up these steps and I’ll be damned if I don’t stick my head in and see what’s happened.”
“No,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram said that we should only wait inside the temple if it was empty.”
“Someone get a torch going,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moteah was a step ahead of her, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks that Purl was holding. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.
Moto yanked the torch out of Purl’s hands.
“Ayram put me in charge,” he said.
Elrahet sneered and said, “Take charge of your wits and march yourself inside. Or you can run away and explain to Ayram why you left his witch all alone.”
Moto stewed in a wordless anger. Composed himself, and thrust the torch into the temple interior. 
As soon he did, a swarm of bats screeched in the darkness and took flight. Their wingbeats battered the torch smoke as they swirled out of the viper’s mouth. The bats swerved along the temple wall and then disappeared back into some unseen hole.
Elrahet snarled and said, “Aren’t you a little big to be scared of bats?”
“There’s more than bats in there and you know it,” Moto declared. “It smells too foul to be empty.”
“He’s right,” said Purl. “It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“I suppose you would know.”
“Get a move on,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone filtered in behind. Mandri made sure he was last to enter.
Shulgi’s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a barge, and thrice as long. The torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dugout into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that was filled to the brim with white ash. Wind and time had swept some of this ash around the room, with trails of it sprinkling the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing the Ayramun, was a man sitting cross-legged.
Moto waved his torch back and forth. The man did not move. Moto shouted, “Hello there!”, but his words echoed unheard around the room. The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was his bald, ash splattered head.
“Probably dead,” marked Seb.
“Oh, you think so?” said Moto.
“You’re the one that said ‘hello’ to it.”
Elrahet held out her hand towards Moto and made a grasping motion, requesting the torch. Moto handed it over, and with it’s light leading the way, she hobbled towards the mysterious figure.
“He must’ve been eating mice,” said Moto as he kicked a the small spine that was lying on the floor.
“Or bats,” said Seb.
Now that Mandri knew they were there, he was noticing the scattered remains of creatures all over the place—thin boned lizard legs, bats, perhaps foxes, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. 
Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that cross-legged figure and poked him hard with her staff.
The man fell onto his side. The thud of his impact kicked up a cloud of ash.
“He is indeed dead,” Elrahet declared. “And he is a not a man, or not wholly a man, I should say.”
She bent down and rubbed the dead man’s robe in between her fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “This is the raiment of Greskal’s prince. Is that what you are, do you think? Are you young Greskaleen, or a scrounger with a stolen robe?”
Elrahet’s inquisitive demeanor gave Mandri the courage to carry himself into the room. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be ‘inside’—that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so long wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were dead bats and a dead body? So what if there were demons lurking in the shadows? It was good to flaunt these ominous things because if he didn’t, he’d probably faint. He wanted desperately to steel himself against the fear because he’d noticed a faint golden glimmer in the back of the room. He walked towards, and his wish came true, there was indeed, at the back of the entrance hall, shining faintly in the torch’s dancing light, an enormous golden statue of Solraheen.
As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a rare Old Jandri from where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling—a form outlawed by Hrk for this was sacrilegious to suggest that He did not belong to Jeket. Here, His golden skin is smooth and His body featureless. His face is round, alive, and enlightened. His pose is rigid as a board, as if someone who had never sat before had the act described to them in a dream. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to reality. It was more primitive and therefore more true. And it was huge, at least ten feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.
It was a beautiful sight. No doubt the source of Mandri’s newfound serenity. None of it glittered as brightly as Mandrameen might have wanted, for a thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash had speckled His cheek. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. But what could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen’s golden skin darkly mottled, tarnished.
Mandri winced at such impiety. Pure gold cannot tarnish, and so this meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals. No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their suffering. And worse—standing by Solraheen’s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine. Now, he could not say for certain what this urine was for, but there was a narrative proximity here which couldn’t be ignored. Surely—surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.
One indignity to wash away another.
“They should have settled for a smaller statue,” Mandri mumbled.
“What’s that?” croaked Elrahet.
Mandri pointed to the statue. “It’s tarnished,” he said.
“What of it?”
“It’s not pure gold.”
“Oh, swogglebottom. The good Lord does not care about gold. What He really cares about is this man here,” she poked the dead man again with her cane, “And that poor thing there.” She pointed with the torch to a dark lump sitting not ten feet away from Mandri. 
Mandri jump back and gasped. The round lump lurking in the shadows had an ear. It had a mop of dark hair. It was the back of a severed head. A few links of its vertebral column were still attached. What flesh there was looked like it had been gnawed on.
“The Mazyd was right,” said Elrahet. “Though it wasn’t hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.”
Mandri . He said, “Are you saying that this green robe guy ate that other guy over there?” 
Elrahet nodded. “It was his final meal.”
“Ok, we’re leaving,” said Moto.
“No,” said Elrahet. “The struggle in this room is over.”
“We should burn it.”
“Nonsense. This was one of Solraheen’s champions. Don’t be so quick to judge those touched by the darkness, for there is no greater struggle. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it took him completely. See here… he was growing horns.”
She turned the man’s chin upright with the tip of her cane, and sure enough, there were two fleshy nubs protruding from his forehead. His jaw lolled open, and a too-long tongue unfurled onto the floor.
“If he had lost his battle, this world’s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand.”
She held the torch low to the firepit, and she poked around it with her cane to reveal, half buried in ash, a round stomach still full with that final meal. The green-robed man had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it the intestines behind, and these he’d cut too and tossed into the ash. The stomach was black, nearly as black as Fabled Black, and while that might be expected for flesh cooking in flames, it seemed to Mandri that it was black for other reasons. If the torchlight was truthful, the stomach was still wet and still subtly pumping.
Elrahet pulled out her golden knife and cut the stomach open without effort. She opened the halves with tip of her cane as if to divine it.
Now, divination is an art of which Mandri knew very little. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ is subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance—there’s the stomach’s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the meaning of current events but predict the future. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach, that he would understand anything about what was going on. But when that stomach snapped open, the stomach itself let loose a black puff of smoke that struck Mandri dumb with dread.
He was not the only one. All present shuddered and gasped.
“Oooookay,” said Moto. “We’re not waiting in here.”
Elrahet ignored him. With her blade she sorted through the stomach’s contents. Her sullen face was fraught with worry. 
“Did you not hear me? I said we’re leaving.”
“Don’t have to tell me twice,” said Seb, and he scuttled out the door.
“Evidently I do,” Moto said derisively. But no one else had budged.
“Elrahet,” he said, “Please just do what I ask you to do.”
Elrahet snapped and said, “Go look for Ayram.”
Moto’s shoulders sank. He looked despondently up at the ceiling, and tried to rub the frustration out of his forehead. Then he clapped his hands, and said, “Alright. Alllllright. If a demon falls down from the ceiling and starts making your insides be outsides, don’t complain to me.”
  He threw his pack down, pulled from it a rock crystal spyglass and hurried out into the oncoming night to watch for Ayram’s coming.
Elrahet shouted after him like a worried mother.
“Don’t stray too far!”
And like every son with his own ideas, Moto ignored her.
Mandri decided to follow him, because the divination of entrails was not for him. He set his Obo-stuffed pack against an ash-brushed column, and joined Moto as well as Seb outside on the temple’s doorstep. 
The evening breeze was a revelation, it told of just how foul the air in that hall really was. Mandri took a deep breath of it, hoping to clear the taint of that vile stomach from his senses. He thought he could still smell it. He could certainly still see it in his mind’s eye, and now that he was thinking about it he wanted to vomit.
 He grimaced and thought of prettier things. The sun was now a bright pink line in the west and that pinkness washed over a smattering of faint stars who were just beginning to twinkle. The fractured face of the plateau below nearly mirrored the color of the sky. All this would have been enough to drag Mandri’s thoughts away from that black and belching stomach, but Seb was sitting at the head of Shulgi’s stairs, sitting on top of his pack with that dead Riga child still bundled to it, and the man was slurping and chewing his borcandi spines with unusual ferocity.
“How many of those spines do you have?” Mandri asked him. “You’ve been chewing them nonstop since I met you.”
Seb puckered his lips and sent a wad of spit flying down the stairs. He watched it until it disappeared, then said, “I chew ‘em till there ain’t nothin’ left. A single spine goes a day. Seven a week. Got a hundred and two left.” He gave his pack a few hearty slaps and the Riga’s head juddered.
“I know you took a burgeon,” he said.
“A burgeon? What are you talking about?”
“Uh-huh.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“You see anythin’ special?”
Mandri turned and looked for Moto. The man had climbed up above Shulgi’s entrance arch. He was sitting sideways in the circle of the viper’s eye, scanning the distance for Ayram.
Seb said, “I can see the Hrks.”
“Where?” Mandri asked.
“You must be blind, ‘cause I’m half-blind an’ I can see ‘em.”
He pointed out to the cracked expanse again. Mandri expected to see a white line marching out on top of it. Then he saw a faint orange glow flickering in one of the distant cracks. In fact there were two bright spots, glowing, one further back, seemingly stuck and not moving, and one maybe halfway out, wandering in the wrong direction. Outside of these two blooms of light, the canyon curves were many times blacker than the night that was creeping in. Trying to find Ayram in them would, no doubt, be a hopeless endeavor. 
Mandri asked Seb, “Ayram’s not going to fight them all, is he?”
Seb spat again, and lubricated his lips with his tongue before speaking. 
“He’s layin’ a false trail,” he said. “Helpin’ the Hrks get turned around in them canyons is be easy to do, ‘specially at night. Lots of places to get lost. Ya know they don’t call it the Shattered Plateau for nothin’. Its got doublin’ back places, sideways places, and whatnot. Hard to just keep goin’ straight.”
“Where is he?”
“You’d have to have the eyes of a bat to find Ayram in those canyons.” 
Moto voice called out from behind, “I see him!”
“That was quick.”
Mandri looked down at the crack that led up Shulgi, half-expecting to see Ayram charging out of it and leaping up the steps, but he wasn’t there nor anywhere else. Mandri scanned up and down all the cracks that weren’t so obscured by canyon curves, but he saw nothing. 
“He’s so god-damned fast,” Moto declared as he rolled his disbelief, jealousy, and admiration into a sigh. This was, Mandri supposed, the closest Moto could come to actually expressing something resembling respect. It made Mandri want to find Ayram all the more. He realized he’d never actually seen the giant sprinting. Ayram doing anything was a physical feat, he could be taking a shit and Mandri would want front row seating.
Still, he saw nothing.
Moto said, “If I didn't know better, I'd say that he's spooked.”
Seb twisted around and said to Moto, “What makes you say you know better?”
“It's Ayram. The man doesn't get spooked.”
Mandri, eager to be included, said, “I don’t see him. Where is he?”
Seb pretended to wonder if Mandri was blind, then pointed out at the shattered plateau, and said, “He’s right there.”
“I don’t see—oh.”
The reason Mandri hadn’t seen Ayram is because Ayram wasn’t weaving his way through the dark canyons, he was out on top of the plateau, looking a bit like a flea on the back of a scaled lizard hide. He was sprinting towards the temple, leaping across the canyon gaps as he went. Some of these gaps were larger than Mandri thought was possible to traverse, but as Ayram jumped, he stabbed the ground with spear and practically threw himself across. The speed and power was incredible, even viewed so far away. 
“Shit!” Moto yelled. He clambered out of the snakes eye, and when the distance was manageable, he jumped down. His eyes were alight with worry. He grabbed Mandri under the arm and said, “Get inside.”
“What is it?”
“Damn it, get inside!”
He threw Mandri back towards the temple and started to manhandle Seb.
Seb shook his arm free from Moto’s grip. “What’re you on about?”
“Do not argue with me, Seb. Get inside, or I’ll make you.”
“What’s got you so—”
Moto grabbed Seb’s shoulder and lifted him up. Seb, being the much smaller man, didn’t fight it, though he did make it as hard as he could letting his heels drag. Moto dragged him right past Mandri, gave him a look that could boil bone.
“If you don’t get your ass inside…” he said, and he left Mandri to imagine the details.
Mandri ran after him, but took one last look out at the shattered plateau. Ayram was still hurtling towards the temple. He was rapidly approaching a crevasse that would, surely, be too wide for even him to jump. 
He didn’t slow down.
“No way,” Mandri muttered.
Afore the gap, Ayram’s stride lengthened into a bounding skip—one, two, three—his fourth step pressed off the edge of the crevasse, and he launched himself into the air. His momentum was incredible.
Suddenly, from out towards the pass, a thin beam of golden fire exploded into the night, zipping right towards Ayram. It rushed at the speed of a lightning flash, and so brilliant was its light that Mandri couldn’t help but blink.
When he opened his eyes, Ayram was gone. A cloud of dust swirled in his wake. A long black scorch mark scarred his landing zone.
Moto’s hand grabbed the neck of Mandri’s robe and pulled him into the temple, and without so much as a word of warning, Moto dropped him on the floor.
“What was that?” Moteah asked. She had seen the flash but not the source.
Moto shouldered his pack and said, simply, “Mazydfire”.
“How close?”
Moto did not answer. He marched through the hall and stopped next to Elrahet. He asked her, brusquely, “Where to?”</Text>

            <Title>Ch22 - Scratch</Title>
            <Text>There were three people in Ayram’s backpack. Two were dead—Obo and the Riga—and their elbows, shoulders, wrists, and hips bulged the bottom leather. Elrahet sat on top of them, her head was poked out the top, ancient but very much alive. She glared out at the rest of the Ayramun who lagged behind.
“Faster!” she barked. 
The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a wide canyon valley, but Ayram’s pace was furious, and he scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree, and Mandri had a hard time following. At the top was a shelf of sturdy rock, and they bumbled along this parallel road for a finger until it dead ended into a crack which ran right through a solid wall of reddish stone. The crack’s opening was hardly an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders, but Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
Everyone followed, like a line of mice returning to its den, everyone except Mandri. He hesitated before entering, for if demons were supposed to be haunting the Goree, then a shadowed crack like this was surely where they were hiding. Then the sound of a distant Hrkan horn blaring behind him kicked him back in into motion.
 Mandri’s arms and legs bumped and scraped against the striated walls, layers of red and off-red rock stacked on top each other composed dramatic sweeping forms that towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky. The sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he ran along, and such was the height and cant of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mushy pile of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
Mandri might have savored the scene if he wasn’t having such a hard time keeping up with the blistering pace. The way twisted and bent, right and left, and he was so far behind that he rarely caught a glimpse of Purl, much less anyone else beyond her. He was chasing the sounds of their paddling feet, and that was enough until he was confronted with a fork in the path. The Ayramun had charged ahead without sparing care for him.
His first instinct was to ask Obo. Obo would know which way they would have gone. But Obo was dead at the bottom of Ayram’s pack.
His next instinct was to try to hone in on the sound of Elrahet’s grumbling. But faint echoes are a difficult thing to judge when the paths before him curved away and curved back and on into indeterminable directions.
The reliable thing to do was to look for footprints, but the sandy blend preserved impressions that headed in either direction. Then came a stroke of inestimable genius—Ayram has big feet. Mandri searched the ground for largest, heaviest print, and sure enough he found it heading off to the left. He would have rejoiced at the sight if there weren’t another footprint right next to it, the print of a foot which bore no resemblance to any in Mandri’s imagination—half-man with human toes, half-lizard with claws splayed out and digging into the dirt. It was, no doubt, a demon’s print.
Mandri forced himself up and he scuttled onwards, finding untapped energy in his legs. This new path curved around and almost ran back on itself, then gradually meandered north. The way was rough, and soon a whole hand had passed, measured out by the oppressive eye of the sun as it crossed the thin bridge of blue above. The air was heating up, and unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off Mandri’s skin the moment it beaded up. He ran on and on, and the longer he ran, the soggier his robe and brow became. Few feelings are more uncomfortable than that of a soggy lower back being patted by a heavy pack. The vortex of steamy air that emerged there in that gap was a weather system unto itself, and this self-sustaining convection current, shaped by the contours of muscle and spine, was there to stay as he didn’t have time to throw off his pack, rip off his shirt, and rag himself dry.
Eventually the crack belled out into a short and wide stripe of valley. It was a miniature valley of sorts, as it was only there because a great length of the rock on either side had collapsed. It was as if a giant fist had punched the ground here, leaving a mound of red rubble slouching in the valley’s belly, clogging it up. But enough of the shattered rock had been cleared away to make a thin, passable trail. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope was the Goree’s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision, and above that, the latter-day sun was blazing down on the great red crumbs of boulders. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were the Ayramun. They were sitting, waiting for Mandrameen.
Moteah was the first to notice his coming.
“There he is,” she said, as if they’d been waiting for years.
“I told you he was right behind,” said Purl.
“That is stretching the definition of ‘right behind’.”
Moto stood up, stretched his back, and said, “Time to go.”
Mandri pretended not to hear. If they had gotten a break, so would he. He wandered up into the shade of the nearest fallen rock and unshouldered his pack.
Seb said, “Moto’s right. If them Hrks found our trail, we best be moving.”
Elrahet, still burrowed inside Ayram’s pack, said, “We’ll give the boy a moment.”
Mandri dumped that great weight off his shoulders, and it was like taking the lid off a steaming pot. The coolness that brushed his sweaty back. He pulled off his tunic, and that, too, was glorious. He sat down a rock next to Purl, elbows on his knees, but sitting was not enough. He wanted to lay down, though with all the rubble, there wasn’t a good place for it. Then his eyes alighted on a veritable couch of a boulder, a smooth, sway-backed sandstone couch that he could melt onto. He stood up and made to climb up to it. His first step up onto the eastern slope sent a trickle of sandstone crumbs tumbling down from above. 
Purl said, “What are you doing?” 
“I’m gonna lay down on that rock up there,” Mandri said.
“Don’t.”
“I’m not going to nap or anything. I’m gonna to lay down for a moment.”
He took another step up, and then Ayram yelled out, “Down!”. He seemed to be giving commands to a dog.
Mandri relented. That blessed rock was not that high up, maybe only six feet or so. He could climb up and jump down without a fuss, so why shouldn’t he be allowed to do it? Because he’d be left behind? Because Ayram said so? 
That usurped his good sense, and rebellion swelled up in his chest. He turned to the Ayram, who was snacking on a ribbon of jerky, half of which stuck-out of his mouth and  waved at Mandri with every munch.
“Can I ask you something?” Mandri asked.
He didn’t wait for Ayram to finish chewing.
“Why do you care what I do with myself?”
Ayram’s thick black brows jumped up in amazement. He snapped off his jerky, shoved the rest into his cheek, then said, “You want to climb up there and have a rest?”
“I do,” said Mandri. “But look, I won’t do it if you don’t want me to—it’s just that I never signed up for any of this.”
“You didn’t?”
“I’m not Ayramun. You’re a goddamned giant, so I’ll do what you want, but I’m not, you know…” The immense indifference of Ayram’s stare broke Mandri’s indignation and made him lose his train of thought. Mandri shuffled around for the right words, and when he couldn’t find them, he circled back around to where he started. “I mean, why do you care what I do? If I take a short rest and fall behind, then I fall behind, so what?”
Amusement flashed inside of Ayram’s bushy beard and he snorted a laugh, the kind of laugh that could start a fight. And he wasn’t the only one looking at Mandri like he’d lost his mind. It was a whole crowd of stunned, almost disgusted glares, as if Mandri were one of those smelly old men who do nothing but wallow in the gutter and extol the richness of poverty, the joys of sorrow, the virtues of vice, and annoy everyone with visions of the end of the world.
“What’s so funny?” said Mandri. He was careful to say it in Seb’s direction.
Purl said, “Are you blind?”
“No,” said Mandri.
Purl pointed up the crumbled slope. “Then you must be dumb,” she said, “because there’s a demon right there.”
Mandri looked and saw nothing but a bunch of red rocks and that sway-backed block of sandstone. 
“I don’t see shit,” he said.
“Okay, you are blind, then.”
Purl bent down, picked up a rock, then side-armed it up the slope.  
The rock smacked into a boulder.
The boulder flinched and flashed it’s yellow fangs.
“Oh, shit!”
The demon was right there—right there—squatting plain as day above the stone on which Mandri planned to rest. It was a hairless red demon whose rock-patterned skin blended it so neatly with the sandstone that as it settled back into its imperious squat, Mandri briefly lost sight of it. He might not have been able to find it again if it weren’t for the organic line of its corded muscle roping around its arms and legs. And these were human arms and legs, or rather, human-ish, for these limbs were grossly elongated, almost birdlike, and it’s feet and hands were something else entirely. The feet were taloned and hawkish, and the fingers were curled and clawed like those of a long-lived pillow lizard. It’s face was a more compact mixture of the grotesque—the scrunched-up snout of a flat-faced pig, the nose and drooling flews of a hunting hound, as well as the outsized skull of a newborn babe. It’s skin was lizard skin. Its eyes were yellow, snake-slitted, squinting, unblinking, and fixated on Mandrameen. 
“You’re not gonna kill it!?” Mandri shouted.
Ayram did nothing but laugh. 
“It’s not worth the effort”, said Moto.
“But it’s a demon!”
“Go ahead,” said Moteah. “You have a sword, don’t you? If you want to kill it, then kill it.”
Eyed it up. The memory of its large teeth loomed large in his imagination.
“Well, I’m not confident in my demon slaying abilities.”
“None of us are,” said Purl. “A demon is hard to kill. It’s easy to wound, but if that’s all you do it’s going to run away, and then you have to chase it.”
“You’ve only got to worry if there’s more than one,” said Moteah. “You’ll be fine as long as you don’t present yourself as meat.”
Mandri couldn’t believe what he was hearing. “What about those pilgrims on those poles? That thing needs to be put down. What if it follows us?”
“It won’t do anything,” Ayram said. “That creature is as scared of me as you are of it. And it’s as dumb as a hammer.”
“It is?”
“Purl hit it with a rock and it still thinks that we can’t see it. You had eye contact with the damned thing, and it’s still thinks that you don’t know its there.”
Then Ayram he reached down, grabbed an Ayram-sized stone to throw and turned the heavy thing around in his hand until he found a good grip. Then he fixed his gaze on the demon, and like whip he , and he zipped that rock straight at that demon’s mouth.
SMACK!
The rock exploded into fragments and dust.
The demon shrieked in surprise. Blood gargled out of it’s smashed up snout and it tumbled back against the rocky slope. It tried to scramble upright, but Ayram’s stone had robbed its legs of confidence. It juddered and slipped and fell again. It’s face was such a bloody, broken mess that Mandri almost felt bad for it. It didn’t take long for the demon to gather it’s bearings and scramble up the eastern slope on all fours, body low to the ground, leaping boulder to boulder. When it disappeared above the valley rim, Ayram bellowed out an exultant “Yih!”, and this sent another turn of chuckling through the Ayramun. 
The violence put an energy into Ayram. He seemed rejuvenated. A man who means what says, , loosened him to. He waved a grand arm towards the boulder of Mandri’s desire. “Your rock is safe,” he said. “You can climb up there and lay down for as along as you like. Me and mine will continue on.”
“I’ll follow you,” said Mandri.
“If you follow me a step further, you are mine, do you understand?”
Mandri nodded. He didn’t understand.
“If you ever talk to me like I’m one of them, I’ll run you through. Do you understand?”
#
“No backtalk—and that goes for you too, Seb. You been getting uppity these days, and it’s time to stop.”
Seb scoffed at this sudden turn. 
“I don’t backtalk,” he said. “I give suggestions.”
“No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
When Ayram was confident that Seb had absorbed enough of his ire to fall in line, he turned again to Mandri.
“You understand?”
Mandri nodded.
“Say it.”
“I understand.”
“Good—but for now you’ll be following Moto.”
Moto perked up. “Me? Where are you going?”
“I’m going to scout for the Hrks,” said Ayram. Then he added, smiling, “and if I happen to smash a demon’s skull on the way, then the world is better for it.”
“Where you want to meet up?”
“Greskalun or no Greskalun, we’re going to Shulgi. If the Mazyd was right, it will be empty. We’ll meet up there, in the highest columned room. If you’re not there, don’t worry…I’ll find you.”
With that, he grabbed his iron spear and leapt up the western slope, jumping from rock to rock with a dexterous, grace that defied his giant frame.
His leaving left an uneasy silence which stayed unbroken until Elrahet growled in disappointment. Without Ayram to carry her, she’d have to walk.
She climbed out of the pack and stretched her legs.
“Whose going to carry these two?” She asked, kicking the bag of bodies.
Moto, standing a little straighter now that he was in charge, said, “I think it’s time Mandri pulled his own weight.”
Moto reached down into Ayram’s pack and pulled out Obo’s pale and lifeless corpse by the neck. Then he grabbed Mandri’s litter and stuffed Obo into it as best he could.
“I’ll carry Obo,” Mandri said, “but I’m telling you, I cannot carry both of them. My back is already near breaking.”
Moto froze, looked Mandri square in the eye and said, “You’ll do what I tell you to do.” This was, unquestionably, a threat of violence. Mandri shrank back and raised his hands to surrender. Moteah laughed.
“You got something to say?” Moto asked to his sister.
“Oh come on,” said Moteah. “Look at him. He’s a twig, he can’t carry all that.”
Moto’s jaw went tight. He stood up even straighter. His nose flared as he sniffed that elevated air of authority. He pointed a finger at Moteah and declared, “Then you will carry the Riga.”
Moteah scoffed and settled into an incredulous pose, hand-on-sidethrust-hip, and not to be outskilled in art of finger-wagging, she flicked hers right back at Moto and said, “How about, for once, you take up the weight when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a slapback lizard unfurling it’s frills he rolled back and puffed his chest.
Seb spat a wad of borcandi juice in between the siblings. “I’ll carry it,” he grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop barkin’ and we can get on with it, I’ll carry the damn thing.”
“There’s no room in your pack,” said Moto.
“For Sol’s sake, lash it to my back then.”
Seb unshouldered his pack and dropped it at Moto’s feet. Moto, unhappy with Seb’s act of charity, kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he pulled the limp Riga child up and out of Ayram’s sagging pack. A few wraps and knots of vinecord later, and the dead Riga was fixed into a makeshift harness against Seb’s pack. 
Seb bore his new burden with the stolidity of an ox, and he charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though his springy kick-step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the weight. It was a frightful sight, the Riga child. It was swaddled in black from head to toe, bundled like a block of meat, and as Seb walked the child’s head lolled from side to side.
Elrahet followed after him, and then Purl followed after her, and then Moteah brushed by her brother with a smirk.
Obo hadn’t fit neatly into Mandri’s pack—he’d been squashed down into the side of it, and his arms were folded up and stuck straight up into the air like a rabbit’s ears. When Mandri got the pack settled on his shoulders, the bouncing unset the arms and the elbows went limp and the forearms banged against the back of Mandri’s head.
Moto stopped him from fixing the issue.
“Walk,” he said, and Mandri walked, and they walked like that until they </Text>

            <Text>The two of them farmed legumes, mainly stipple beans, broad beans, and the like. Mandri would give the beans to a woman in Meskalim, who would then smash them up to make a variety of curds. She’d sell the little curd-bricks and crunchy curd-skins, and she would give Mandri a share of the profit. It was never enough to buy both burgeons and food, so Mandri went hungry. Gil ate grass.

Then he sat against a comfortable nook in the tree trunk and watched his mind as it slowly turned away from the shame of walking away from Vigram’s. It was stupid of him to throw that away. How was he going to make money now? He’d probably have to sell himself to Geem.

            <Text>A Solitant will say that the Hrk is built upon Solraheen. A scribe will say that Hrk is built upon a complex system of laws, and these laws conform to a simple set of principles, and the first of these principles states that there is no greater being than Solraheen. For all the earthly power the Hrkan Lords wield, they remain subordinate to Him, and as such, any work of art which depicts a Hrkan Lord must, by law, incorporate some symbol of Solraheen, and this symbol must be placed somewhere higher than the Lord’s white-winged crown. Place the sun high in the sky or peeking through a window, that’s usually enough. A statue will often include a sunrose above the back of the head. Punishment for breaking this law is death for the offending artist, but like all laws in the Hrkan world, there are exceptions.

Mandri had seen Hrkan Lords and Hrkan Princes in the flesh. These were no great leaders of men. Few were much bigger than Mandri himself. He’d painted their portraits, these distant relations of the great Arnaggu, and he painted them three times the size of the real thing. He painted them into battles they’d never been in, he gave them victories they never won. These scenes were just like the one carved into that mountain—there stands the Hrkan Lord, glowering over the melee, trampling enemies underfoot as he marches at the head of an army ten-thousand strong. The man’s face is so vivid, so real, that no one ever disputes the facts presented on the canvas or wall.
If these were the descendants of Arnaggu, then no doubt Arnaggu himself was as small and frail, and perhaps he kept himself careening towards blacked out drunkenness like the rest of his distant kin. And like the rest, he’d be blinded even in his sober moments by his own imagined magnificence.

Sometimes, if a man is a whisker bigger than the rest, he gets called a giant when he doesn’t deserve it. 

He was a man who could command respect without coercion. His mere presence was coercion enough. As he stepped into the sun, a weight seemed to press down on Mandri’s shoulders, and his armpits began to sweat. He sweat so much that a little trickle dripped down his ribs. 

“Yes, my lord?” she croaked.
“Go fetch Purl,” said Ayram. It was a simple command, but issued in Ayram’s voice every word seemed a threat.
“But, my lord...”
Ayram clicked his tongue and the old woman grumbled, then shuffled back into the cave from which she had come.
All eyes returned to the Mazid kneeling in the sun. Obo seemed oddly at ease in the ire of his captors. He knelt there in the sand, stared at a spot of earth, and stayed silent as if in prayer.
Ayram looked the Mazid up and down. “I didn’t know they were so damn ugly,” he declared.
A few belly quaking chortles sounded out, most of them coming from Tob, who was quite pleased to see a Mazid so down on its luck. But if Obo was sunk in despair, he did not show it.
“Should I stand?” Obo asked them all. “I’ll stand so you all can get a better look.”


Obo turned to Ayram and said, “Are you going to kill me?”
Ayram shook his head.
Obo inspected his blood-nubbed arms and said, “So it’s just the torture, then?” 
“No torture,” said Ayram as his black loaf of a beard cracked open to reveal a clean smile. “You’ll to need the rest of your limbs. Your legs most of all. You can’t kneel to your new Lord if you don’t have knees.”
The rest of the Ayramun chuckled at Ayram’s menacing words.
So did Obo. He said, “I’m comfortable standing, thank you.”
“We’ll see,” said Ayram. he turned towards the darkness of the cave and yelled, “Elrahet!”


Obo said, “I will change your mind about me.”
“You killed fifteen of my people,” said Ayram.
“I did not have much of a choice.”
“You said that a Minder can’t make you do anything.”
“I did. But—”
“No! No, no, no. Stop talking—

            <Text>A man who expects too much sets out into the Sand alone. Unbeknown to him, a woman who expects too little sets out from the opposite direction. The two travelers happen to cross paths in the shifting middle of the Sand’s Empty Portion. They are hundreds of leagues from any farm or road, hundreds of years from anyone ever setting foot in that spot of the world again. It’s an unlikely convergence in space and time, in the most inhospitable desert, yet the man who expects too much will doubt the significance of this meeting. He actually expects to find a bit of strangeness out in the great sand sea—after all, the desert is large but the world is small and full of chance encounters. 
He looks at the woman who he has stumbled upon and all he can see is the fulfillment of expectation. That is all this meeting is to the man who expects too much. No need to invoke the name of Solraheen.
The other traveler, the woman who expects too little, is stunned by the significance of the moment. She did not expect to see another person in a place where no one else should be. After all, this part of the Sand is large and full of nothing. For this to happen, for two Sparks to meet in such a wasteland without intending to, well, it could not be a simple coincidence. She and he must have been brought together for some purpose.
Overwhelmed by this glimpse of the divine plan, she turns her eyes to the heavens and invokes the name of Solraheen.
The story ends there. It is nine long lines in the original Old Jandri script, nine lines scratched into an old clay tablet the size of a washing board. Some say the ending is missing, that there is another tablet hidden in a secret vault of some ancient city buried by time, waiting for providence to be revealed. Solitants preach that there must be another tablet, one which proves that the story is about Solraheen Himself. They say Solraheen is the man who expects too little. The woman is his bride. It is the story of their meeting.
But what do they know?
They’re freaks. Maybe that man was just a man and the woman was just a woman and that’s all there is to it. That’s what Seb Ugluu believed. Sometimes she’d dare to venture even further and say that the man and woman never existed at all and that the story is a fable.
She’d tell anyone who’d listen to her liquored up sermons that this story, the raw events, were not important. What was important was the lesson, and there was a lesson in those nine lines, a lesson that’s made easier to see by asking a few simple questions:
 What would have happened if the woman had journeyed into the desert and made it through safely without encountering a single Spark? 
Absolutely nothing. 
And if nothing had happened, would she have glimpsed the divine plan? 
Absolutely not.
She would have trudged along the ridges of the ergs, her shoulder set against the wind, head downcast, and she wouldn’t have given a single thought to Solraheen except to pray for her safety.
She never would have been overwhelmed by His mysteries.
She never would have shed a tear at the wonder of chance.
She never would have turned her eyes to the heavens and laced His name with magnificence.
And yet, Solraheen would have been there all the same. Solraheen’s hand is there and it is always there. It is there in the meeting, and it is there in the absence of it. It is there in the pain, and it is there in the pleasure. To be struck dumb by the sight of His plan in one instance and not the other is the same as to not see the plan at all. 
The key was to avoid expectations. Expectations turn the vividness of the present moment into an ignorable blur. 
Seb liked to put it a little more bluntly, “Expectations will get ya up the ass.”
She said it, and that’s how it was.
Of course, none of this stopped her from having expectations herself. No one is perfect. Not even Solraheen.
Seb was something of a mistress of low expectations, because thirty years of living in a desert land that most languages call Emptiness made it easy to keep expectations as low as possible.
Like clouds. Seb did not expect to see clouds. This close to the coast one might have expected to see a bit of moisture pluming the sky but Seb knew better. She knew how the Hias mountains shadowed the Junei hills from rain, how the Istil wind was too weak to carry water up and over those peaks. It was strange because the Hias were hardly mountains at all. The Burgos mountains, those were mountains, fully grown mountains with bald heads and stern granite faces frowning at pilgrims passing by. The Hias were nothing but big mounds of dirt pimpled with boulders. Chins tufted with thornscrub. The weakest watering wind should be able to make it up and over them.
The winds used to be able to do it, in some ancient age. The evidence was there in the foothills. She’d walked the ridges of the Hias and she’d looked east towards the Junei Plain where she could see the lighter orange clay of long-dried washes snaking through the red foothills for as far as there were foothills.
Of course, when she was down in those foothills she never noticed the washes. Down there she’d only seen sun baked clay and that clay was so hard that she couldn’t imagine it had ever seen rain. One night, Seb spit on the ground and when she woke, five whole hands later, that glob of spit was still there. The ground was so hard her spit couldn’t seep into it. Some of that might have to do with the fact that Seb’s spit was thick and sticky from all the borcandi spines she chewed, but still, it proved the point. It was like the ground had been dry for so long that it didn’t want to get wet. Like that story of the lonesome spearman who’d been at war for so long that when he returned home to the kindness of his wife he killed her. Just couldn’t deal with good loving. The Hias hills were like that. A lot of the Sand was like that. Hateful. Nothing lived in it.
Absolutely nothing.
There were lizards, but lizards were everywhere so they didn’t count. Piss on a rock, any rock, and some little lizard will scuttle out from nowhere to sip the urine. 
Birds didn’t count either because they’re only passing through. 
Beetles could be found by ripping the waxy bark off bamber trees. Sometimes Seb would have to bore all the way into the tree’s stringy, yellow core to find them. But green crust beetles don’t count as ‘something’. The problem with them is their shells guard a smell that makes the stomach curl, and that smell can’t be boiled or steamed, so they aren’t good eating, and as far as Seb was concerned, if it’s not good eating it might as well not exist. The only things worth paying any mind are things that kill and the things that keep alive, and those beetles were neither.
Everything else is nothing. 
There’s men out in the Sand, but men are boring. There’s women, but that’s all Seb would say about them—they’re out there. There were other things too, but mostly there was nothing. 
That’s what Seb saw as she stood atop one of the Junei foothills and looked out over the red and empty Junei plain—she saw nothing. Mostly she saw nothing because her eyes weren’t good at seeing way far out. Way far out was mostly a blur. But even if she could see, she knew there wouldn’t be a horizon because it’d be lost in the shimmer of a mirage, the kind that looks like water only it's not. A mirage was the perfect metaphor for how Seb viewed the Sand, because it looked like something, but really, it was nothing.
Lots and lots of nothing.
“Ey, Seb! There's somethin ‘ere!”
Seb’s ears pricked at the words. The shout had come from a nearby ravine.
Quick and spry as a lizard zipped up on spikeweed, Seb scrambled over to the lip of that ravine and peered down into its deep belly. One of her fellows was standing in the middle of it. All the Ayramun were swaddled from head to toe in brown or black wool dusted red by clay, but Seb knew it was Gugi down there because of the way he stood. Only Seb and Gugi stood with that twitchy restlessness that marks out a Jandri poke who’s not stopped chewing the spines of borcandi leaves since the day they were weaned off the tit. And Gugi was also a little taller than most. A little lankier. 
Gugi stuck his skinny arm up in the air and waved it towards Seb.
Seb sneered at his eagerness.
“Put your goddamned hand down,” Seb shouted. “I can see ya just fine.”
“Then get your ass down here!” Gugi shouted back.
Seb harrumphed, then started her climb down into the ravine.
As far as ravines go it seemed as full of nothing as any other ravine. It was steeper than most, and it was dry and dusty so Seb struggled to find purchase on the slope. She was forced into a clumsy half-scramble-half-slide to get down the bottom, which was about thirty yards down. Once there she took a moment to shake out the dirt that had fallen into her left boot.
The unexpected thing about this ravine was how even and straight it was, almost like a road. It went straight as an arrow for a full fifty yards before getting lost around a bend. This run was speckled with big dried out husks of karkle bushes. Gugi was standing in front of one of them, looking a little spooked.
Seb took her time ambling on over. She fingered a fresh borcandi spine out of her sleeve pocket as she went. She knew there wouldn’t be anything worth noticing because Gugi had a penchant for pointing out any old thing that caught his interest. Maybe there’d be a pricked-up drag-belly hissing inside that bush, but fat little lizards doing four-legged push-ups and flashing their ruddy throats weren’t worth shouting about. 
They weren’t something.
They were to be expected.
Part of the ignorable blur.
Gugi urged her on with an impatient flap of his hand. 
Seb laughed. “I ain’t gonna run in this heat.”
Gugi shook his head and mumbled something Seb couldn’t hear. 
“Pipe down, white light, I’m comin’.”
Seb eyed the karkle bush. There was definitely something hidden underneath its twiggy branches. A lumpy shape of something shadowed. Maybe a creature of some sort. Whatever it was, it was big, dark, unmoving, and apparently unconcerned with how Gugi was brushing the karkle’s branches aside to get a better look. 
“What is it?” Seb asked as she crouched next to Gugi.
“See for yourself,” Gugi said as he parted the bush’s brambles.
Seb peered down into the bush’s shadow. Her jaw went slack in surprise, and her barely-chewed borcandi spine slipped from her lip.
“Schisol’s shadow,” she muttered. 
There was a skeleton underneath that damned bush.
“Shit.”
“Ain’t it?” Gugi said, eyes open wide in frightened wonder. “Ya know, this is the first bush I looked under.”
“No. The first one?”
“Yep. It’s the first bush I looked under. I was like, this bush is in the perfect position, halfway-up, halfway-down, bet it will be the best spot to—”
“You sayin’ this is the first bush you looked under?”
“Yep.”
Gugi’s eyes weren’t lying. It was the first bush he’d looked under. There were at least forty other bushes in that dusty ravine, and the first one Gugi looks under has got a man missing muscles and skin. A quick glance around at the other bushes told Seb it was the only one that had something like this hiding inside.
This was really something.
A strange coincidence.
A divine sign.
Seb’s skin prickled.
She picked up her dropped borcandi spine, popped it back into her mouth, and resumed chewing with zeal. It was a little sandy, but Seb wasn’t going to waste a spine. Spines helped her think. They helped her find reasonable conclusions.
This body could be a prank.
She eyed Gugi with suspicion, for Gugi was a prankster. He had a prankster’s face—thin, with a long crooked nose and restless eyes. Bad skin, too. Mostly it was in the way he chewed his spines, open-mouthed, provocative, sigh-smiling. It was nasty, the way he chewed, because the man’s teeth were rubbed down to black and yellow nubs. Seb’s teeth were just the same, but she had the good sense to keep her mouth shut. Even when she talked, her lips worked hard to conceal the graveyard in her mouth.
Gugi said, “Ain’t fresh. And it don’t smell.”
“No shit it don’t smell. Thems picked clean.”
Gugi started playing a game of point-and-see, like he was want to do.
“Got an arm,” he said. “Both hands too, but they all scattered. Not a lick of skin.”
Seb rolled her eyes and squatted down to get away from Gugi’s inane observations. She peered under the low brim of the karkle’s branches.
“Gotta be a man,” she said.
Gugi squatted down next to Seb. “Help me get him out,” he said.
Seb noticed the ground around the bush was stepped on. She set an accusing eye on Seb and asked, “Did you put these bones here?”
“What? No.”
“Gugi. I’m only gonna ask one more time. Did you put these bones here?”
Seb couldn’t read Gugi’s face. The man was too well practiced in deceit. Only sometimes did Gugi’s eyes give things away, and this wasn’t one of those times.
“You think I’d kidnap some random bit’s bones, haul them all the way out here, then stuff ‘em up under this bush, just to stir you up?”
Gugi’s eyes still weren’t telling. Sometimes, if Seb paused and stared hard at Gugi, the guilt would get to him, and he’d give it up. 
“I didn’t do shit! Damn. I found it here like I said.”
“Then who put it here? Ain’t nobody jus’ crawl up under a random bush and die.”
“Could be a pilgrim,” Gugi replied. “He’s prolly some pilgrim that was headed for the pass. Crawled up under here to seek shade and forgot to wake up.”
“If that’s what happened, it’s even worse.”
“Why’s that?”
“Because it means a god put him here.”
“Gods are all dead.”
“Could mean a demon put it here. It’s what we call providence, one way or the other. Could be a curse.”
“It ain’t no curse. It’s jus’ bones.”
“There’s no such thing as ‘jus’ bones’. This goes with what I been sayin’ this whole time—we shouldn’t be settin’ up this damn ambush in these Spark scrubbin’ hills.”
“If it’s a curse, then let’s move it somewhere else, because I aim to use this bush. It’s the perfect spot.”
Seb couldn’t believe her ears. “You gonna hide in this bush?”
“I am,” said Gugi, without a hint of trepidation.
“You gonna hide in the one bush that’s got dead bones in it?”
“There won’t be no bones when we move ‘em. That’s why I need your help. Damn.” 
&quot;You lost your water? This the clearest shout of a cursed bush I ever heard. And more in point of fact, Ayram ought to hear about this. ‘Cause if this is the place where—&quot;
&quot;Don't worry Ayram ‘bout this shit. Jus’ help me move the damn thing.”
“Gugi, how do you not see what’s goin’ on here?”
“Grab his foot.”
“Gugi, listen to me—this here is Solraheen tellin’ you that if you hide in this bush, then you gonna die.”
“Grab his foot.”
“No.”
“I grab one, you grab the other.”
Gugi reached down and took a firm grip of the biggest bone in the dead left foot. He pulled it out and tossed it up and down. As he did, he said to Seb, “You know this body here—this body is the perfect chance for you to get to bother Elrahet.”
“How’s that?”
“You don’t think an old witch don’t want to look over a nice set of clean white bones? I bet if you bring a few bones with you, now you got something to pester her with instead of your boring old self. Put a skull in her lap, and she’ll forget to shoo you away.”
“Maybe,” Seb said hesitantly.
“Help me carry the bones to Elrahet, and I’ll give you twenty spines.”
The furrow in Seb’s brow softened. “Twenty?”
Gugi nodded. “Twenty.”
Twenty was a lot of spines. A couple weeks worth. There was no telling when they’d be back in the putty hills and she could pick another fill.
“How about it?” Gugi asked.
“Alright.”
Seb bent down to gather up the rest of the foot, but Gugi brushed her away, saying, “I’ll make it forty spines if you carry it all yourself.”
“You ain’t got forty spines.”
“I’ll give you twenty spines, and my God’s Eye burgeons.”
“Give me twenty spines, and you tell me where you get your God’s Eye burgeons.”
“No chance. It’s twenty and the burgeons, and you carry this bit all the way to Ayram. Or Elrahet. Or whoever.”
“I ain’t got a bag.”
“I do.”
Gugi pulled the strap of his slump-shouldered bag over his head, and emptied out a bunch of little nothings into the dirt.
Seb asked, “If you don’t think it’s cursed, then what you givin’ up your burgeons’ for? Carry it yourself.”
“I don’t wanna carry it.”
Seb’s brow tightened up again. “Why not?”
Gugi smiled. “Because it’s cursed.”
This was why no one liked Gugi—he was never upfront about the way things were. He’d betray anyone he could, if anyone ever thought to trust him. Seb was near to slapping him. “You thought you could get me to take up this cursed body for a measly twenty spines and some God’s Eye burgeons?”
“Am I wrong?”
Gugi’s face twisted into that annoying, presumptuous grin. Seb wanted nothing more than to break some of Ayram’s rules on that grin, but she thought better of it. Best thing to do was to take the grand scheme of things into account.
There were cursed bones under a bush, where no cursed bones should be. 
Maybe she was looking at this all wrong.
Maybe them bones wasn’t cursed.
Solraheen’s hand is there in the pain, and it’s there in the pleasure. A curse could be a blessing, and a blessing could be a curse. There’s no way of knowing which is which until it all plays out. It’s expectations that get in the way of seeing the divine plan. If she looked at all this with no expectations, and abstracted out the deadness of the bones from the strangeness of the circumstances, then no doubt she would take Gugi’s deal. God’s Eye burgeons for a little bit of toil? 
The best thing to do was to take the deal.
She said to Gugi, “You ain’t wrong, but dammit, you know I’m gonna kill you someday.” 
“Sure thing, Seb.”
“Before we do anythin’, you’re gonna gimme them burgeons.”
“I’ll give you the spines now, and the burgeons later.”
“Burgeons now, spines later.”
Gugi sighed, then pulled out a leather pouch from his robe and tossed it to Seb. Seb caught it, checked it, pocketed it, and then she crouched down, reached under the karkle’s twigs, and started swiping the bones up into the bag. The bigger bones she had to handle fresh on the skin of her palms, which was disconcerting, but it was over before she knew it. She didn’t stick around for Gugi’s mocking laugh. She took her haul back west, towards the Junei pass, towards the cliff where Ayram and Elrahet were planning out the ambush that would hopefully end all their ambushes for good. She didn’t know why they needed to know about these bones, but she knew they needed to know. They needed to know because she felt like they needed to know.
Even if they didn’t need to know, she was going to do what she wanted to do, and that was how things were.</Text>

            <Text>Mandri’s sleep-crusted eyelids split open and discovered that he was, somehow, back in little temple’s ladder room. It was dark. He lay quietly, lamenting his reinsertion into life’s causal flow of events.
The God’s Eye burgeon had been that good.
He didn’t remember any of the trip, but he remembered it was good.
When his eyes adjusted to the dimness, he discovered that he had, somehow, been brought back up to the temple’s ladder room. It was empty, save for him. The tumble of burned-out twigs were there, and the Ayramun’s packs were still there, so he hadn’t been left behind. He decided to climb the ladder and see if anyone was lounging around outside. He hoped someone was preparing a meal. The passing of the God’s Eye burgeon had left him hungry.
He climbed up the ladder’s rungs and as he moved the soreness in his body quickly worked itself out.
That must have been the work of the God’s Eye burgeon, too.
He decided to ask Seb about it as soon as he got the chance, but that would be all he would ask—he would pretend to remember everything that had happened down in that cave, including walking up into the little temple proper, because he didn’t want to give Seb the impression that he couldn’t handle a single sliver of that beautiful burgeon.
Mandri pulled himself up onto the cobbled black stone of the tiny desert temple floor. He kept calling it a temple, but there was no altar or kneeling stone—only that hole in the ground and the wooden ladder. There was a scrawl of Old Jandri script circumscribing the inner dome, but Mandri couldn’t read it. He guessed it told of the life of some dead desert father who’d died here and was buried in a crypt somewhere down below.
He stepped out into the cool evening air. With the heat of the day behind them, he assumed they would be moving again.
All of the Ayramun were gathered at the top of the nearest hill to his right. They stood with backs turned, facing west, facing the setting sun. They were a remarkable set of outland pokes of all different sizes, and with Obo included, still strapped in his litter and leaning against Ayram’s leg, they ranged from legless to the largest. Only Seb, at the end of the line, turned and regarded Mandri’s presence. This she did with a smirk and a wink, and Mandri felt compelled to return the courtesy. 
Mandri scrambled up the hill to join her, and as soon as he arrived at the top of that dune hill, all schemes of stealing Seb’s God’s Eye burgeons fled from thought, for it was not the setting sun which stretched out above the distant horizon, but a heavy cloud as dark as the oncoming night. And it was more than a cloud, it was the Lord of clouds for it stretched out across the world and churned it over. It could have been mistaken for a rampaging herd of mountains, if such a thing were possible. Mandri was struck by its color, for its upper reaches pierced the shadow of the world's edge to catch the fleeing light of day—at the top, a rim-lit tip of gold, blurring into pink, oozing into red, while the cloud’s body was a dusty wall of reddish-black stretching all the way down to the desert floor.
The storm’s magnificence was helped along by little westwind zephyrs tickling Mandri’s skin. So far as he could tell, this behemoth was lumbering straight towards them. It took his breath away.
Seb was standing next to Mandri, arms crossed, and for once she wasn’t chewing a spine—it hung there on her lip, forgotten.
“Big ‘ol bastard, ain’t it?”
This storm was much bigger than that. It was an Ugmukheen, a child of Mukh, inheritor of His wrath. To Mandri’s knowledge, the Sand hadn’t seen a storm anywhere near that size for at least three hundred years, back when Mukh was still alive.
Obo was as taken by the sight of the storm as everyone else.
“It is unnatural,” he said with something like wonder. This was the most honest emotion Mandri had heard Obo utter.
“Of course it’s natural,” Seb said. “Everything that happens is natural.”
“It comes from an impossible direction,” said Obo.
Moto peaked around Ayram’s figure so that he could sneer at the Mazid. “What would you know about the Ugmukheen?”
Obo countered by saying, “I’ve read every book and scroll that accounts the weather in this part of the world, and every Ugmukheen for the past thousand years was born abreast the Gongee Sea.”
“So?”
“When the high Gongee winds stop blowing, it’s like taking the lid off a pot of steaming water. That’s how such storms are made. And the Gongee Sea is four days to the south, not to the west. That’s not to mention that an Ugmukheen does not look like that.”
“Clearly,” said Moto, jealous of Obo’s learning, “They do look like that.”
Obo asked, “Have you ever seen an Ugmukheen before?”
“No. Have you?”
“I’ve read reports from those who have.”
Moto snorted, shook his head, and looked for support from the rest of the Ayramun, but everyone was transfixed by the storm.
“The Mazid speaks truth,” said Ayram. “A real Ugmukheen isn’t a wall of sand, it’s a mist. The first you know of it is when your own dust breathes down your neck. You might survive an Ugmukheen, but you can’t survive a thing like that.” He jabbed his iron spear towards the distant tempest and added, “A storm like that would flay my hide. That’s no Ugmukheen.”
Brooding Elrahet pulled her shawl tight and said, “Every god who could have brought such a storm upon the world is long dead.”
Seb said, “We can’t walk with that beast runnin’ us down.”
Elrahet nodded. “We stay in the hole. And we pray to all that is holy that these hills don’t swallow us before the Amalgamete gets its chance.”
Seb said, “There’s got to be another way.”
“We could try south,” said Moteah. “The Kari plain. Get out of its way.”
Ayram shook his head and stroked his beard. “Won’t have time. We stay in the hole until it passes.”
“What about the Hrks?” Moto cautioned. “If we don’t keep moving, they’ll catch us long before we reach Bullr.”
“Could try the Goree Pass,” said Seb.
“The Goree Pass…” Ayram repeated as his fingers twirled his beard.
“The Pass will never work,” said Moto.
“Says you,” said Seb as she mocked Moto’s characteristic snort.
Moto clicked his tongue. “The Goree Pass is cursed,” he declared, meeting Seb’s taunting gaze. “It’s as cursed as that damned storm.”
“Not cursed enough for the Greskal and the Greskalun.”
“It don’t matter who lives there. Sol’s light, it don’t matter if it’s cursed! The Pass is straight south of a Hrkan garrison. There’ll be Mazidariga sniffing all through it long before we get there.” 
Judging by the silence that followed, this was a good point. Seb didn’t like it. Mandri could hear her thinking because she’d started chewing her spine again, and she was munching hard, as if her thoughts were a water wheel spinning her jaw into action.
She said, “If the storm cuts north after blowin’ over, it’ll stop the Hrks from goin’ south. We could head for the Goree Pass to the south without a care.”
“What if it doesn’t curve north?”
Seb huffed. She had no answer to that, and she almost seemed angry about it. But in the end, her argument was saved by Ayram.
“I like the Goree Pass,” he said. “The Greskalun could keep the Hrks off our tail for a time. Greskal man hates Hrk as much as anyone.”
Every time Ayram pulled at his beard and twirled out a tuft of hair, the hair sprang right back into that smooth, bread-loaf shape. The hair on Ayram’s head gave his face a fuzzy aspect, probably because all of his features were over sized while the individual hairs were as small as anyone else’s, and they were as dense as felt.
“We’ll make for the Goree Pass,” Ayram finally declared. “We wait out the storm here in the hole, then skip the bones, and we head straight for the Goree.”
With that, he picked up Obo’s litter, then turned and side-step shuffled back down the hill. Moto stamped after him, fretting about this change of plans. Of the rest of the Ayramun, Moteah seemed the most unaffected. She was standing on a black rock which put her up a foot higher than the rest. She had a long reedy stick which she’d brought with her from the western plain below, and with it she drew little abstract faces, and then she’d watch the wind brush them away grain by grain.
Seb was watching the storm looking pleased with herself.
“Well,” Mandri said suggestively, “We suddenly find ourselves in possession of some recreational time.”
Seb patted her pocket, and what-do-you-know, she nodded and wandered back down the hill.
Mandri couldn’t follow too quickly as he’d arouse too much suspicion. Elrahet would probably ask why he wanted to waste the day with Seb. He counted to ten, then said, “Well, I’ll just, uh…I’ll go find something to eat.”
He scrambled down the hill to find Seb and burgeons.
Unfortunately, Moto found him first. The man was climbing up the temple ladder just as Mandri was about to climb down.
“Where are you going?” he asked as he climbed up onto the temple tile.
“To find a snack.”
“No free food until you show me you can earn your keep.”
In his hand was a Hrkan short sword stuck in a tawny scabbard that had been salvaged from the battle of Minting Rock. Moto extended this out towards Mandri, hilt first, clearly expecting Mandri to take it.
“I can’t imagine what you’d want me to do with this,” Mandri said. “Need me to chop a lizard for you?”
Moto was not amused. “Do you remember our conversation?”
“Nope,” said Mandri, biting his tongue.
“I remember it,” Moto said. “I was teaching you what men are made for—solving problems. I think it ended with you getting a bite on your leg.” Moto’s head tilted as if he were interrogating Mandri’s Spark. “I was going easy on you then. Now that you’re out here with us, I’ll be difficult. Take the damned sword.”
Mandri hesitated, but the man was serious, so he grabbed the sword and followed Moto back outside. The burgeons would have to wait.
Obo was outside as well, propped against the temple’s wall. Moto stopped in front of him and said, “You could learn something and pass it on to your Hrkan Lords. Their Skulsi are shitty fighters.”
“Yes, I heard how you and Ayram cut them down.”
“They’re brave,” Moto said as he moved on. “I’ll give them that.”
“Too brave,” said Obo.
“You’d rather they be cowards?”
Obo looked so strange, swaddled up like he was, the size of an overgrown baby but with the face of an ageless eunuch. Stranger still to see him adopt the air of a lecturer and say, “In the Hrkan art of war, there is no such thing as cowardice. There’s no such thing as bravery, either, for bravery and cowardice are both symptoms of a disease called unpreparedness. In war there is only preparedness, and unpreparedness. If a soldier is ever called on to be brave or a coward, then his commander has failed him.”
“Of all the shadows from Shis,” Moto muttered. “What are you talking about?”
Obo continued on, as if reciting some long-remembered scripture, “ Either the fighting man is fully prepared for what he faces and is victorious, or his commander has failed. Such a commander must kill himself.”
Moto strode several paces away, then drew his gold-hilted sword with a flourish. “You can be as prepared as you can possibly be for a fight, but still face bad odds.” He flicked the air with his blade. “That’s what calls for bravery.”
Obo lectured on. “If a commander’s soldiers face unbalanced odds, then the commander has failed in his maneuvers and his men have arrived to battle under prepared. Such a commander should kill himself.” He lowered his aloof airs and added, “These are not my words, they are Lord Kashkan’s.”
Moto swish-flicked his sword through the air in front of Mandri’s belly, as if slicing through Lord Kashkan’s guidance. “Lesson number one,” he said, addressing Mandri. “Don’t ever listen to a Hrk.”
“I already don’t,” Mandri replied.
“Lesson number two—always run away from a fight if you can.”
Mandri dropped his sword in the dirt. 
“He’s a prodigy,” Obo declared. 
“Very cute,” said Moto, eyes narrowing in irritation.  “Pick up your sword.”
“You know,” said Mandri, “The hand you people stole from me was my dominant hand.”
“It doesn’t matter.”
Moto switched his sword to his left hand and showed off his skill with another dexterous swish-flick and slice. The man was quite adept at slaying air.
“Shouldn’t I focus on being a Minder?”
“That’s what I’m helping you to do,” Moto said. “You can’t Mind the Mazid because you can’t Mind yourself. The fighting life cures a man of that dullness. And when you’re sharp, strong, you’ll get a taste of what it’s like to move a man against his will. It is the greatest feeling in all the world. From there, moving a Mazid should be no different.”
“Alright, I’ll play.
 Mandri said this to have it over with, because he didn’t think he could out-stubborn a man like Moto .
“Pick up your sword,” Moto commanded.
Mandri picked it up. Its heft felt awkward in his left hand. Its blade was dark like Ayram’s spear, though its single-edged blade was bright like silver, two-hands long, and it was thick, heavy, more like a cleaver than a sword.
“Now,” said Moto. “If you’re in a fight, what are you trying to do?”
“Survive?”
“Be more specific.”
“Run away.”
Moto sighed. “In the event where you must fight, what should you try to do? Be specific.”
“How can I be specific when I don’t know who I’m fighting?”
Moto’s eager shoulders grew more sullen with each exchange. He sighed again and said, “You are fighting a Skulsi.”
“Well then I’ll stab him before he stabs me.”
“Be more specific.”
“I’ll stab him in the uglies?”
“Mandri…you said you were a painter, yes? When you paint a portrait, what is the first thing you are trying to do?”
“I can’t see how that has anything to do with killing.”
Moto jaw went tight and he grunted, like a pouting child.
Mandri continued on, saying, “There’s nothing artful about killing. And I’ve seen enough killing to know.” His declaration roughened up Moto’s dark face.
“Did I speak of killing?” Moto asked. His question dripped with derision. “I spoke of combat. A fight is a work of art. All artists try to get at the human heart, a man with a sword simply takes the most direct approach. The only difference between a fight and a painting is that the best painter is a matter of opinion, but the best fighter—that is a matter of fact. And before you embarrass yourself with endless denial, think of how you don’t judge the entire art of painting from one child’s scribblings. If you were to see the best fighters in action, you would agree with me.”
“And who is the best? You?”
“I might be.”
“Who would win in a fight, you or Ayram?”
The answer was obvious, but Moto didn’t answer quickly. He snorted disbelief, then rubbed his head in frustration, as if the question was one of those utterances that made semantic sense but signified nothing, a stumbling block for would-be philosophers.
“That question depends on too many things,” he said. “That question lacks context. It isn’t a real question.”
“The context is you versus Ayram.”
Moto’s face went through such an extended series of contortions that he could have charged money to see the act. Somewhere in there was the suggestion that it was offensive to even ask the question. He went through a few different shades of disappointment as well, and it was obvious he was upset with himself for letting things stray too far from the lesson at hand, and upset at Mandri for simply existing. In the end, his face settled into plain old vexation, and he blurted out, “We’re done. If you don’t want help, you won’t get it. Stay weak. You’ll die and we’ll find another Minder.”
Moto stomped past and fled into the temple. Before his head disappeared down the ladder, he paused and said bitterly, “Keep the sword.”
When he was gone, Mandri shared an impish smile with Obo. 
Obo said, “We should probably head down as well, don’t you think?”
“Why?”
“Look at the sky behind you.”
Mandri looked behind and saw the brilliant reds and purples of the approaching storm.
“Oh, right. Almost forgot.”
Mandri sheathed his sword and tucked it into the waist of his robe. He then hauled Obo, still in his litter, into the tiny temple and down the ladder. Once down, he propped Obo up against the wall and wandered off to find Seb, but the idiot had gone to sleep. Instead of enjoying a mind-splitting burgeon, Mandri sat against the wall and waited in boredom with the rest of the Ayramun. It did not take long for the storm to break over them.
First came the shadow as the storm blocked out the setting sun, leaving the air outside suffused with a dim orange glow. Then came the soothing sound of wind-whipped sand splashing against the temple’s bricks above. Every now and then a gust of wind would blow into the temple entrance and swirl around inside, and if the wind was strong enough, it blew through the hole in the floor, turning the ladder room and the tunnel beyond into a sort of flute—the faint whimpering whine sounded startlingly similar to the birthing fits of the brown mutts back in Meskalim.
As the wind intensified, this whine steadied into a droll hum, a sound so annoying that all the Ayramun retreated deeper into the tunnel behind the ladder. Only Mandrameen and Obo stayed in the ladder room. Obo was there because no one could be bothered to pick him up and move him. Mandri stayed because he was mesmerized by the sight and sound of the storm outside. Being near to a monstrous, blossoming power was intoxicating.
“I wonder what caused it?” Mandri wondered as the blackness settled in. The room had no fire, and that was fine, because the energy from the storm outside was somehow a comfort. It made Mandri feel squeezed in, bottled up.
“You think it was sent by the Amalgamete? Does it have this kind of power?”
“I cannot say,” said Obo.
“Maybe it was Solraheen.”
“Solraheen didn’t make this storm. As I’m sure you are aware, He no longer exists amongst the living.”
“He might not have made this particular storm, but He made…you know…He made the structure for it. He made the world that made it. Maybe He even made the Amalgamete.”
“How profound,” Obo said sarcastically.
“It must be Solraheen, even if it wasn’t Him.”
“Do you hear yourself when you speak? Mandri, you make no sense.”
“What I mean is, whatever caused it, there’s a chain that goes back to Solraheen, because He’s the only true creator. Everyone else can only move things around, but that’s not true creation. Solraheen created everything, set it in motion, so it all goes back to Him.”
“Even the Amalgamete?”
“Even the Amalgamete.” 
Mandri was feeling philosophical. All that was missing was some burgeon beer to complete the cozy mood. A nice freeweed wrap would do as well, but he didn’t usually go in for those. The heat of the storm worked a warmness into his skin, and the dimness, coupled with the storm’s humbling immensity, was working wonders on his stress. Satisfying, too, was the knowledge that he didn’t have to do damned thing, at least not for a good long while.
He asked Obo, “Do you have any beliefs? Does a Mazid believe anything?”
“What do you mean?”
“Forget I asked. I’m just happy you’re here with me.”
“I’m touched,” said Obo. Obo’s pale face was the only thing Mandri could really see in this darkness. As the rest of Obo’s body was swaddled in black, his face hovered like a ghost above the ground. He looked delighted.
“I’m happy too,” he said. “Without you I’d be alone amongst these Ayramun, and that would be horrific.”
“Have you given any more thought to our escape?”
“I’ve given up.”
“Why?”
“Where would I go? Back to Hrk? Never. These people, rough as they are, they’re my only chance at freedom. It’s a slim chance that Elrahet gives me a Spark, but she’s the only person in all the world who could.”
The two of them sat in contemplative silence for half a hand. Mandri mulled over Obo’s miserable life. Obo was a creature created to be a slave, a weapon. All he’d known was cruelty and killing. It was a rough deal, like a dog born and bred for the pit.
Mandri felt a swell of goodwill rise up in himself. He wondered if this was some lingering effect of the God’s Eye burgeon. If it was, it didn’t matter, because it was there and there was no ignoring it.
“You know what, Obo? You deserve a Spark more than I do. I’d give you mine if I could.”
“Thank you for saying that.”
“No, I mean it. Maybe I can get you a Spark.”
“How?”
“If Moteah’s right, then they need your Mazidfire. If you’ve got no Minder, then they’ve got no other way to kill the Amalgamete, other than to give you a Spark.”
Obo smiled politely. “Don’t worry about me. I don’t think that’s a productive use of your time.”
“Well, what else am I going to do? Worry about me? My fate is sealed. You said yourself that I don’t have the right stuff to be a Minder. And you’re right, I’m never going to force you to do something you don’t want to do. I’m not a slaver. They’re going to kill me as soon as they figure that out.”
“If someone must be my Minder, I would prefer it would be you.”
“What I truly don’t understand is why they chose me for the job.”
“It is strange, isn’t it? If you could summon my Mazidfire, that would make you more powerful than them. You could do whatever you wanted to them.”
“Then why would they trust me with the power to control you?”
“All threads draw back to a black tattered robe.”
“Elrahet?”
“Indeed. The mystery of you is circumscribed by the mystery of Elrahet. I watched her as we walked—she is no ordinary witch, too strong for her age. In all matters of Mazid and Minder, Ayram defers to her.”
“You know, she’s not the only witch I’ve seen.”
“She isn’t?” Obo asked. His silver eyes widened in curiosity.
Mandri leaned towards Obo, and he lowered his voice so that it would not carry. The whipping wind outside did well to hide his whispered words.
“Before I was killed, I was visited by a witch just like Elrahet, only taller. And you know that golden knife Elrahet has?”
Obo nodded.
“Well, that witch had one just like it. Exactly the same. They could be sisters. Except this witch wanted me to serve the Amalgamete, not kill it. And there was no question about her being evil. She ripped out my ox’s stomach, then swallowed its Spark.”
Obo’s eyes turned to the floor as he worked to fit this new information into a picture which made sense. Mandri was content to let Obo do the puzzling for them both. Eventually, Obo’s floating head broke into a big, stupid smile.
“What is it?” Mandri whispered with excitement.
“Is this what friendship feels like?”
Mandri drew back and soured. “You don’t say something like that out loud. You just feel it. Dwell in it.”
“I’m sorry, I haven’t done this before.”
“I can tell.”
“It’s somehow intoxicating.”
“Stop talking about it. When you talk about it, you make it boring.”
“It’s not boring to me.”
“Look, when people start talking about their emotions and stuff, I have this physical reaction to it, and it’s annoying, so stop.”
“What kind of physical reaction?”
“My legs get hot.”
“Your legs get hot?”
“That’s what I said. Now shut up about it and figure out what is going on.”
Mandri stood up and fashioned some pillows out of what packs had been left in the room. He gave a quick look for Seb’s pack, because a drop of God’s Eye would significantly improve the moment, but Seb had expected this and had taken her pack with her. Mandri was forced, against his will, to lay there sober and watch the hole in the ceiling as the storm’s rage continued to build.
Hand after hand passed like this, and all the while the winds outside were rising. His thoughts turned to children’s stories, the ones that warned about the Ugmukheen. These stories came with instructions—hide the women, for as it passes it may fill their wombs. Beware the cough that can kill as vast quantities of sand are unavoidably inhaled. Store water, for it will strip the air of moisture, and its heat will sear the lungs. Mandri felt all these things coming on, except of course, the pregnancy part. But one thing he hadn’t seen was the snap and crackle of lightning leaping from every surface. The stories were clear on that—the air should come alive with little lightnings. 
The heat soon increased until the air was as hot as an oven. Mandri moved to flap his arms to air out his sweaty pits, and the motion conjured up a shocking spark.
He yelped in surprise.
“Your hair looks ridiculous,” said Obo.
Mandri reached up in the dark, and half the hairs on his head were standing on end. His excitement at this electric thrill was tempered by the sound of rock sliding atop rock.
It was coming from the temple above.
“The wind is lifting the dome,” said Obo, with a hint of worry.
“Should we be in here?”
“I would say that we should be fine, but, you never know.”
Mandri repositioned his makeshift cot as far away from the hole as the room allowed, shocking himself several times in the process. Before he was finished, an especially loud howl of wind kicked a gout of sizzling sand into the temple above, and it was followed by a splitting shock of thunder.

CRACKABOOOM

All Mandri saw was a flash of white light and then, suddenly, blackness, for the temple above caved in on itself, and the circle in the ceiling disappeared.
Mandri  shuffled back and felt for the wall. He could hear a torrent of sand pouring down into the room, and soon he felt it licking at his toes. The fear of being buried alive stunned him, but the flood of sand stopped as the hole above was plugged by a glut of the temple’s bricks.
“Well...that’s not good,” he said as one last wisp of sand drifted down—the sad, dying breath of another Old Jandri relic. </Text>

            <Text>Moteah offered Mandri a snack of binks. A bink was a yellow nut the size of a tooth, with black spots on either end. They were quite bitter. Mandri preferred the bland Hrkan hardtack.
Moteah said that binks were better for him than hardtack because they had healing properties. She said that there were mice living in the Sand that, if he could believe it, subsisted entirely on binks—no water. The binks get them through the severest droughts. She once had a pet mouse and was careful to never let it drink, as a sort of experiment. It lived on a diet of binks until the mousey old age of two.
Mandri doubted the story, but he did not say so out loud. He knew disagreement chases people away, and while that never would have stopped him in the past, he wanted Moteah to keep talking.
There was no amorous interest here. The desert was simply too big for him to get through it without hearing someone else talk. Obo was fun, but too much of one person was unhealthy.</Text>

            <Title>Sight Spot</Title>
            <Text>Finding Elrahet was easy because that witch never moved far from where she sat down, and that morning Seb had seen her sit down at the ambush sight spot. Getting up to her, however, was difficult. Seb could either climb up the steep cliff face, or she could take the long way around. Since she had to carry the bones she took the long way. She found the Junei road and walked it up into the mouth of the Junei pass. Instead of following that road through the mountains and all the way south to Meskalim, she scrambled off onto a smuggler’s trail which snaked up towards the mountain peaks. Before long, she hopped off that trail to follow a path which Ayram had made, one which double-backed towards the east.
It was nearing mid-day when Seb made it to the that wide, mid-cliff ledge where Elrahet was sitting. As far as ambush sight spots go, it was perfect—it offered a privileged view of everything east of the Hias mountains. Below was the mouth of the Junei Pass, out of which the Junei road poured. This unkempt road meandered down into the dark Junei hills, where it was dissected into a filigree of footpaths that wiggled down into valleys and bent around black screes and outcrops of solid rock before shooting through the ravines and bowing along the bottoms of wide, long-dried washes before emptying out, at last, into the Junei plain. Once out on the plain, all roads got lost because there the white ground is a rocky caliche that gets swept clean by the strong northerly Junsi wind.
Elrahet was alone up on that high ledge. To Seb’s blurry eyes, she was nothing but a bundle of black rags and long smoky hair flowing out the front of an old crone’s hood. She was sitting cross-legged and looked like she was communing with the vastness of the world, but really, she was sitting, watching, and waiting for their prey to rumble along.
“Took you long enough,” the witch mumbled as Seb approached.
Seb didn’t wait to catch her own breath before saying, “Gugi found some bones and—”
“I know.” 
Seb wondered how the witch knew, because the old woman hadn’t yet turned her head to see what Seb was carrying. But of course, this was, after all, the sight spot, and it had a good angle on every ravine, and on top of that, Elrahet was a witch. Who knows how far her witchy eyes could see.
“Bring them here,” Elrahet said.
Seb knew witches were cantankerous creatures, but Elrahet was especially cantankerous. Seb wondered about her age, though numbered age was rarely a thing people of the Sand tracked. A sand dune has no age, and outland witches like Elrahet were just as elemental. Her features were as dark, sharp, and solemn as any slab of sand-bitten stone. Her sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the wrinkly bark of any pepperwood tree. Her layers and layers of black-rag robe pillowed her knobbly frame and made her look a bit like a diseased crow. Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the Hias mountains themselves, and probably as old.
“Should I command your every twitch?” Elrahet snipped. “Put the bag down.”
Seb set the bag of bones down gently, not wanting to annoy the woman. She didn’t want to be shooed away before she’d heard any new witchy words. It was her great mission in life to listen when Elrahet spoke. This was a difficult mission, because not only did Elrahet harbor disdain for folks in general, she hated Seb more than most. And why shouldn’t she? As a witch above witches, Elrahet could see the plan. She knew what Seb was. And to make Seb’s quest more difficult, when Elrahet did speak, she spoke softly, hoarsely. Her throat croaked like a dying man. All her sentiments were brusque and rude. All her sentences were death sentences. 
Then there was her bloodspeech. That’s what Seb called Elrahet’s absent-minded mumbling. She called it bloodspeech because whenever the old crone spoke it, Seb’s own blood tingled, and as soon as the bag of bones was opened that bloodspeech was flowing. Elrahet reached in, bone by bone, gave it a once over, then tossed it over the cliff. Eventually she stopped, looked up at Seb and through her irascible sneer she growled,“Busy yourself.”
Seb stepped back and privately cursed herself for not handling the situation with more tact. She should have expected less. Elrahet was impossible to please. In the first few months of Seb’s journey with the Ayramun, she’d tried winning the witch over with kindness—she’d make her meals, wash her blankets, carry her things, and for all that, Elrahet called her a ‘servile goat’. If Seb ignored the woman entirely, that only enraged her. If Seb did what she wanted, exactly how she wanted it, no more or no less, then she was a ‘mindless poke’. It had been three whole years and as many months, and Seb had learned almost nothing about Elrahet’s peculiar brand of witchery.
The only bit of wisdom she’d ever heard her speak was a rather childish aphorism given to young Papi. Papi had been pouting about some useless thing and Elrahet said to him, “Every weakness is a strength, and every strength, a weakness.” If anyone else had said something as stupid as that, Seb would have disregarded it. Strength is strength. Weakness is weakness. Seb’s eyes were a weakness. If a thing was up close she could keep it sharp, but ‘way far out’ and ‘not too far off’ were smashed together into a blurry haze he called ‘out there somewhere’. She looked out on the Junei plain from that high ledge, and all she saw was a wash of white ground underneath a blur of blue sky.
The only good thing that came of her unreliable eyes was that she never had to stand watch, and while she took special pleasure in not being saddled with that chore, calling that a strength was merely twisting words. When a woman is strong she doesn’t need to twist words. For a witch steeped in the mysteries of the Spark to say a thing like that, to say ‘weakness is a strength’, then there had to be some deeper purpose underneath the surface. Elrahet only ever spoke to bend the world to her will. Her words might have been for Papi, but Seb had overheard it, and her overhearing it was no doubt as much a part of Elrahet’s intentions as if she’d heard the words directly. Elrahet was sending her down a path. Seb was sure of it.
Seb stared out at the Junei plain and tried to find the coming caravan by its aura. She knew the caravan was out there somewhere in that blur, making its way towards the pass to be set upon by the Ayramun. She let her eyes cross just enough so that the white landscape doubled and blurred until the edge between the white chaliche and the blue of the midday sky softened into a clean gradient. She strained under the effort, until, at last, there was nothing else in the world but her, that cloud of color, and the distant caravan—if indeed it was even there. She supposed it was there, and she hoped to see its aura flare. Maybe it takes bad eyes to see the divine light of purpose that shines out of every living being. Maybe that’s how her weakness was a strength.
She stared into that blur and bore the look of a woman possessed—jaw clenched tight, breathing in sips, skin tingling, stomach tense. She could feel the energy screaming out of her eyes, she was scouring all the world with it. She trembled as the gods trembled. Sweat beaded on her brow. 
Then she caught a faint whiff of a curious odor. A foul odor. Was it Elrahet’s? Was it her own?
She took another sniff and was hit with a familiar musk—it was hers.
And there were some nesting brightbeaks, up on the cliff behind. Seb knew this without looking because when brightbeaks jump out of their holes they flap their little wings so hard that they beat a pathetic, warbling whistle out of their tiny chests. One flew right by her ear.
But that brightbeak wasn’t the most distracting thing. That honor went to the way in which the borcandi juice oozed out of the spine tucked in her cheek and welled up in her mouth. Borcandi juice doesn’t play nice with the stomach, so people spit it out. But spitting would break her concentration. Then again, her concentration was already broken, so she spat—she spat out  the whole damn wad. It was as big as her tongue.
“Dammit, Seb! You’re a servant of Shis, I swear it!”
Elrahet’s accusation sent Seb into a flustered panic. A long thin track of green-gray spit lacing across the bag of bones. Thankfully, none of it had touched Elrahet.
“Aw, shit! Sorry! Shit. Didn’t mean to.”
She crouched down and tried to atone for her absent-mindedness by wiping the bag clean with her dirty sleeve.
“Get away afore I have you tossed off the cliff!”
“Didn’t mean it.”
Elrahet picked up her short, gnarled root of a walking cane and swung it at Seb’s head. Seb pulled back in time to watch it brush her nose.
Elrahet glowered and said, “I’m that close to cursing your flesh so it steams your bones.”
“I didn’t mean it. Here, let me—”
Elrahet swung again, and her backswing was faster, so fast that the cane head smacked Seb’s cheek. If the old woman had been serious, it might have broken Seb’s face.
Seb clutched her bruised cheek and stumbled back, thankful it was only a warning, though Elrahet’s withering glare said her patience would not bear another word. 
Seb cursed herself again as she trudged away. This was another of her many weaknesses—she was forgetful. She couldn’t hold onto a moment if she were alone in a pitch-black cave. People said this was because of all the spines she chewed, but Seb knew that wasn’t true because she’d always been like this. And she’d never once been in a position where her fitful mind was a strength. Gugi had said that if her mind was always jumping around then at least that means she can’t be sad for too long, and so she should be happy about that, but somehow that wasn’t true—being sad was the one thing Seb could be for too long.
She leaned over the cliff face and spat a fat loogie down. She watched it fall with some delight, though she was denied the pleasure of seeing it splat on the rocks below because the ground was far enough away to be ‘out there somewhere’.
That’s when Moto came scrambling down to the sight spot from some hidden perch up above.
Seb disliked Moto. Moto, a black man from Zos, was stronger, younger, and more skilled than Seb in every way imaginable. He was too well put together to be an Ayramun. Everyone else made do with dark, patchwork robes and nail-strapped soles for shoes, whereas Moto had silver metal buckles on his dusty black boots, and he wore an orange robe that was tucked and folded into sharp knife pleats that slanted across his chest and were kept secured by a wide and tight black sash around the belly. Moto was so clean and fastidious that he would have been at home in the upper echelon of Hrkan society. He even had a sword, a long, curved sword set inside a gold-studded scabbard. It even had a name. Worse than all of this, he had healthy teeth. Few things made Seb more aware of her own disgusting self than being in the presence of healthy teeth. A woman is hard done up when a smile does nothing but make her jealous.
Moto surveyed the Junei plain and said to Seb, “You can’t see them, can you?”
The bastard knew she couldn’t see shit. That’s who Moto was—there was a bag of dead bones not ten feet away, an ill omen just discovered, yet here Moto was taking the time to take the spit right out of Seb’s cheek.
“Course I can’t see,” said Seb, and Moto chuckled. His was a damned hearty, healthy chuckle.
“Well they’re there,” he said. “They’re on their way. Exciting, isn’t it?” He then looked down at Elrahet, pretending to notice the bones for the first time. “And who is that?”
Loath to be interrupted, Elrahet grumbled out a barely-audible, “Nothing.”
“Nothing? What does that mean?”
“Means what it means.”
“I need to know. The Mazid will be here before long. Do these bones change things?”
Elrahet stood up, grabbed the bag, and tossed it over the edge of the cliff. As the bag fell, the bones came tumbling out, cracking against the cliff face.
Elrahet turned and glared at the two pokes. Her skin was so lined with age that even the subtlest action of her brow would send it cracking into sharp relief. At the moment there was only the faintest hint of her familiar sneer. Then she huffed and shuffled down the ridge path, leaving Seb and Moto to wonder at the meaning of her sudden leaving.
“I guess that means they don’t matter,” Moto mused. “And I guess that means it’s on.”
“You sure they’re out there?” Seb asked.
Moto nodded and pointed out towards the blur. “There’s a tiny black speck and a faint cloud of dust. That would be them. That would be our target.”
“You sure that’s them?”
“Who else could it be?”
“Could be anyone.”
Moto snorted in annoyance, which was a common enough occurrence that some of the Ayramun called him a ‘rutting bull’, though they were careful to never let Moto overhear.
“Elrahet predicted that a Mazid and his Minder would be making for the pass,” he said. “And that the two would be hiding themselves in a blackwood caravan. She said they’d be coming mid-day today.” Moto pointed out to the desert again, this time with two imploring hands. “There’s a caravan out there. It’s mid-day. It all fits. That’s who we’re hunting. Or do you doubt Elrahet?”
Seb spat another loogie off the cliff. “Did Elrahet say anythin’ about a dead body?”
“No,” Moto said defensively. “Are you saying something about a dead body?”
“I’m not sayin’ nothin’, I’m lookin’ at it scattered all over these hills.”
“I don’t see why it changes anything.”
“If there’s a curse floatin’ in them hills, then Ayram should know about it.”
“Who said anything about a curse?”
“What else is a bag of bones supposed to be?”
Moto snorted again. “Everything is a curse to you. A rock stuck in your shoe is a curse. A dead leaf is a foul omen. Unless Elrahet thinks there’s something more here, then it doesn’t change anything.”
“How’s it not change nothin’? How’s findin’ a dead body not put a notch in your bow?”
“Because I’m a man of resolve, Seb. I go until the goings no good.”
“You don’t even know for sure that there’s a Mazid out there in that desert. Could be only merchants and we come out here for nothin’.”
“If it’s only merchants, then we knock off a few fat bellies and we get a little richer. What’s the problem?”
“Could be that those aren’t merchants, but a bunch of Hrkan Skulsi in disguise.”
“A few soldiers won’t change the balance.”
“What if it’s more'n a few?”
“Then we’ll kill more than a few.”
“And how many is that?”
Moto sighed and pulled a small, red leather purse out from the belly of his robe. Seb’s eyes went wide at sight of it, for inside that pouch was a ribbon of black silk, and folded inside that silk were two smooth rock crystal lenses set inside thick brass rings. These rings were joined together by a dangling chain that, when stretched, was the length of Moto’s forearm. Seb always itched to try out those lenses, but Moto never let her touch them. Seb hated Moto for that. If those two lenses, set in array, could magnify the distance and make the horizon seeable, well, Seb wanted to have a look.
Moto sat down on the edge of the cliff and propped his elbow up on one knee and let his other leg dangle free. He hunched over, put the smaller lens up to his eye, then stretched out the other lens as far the chain would let, and began his squinting study of the distant blur.
Seb didn’t appreciate Moto sitting that way. It wasn’t just the lenses, it was the casual disregard for what Seb was capable of doing. In a flash, Seb could be right behind the man and push him off the cliff. Seb could end him right there. For all of Moto’s strength and skill with a sword, Seb could end him here. There were plenty of moments like this when Seb could do it. Could do it while Moto slept. While he ate. Seb had half a mind to do it right now.
Moto said, “I count fifty-four of them. Give or take.”
“Fifty-four’s more’n a few,” said Seb.
“And fifty-four is exactly how many Elrahet said there’d be—though there is an odd fix about them.”
“An odd fix?”
Moto squinted again. He was having trouble keeping his quarry in focus.
“It’s like they’re…well…they’re a standard caravan guard, but it looks like they’re marching in squares.”
Seb didn’t know much, but she knew one thing for certain—Moto’s expectations were getting in the way of the truth. And there was one other thing she knew for certain. “There ain’t no caravan guard that keeps in squares,” she said.
“That’s why I say it’s an odd fix.”
“It’s an odd fix ‘cause they ain’t no caravan guard. They’re real fighting men. Elrahet was wrong.”
“Eight wagons, too. That exactly matches her premonitions.” 
Seb screwed up her face in thought. Eight wagons was several more than the average merchant train. Predicted, maybe, but a merchant guard marching in tight formation? Caravan hands in this part of the Sand were ragged bands of backwash from Hrkan conquests, not the kind to march in squares.
Those men out there were Skulsi, Seb was sure. Fifty-four Skulsi and a god-damned Mazid were bearing down on them. And how many more men might be hiding in those wagons? Thirty?
Seb compared all this to what the Ayramun brought to bear—forty-three bows. Forty-three bows and Ayram. And old Elrahet. Against anyone else she liked the odds, but nobody tangled with the Mazidai with good reason—the fire those slaves hid in their stomachs could wipe out entire armies.
But the Junei hills were a decent place to bushwhack a column of Hrks. Everywhere the slopes were steep, and no matter which particular route was taken into the pass there were places where strong shoulders would have a clean shot at the whole enemy column—that’s assuming the whole column was dumb and tried to stuff through all at once. Skulsi weren’t dumb. Against fearful men, an ambush here would be a slaughter. Against experienced warriors, Seb was not so sure. Add a Mazid…well if the Mazid was caught unawares...maybe the odds were three to one against. And that’s assuming the Mazid got taken down early and without too much trouble. 
 “I’d take them for Skulsi,” Moto said, “But even from here you can see they’re wearing that stingy brown wool of blackwood guards.”
“Could be common hands,” Seb replied.
“It could be.”
“Also could be those are Hrkan troops.”
“But they’re wrapped in brown wool.”
“So? A man can change his clothes.”
“A Skulsi doesn’t drop his whites for convenience, not even for subterfuge. It’d be a black mark.”
“The Sand makes converts of us all.”
Moto let go of his lens and watched them dangle on their chain. “Pride,” Moto noted through a plaintive sigh, “Is the only thing a Skulsi has. Once a soldier earns the whites, he’s not going to take them off for anything.” He paused. A subtle frown played on his lips. “Still, even if they’re wearing brown, they could be fighting men.”
“So they could be rabble, and they could be Skulsi.” 
“Skulsi won’t run when the killing starts.”
Seb nodded, and added, “And the way we’re set up—”
“I know. This only works if they try to run. But this is a game of risk. In the end, this is a Mazid we’re trying to catch. The Skulsi hardly matter.” 
“Then it’s decided,” Seb said. “It’s off.”
“That’s not for you to call, Seb. Sol’s light knows you’d be the last person allowed to make that call.”
“You ain’t shit either.”
“That’s where you’re wrong. Ayram put me in charge.”
Moto stood back up to make sure Seb got the full measure of him. “And like it or not, this is the only opportunity we’ll have to catch us a Mazid and its Minder. Elrahet being wrong about who they’re marching with isn’t enough to call this off.”
“What about the bones?”
“What about them?”
“If this don’t work out, an’ Ayram finds out there’s a dead body you didn’t let him know about it, then I’m blamin’ you. It’ll be your fault—your fault.”
“Yes, that’s how responsibility works.”
Moto then pinched a flat stone finger whistle between his lips and whistled the song of the Jek Tresset to let the Ayramun hidden in the valleys below know that the ambush was on. He stabbed and fluttered the high notes to encourage haste. Twittered replies sprang up from the hills below, and then, without so much as a parting nod, Moto set off down the path that led into that maze of mounded clay and rock.
Seb had different ideas about what she needed to do. She was going to run off to Elrahet’s cave, for the old witch was soon to conjure a blanket of fog the likes of which the Junei hills hadn’t seen for an age—a nice impenetrable fog to lay cover for the ambush, and damn it all if Seb didn’t get to watch how she did it.
Elrahet, Seb had learned, was difficult to track on account of the woman’s witchy senses. She couldn’t be followed. Seb only knew where her cave was because she’d scouted for it the night before—it was a thin crack in the base of a giant sloping slab of granite that constituted the greater part of a mountain peak. It was a bit of a climb to get to it. How Elrahet managed it, Seb had no idea.
When she made it to the cave crack, she could hear Elrahet’s faint mumblings echoing out. She shuffled inside and saw the old witch squatting over the corpse of a sizable black-backed lizard, both of them illuminated by a shaft of bluish light which poured down from a hole in the ceiling.
The lizard was belly up, and Elrahet’s fingers were already knuckle deep in its guts. Her arm twisted and twirled, and her lips whispered incantations as her upturned eyes searched the blue sliver of midday sky that peeked through the crack in the rock above.
Then she turned and set her dark eyes on Seb.
Seb stumbled backwards in fright and bumped her head on a rock and howled in pain.
“Damn!”
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, then she set her eyes back on the sky, and put her hand to work again in the lizard’s corpse.
She lowered her voice to a whisper
Seb strained to hear her garbled words.
“Em bestet buguul.”
When the words were echoed and gone, Elrahet looked down at her handiwork and said, “Em bestet shemuul.” 
She pushed down hard with her palm to squeeze the last meal out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Shefre gor, amkukre dor.” 
Her knotted fingers kneaded the intestines. 
“Shefre gor, zomgagor.”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up into the air and croaked, “We would be dust without it!” 
She dropped the entrails back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within.
Seb waited with bated breath for a sight of a Spark, or some effervescent swirl of glowing smoke, or anything, but nothing happened.
Elrahet snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s white belly wider. Into this gaping hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, and with it she pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin. The lizard’s belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Its gummy tongue popped out of its shovel mouth, and right when Seb supposed that the thing had come back to life,  Elrahet pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh.
“It is possible,” she said in a whisper loud enough for Seb to hear, “that the beast is infertile.”
Seb ventured nearer.
“This won’t work?” she asked as he knelt across from the witch.
“Not with this beast.”
Seb poked the lizard’s corpse with a curious finger. She could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-gray intestines inside writhed and pulsed like a twisted mass of worms.
“What are you gonna do?” she asked.
Elrahet hissed at her impudence, then said, “I need a fertile stomach.”
She looked at Seb’s stomach.
“Fresh blood from a fertile stomach,” she said.
Seb’s skin went cold at the insinuation.
“You are right here, in my cave, during my time of need. Did Solraheen provide you to me without my seeking?”
“My blood’s no good.”
“Quit your bellyaching and give me your arm.”
“My arm?”
“Your arm.”
“Thought you were gonna cut my stomach. How much blood you need?”
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given, least of all for magic. There’s no telling what a witch might do with it. But this was a golden chance to get in with the witch, and Seb had to take it. She studied Elrahet’s countenance to gauge her sincerity. Even in direct light, the difference between Elrahet’s smile and her frown was almost imperceptible under her sneer. It was common belief amongst the Ayramun that Elrahet never smiled at all, but Seb knew that wasn’t true. She’d seen her smile. She knew what it looked like. Elrahet wasn’t smiling now. 
“Your arm,” Elrahet said.
Seb rolled up her sleeve and extended her arm. Elrahet grabbed her wrist and Seb nearly wretched because Elrahet’s fingers were still dripping with the lizard’s blood, and she also didn’t care for the way Elrahet seemed to relish the sight of her veins bulging under her brown skin. And she didn’t like the way Elrahet smiled as she felt Seb shudder in her grip. Yes, she smiled. It caught Seb off-guard, for it was more than a crick in the corner of the lip, it was a full-on, nearly toothless grin.
Seb asked again, with more than a hint of unease, “How much do you need?” 
Elrahet’s smile faded and that mess of aged lines settled back into her familiar sneer. She pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from out of the shadows beside her and laid them between herself and Seb. Then she unsheathed a thin, curved golden knife from some hidden compartment in her robes and held its curve length-wise along Seb’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said, without affection.
“Do it.” 
Elrahet savored the lack of courtesy, then pricked her dagger’s tip into Seb’s flesh and flicked her wrist with expert care to open the vein. Seb remained stoic through the sting but she watched with grave concern as blood streamed out of the wound and ran around her wrist and over Elrahet’s knuckles as it flowed steadily down into the bowl.
After what seemed an eternity, she jerked her arm free. 
“That’s it,” she said firmly, and she held her hand up and pinched the wound closed with her thumb.
“Your gift is humbling,” said Elrahet, “But the bowl is half-full.”
“That should be enough.”
“Is it?”
“A poor witch blames her tools.”
Elrahet scowled. “Who told you that?”
“You’re not the only witch I’ve known.”
Elrahet grumbled as if she were about to bark and bite. 
Seb backed away.
When next Elrahet spoke her voice was thick with contempt. 
“Think worse of where you sit on the scales of mercy. I could have your stomach for a bag.”
She tossed the scrap of linen at Seb’s face and shooed her out with a flick of her finger.
Seb cursed herself yet again, because not only did she spoil whatever goodwill she thought she’d earned, but she’d let Elrahet prick the wrong wrist, her pulling wrist. Every pull of the bowstring in the coming ambush would bring a twinge of pain. </Text>

            <Text>Ayram led them to southeast leading Charnel road called the Hatthir road. There were plenty of pilgrim skeletons on the Hatthir road. One of them, it turned out, was still alive. Ayram noticed the man first. He picked up the poor pilgrim and set him the shade of a makeshift tent. The dying pilgrim stared out at all the Ayramun with winkless eyes. His skin was like paper, and his ribs were countable through the window in his yellow haircloth habit, while his stomach lay almost flat against his vertebral column.
This pilgrim thought Ayram was Solraheen enfleshed. Ayram paused, sponged water onto the man’s lips, and they made a brief, whispered exchange which Mandri could not hear.
Mandri gave the pilgrim one of Tob’s rocks. It put a passing joy into the pilgrim’s eyes. Then the Ayramun moved on to let him die.</Text>

            <Title>Deep Well</Title>
            <Text>The next morning they stumbled upon a deep well in the middle of nowhere. None present had ever seen it before, though Elrahet claimed to have seen it, only she’d completely forgotten about it. It was huge, two-men wide, and included a full set of stairs zig-zagging down to the bottom some fifty yards deep. Moto lowered a bucket. The water it contained was salty and brackish, and there were fish in it. They were the ugliest little minnows Mandri had ever seen—blind fish with pulpy membranes where there should have been eyes. The Ayramun stopped and cooked the lot of them in a stew. It was not delicious. Afterwards, Seb began an argument with his own damned self.
He said, in between squelching chews, “If you take a barrel full of water and put a live fish in it, the water overflows, but if you put a dead fish in it, the water don’t overflow.”
He’d claimed this implied something or other about the Spark, but then he’d immediately discount it, and he went on like this for half a hand until Obo asked the man if he’d ever actually put a dead fish into a barrel of water. Seb said he hadn’t, so he filled a bowl with water, put a dead fish in it, and found that water overflowed.
He did not know what to make of this.</Text>

            <Text>Forget ‘works’ - its ‘doings of torah’. That brings a whole bunch of very bad protestant theology into the mix. This is about circumcision.

Galatians 5:19

6:2

The issue is not entrance requirements, but maintenance requirements.

The first argument from scripture. Including the application of the argument - 4:8-11. And the appeal to return to Paul.

Argument-application-appeal.

The spirit replaces torah.
The work of christ - the work of spirit -
A trinitarian statement of christian faith, without which you cannot have christian faith, because you have the work of the father, the son and the spirit. 

“I don’t think James is responsible for any of this.”

He thinks that’s saying more than we know if we say there was a conflict between paul and james.

I wish they would their own testicles cut off.

Deuteronomy 30:14
Romans 10:8

The defense of Paul.
Why would he change these things?
Someone who works in terms of boundaries is fundamentally incapable of understanding. 

There is the truth of the spiritual experience, the truth of the higher morality, but how can we hold it if we bearers give false witness?

            <Title>Paint Drgon</Title>
            <Text>There would be storage vats and mills: edge-runner mills to separate pigments from crude ores, ball mills to powder the pigments, pug mills to mix them with oil. There would be boiling vats and calciners — 15-foot-high furnaces used to produce caustic lime for sealant solutions.

 The valley floor was cultivated into fields of bananas and cane and melons, and where it was not cultivated there were stands of thistle palms and berry thickets and the occasional giant fig brooding sentinel over the rest.

 The land continued to slope upwards, but more gently than before. Gnarled, stunted oaks pushed up from thickets of chokecherry, and insects sizzled in the weeds. They might have been walking on a natural shelf several hundred feet across; but ahead of them, where the ground rose abruptly, a number of thick, greenish-black columns broke from the earth. Leathery folds hung between them, and these were encrusted with clumps of earth and brocaded with mould. They had the look of a collapsed palisade and the ghosted feel of ancient ruins.

 the dragon had seemed to Meric a simple thing, a big lizard with a tick of life left inside, the residue of a dim sensibility; but he was beginning to suspect that this tick of life was more complex than any he had encountered.

With the ponderous slowness of a theatre curtain opening, the halves slid apart to reveal the glowing humour. 

 What had looked to be vague glints, odd refractions of the sunset, he now realized were photic reactions of some sort. Fairy rings of light developed deep within the eye, expanded into spoked shapes, flooded the humour, and faded - only to be replaced by another and another. He felt the pressure of Griaule's vision, his ancient mind, pouring through him, and as if in response to this pressure, memories bubbled up in his thoughts. Particularly sharp ones. The way a bowlful of brush water had looked after freezing over during a winter's night - a delicate, fractured flower of murky yellow. An archipelago of orange peels that his girl had left strewn across the floor of the studio. Sketching atop Jokenam Hill one sunrise, the snowcapped roofs of Regensburg below pitched at all angles like broken paving stones, and silver shafts of the sun striking down through a leaden overcast. It was as if these things were being drawn forth for his inspection. Then they were washed away by what also seemed a memory, though at the same time it was wholly unfamiliar. Essentially, it was a landscape of light, and he was plunging through it, up and up. Prisms and lattices of iridescent fire bloomed around him, and everything was a roaring fall into brightness, and finally he was clear into its white furnace heart, his own heart swelling with the joy of his strength and dominion.

 torn banners and spoiled food littering the streets

 calciners and vats atop his head belched flame into the sky, 

populated by prostitutes, workers, gamblers, ne'er-do-wells of every sort, and soldiers: the burdensome cost of the project had encouraged the city fathers of Teocinte to form a regular militia, which regularly plundered the adjoining states and had posted occupation forces to some areas

Herds of frightened animals milled in the slaughtering pens, waiting to be rendered into oils and pigments.

 who was the soul of the practical man, without a visionary bone in my body - felt as though I were being whirled away into the painting, up through geometries of light, latticeworks of rainbow colour that built the way the edges of a cloud build, past orbs, spirals, wheels of flame…

 She was twelve years younger than he, tall and lovely, with sun-streaked hair and brown eyes that went dark and seemed to turn inward whenever she was pensive. 
She was in the habit of analysing everything that affected her, drawing back from her emotions and inspecting them as if they were a clutch of strange insects she had discovered crawling on her skirt.

Peels of dead skin hung down from the shadows like torn veils of ectoplasm; ferns sprouted from the vanes, which were thicker than cathedral columns; swallows curved through the black air. Sometimes, lying with her hidden by a tuck of the wing, Meric would think the beating of their hearts was what really animated the place, that the instant they left, the water ceased flowing and the swallows vanished. He had an unshakable faith in the transforming power of their affections, and one morning as they dressed, preparing to return to Hangtown, he asked her to leave with him.

Her fingers trailed over his shoulder - a gentle, treasuring touch. 

Acne-scarred, lean, arrogant, Major Hauk was a very young major with a limp. When Meric had entered, the major had been practising his signature; it was a thing of elegant loops and flourishes, obviously intended to have a place in posterity. 

&quot;A question of materiel&quot; said the major firmly. &quot;The price of antimony, for example…&quot;
&quot;Hardly use it any more,&quot; said Meric. &quot;I'm almost done with the mineral reds.&quot;

 It looked as if the sunlight were an extension of the gleaming resins, as if the thickness of the paint were becoming infinite. He let the major's voice recede to a buzz and followed the scatter and dazzle of the images; and then, with a start, he realized the major was sounding him out about stopping the work.

            <Title>Ch15 - Scratch</Title>
            <Text>He could not recall a single day, from sunrise to sunset, where he hadn’t suffered some shade of misery. He’d either be tired, or hungry, or suffering one of his more difficult to relate afflictions, like the strange sensation of feeling out of breath when he could breathe perfectly fine, or that odd tension in the middle of his chest that would flare up at night and he’d feel as if he’d just run a hundred miles despite the fact that he’d done nothing but lounge in the shade and stare at the shadows of clouds as they crept across the world. He’d never had a good, solid day all the way through, at least, not for as far as he could remember.
His life violated the aesthetic principle of contrast. White is brightest when it’s set against dark. When one is living a life of relative luxury, as Mandri did, it becomes difficult to see the difference between bad and good. Or even pain and pleasure. Prior to being bit by a demon, the worst physical pain he’d ever felt was mere discomfort—when his grandmother pawned his talents from city to city, they traveled in boats without cushioned seats.
He blamed his mother for everything, because when his mother was alive she did not play impressed at the things he made. She’d look at a mud sculpture wrought by his tiny sausage fingers and would point out that it looked like the cast of an intestinal tract. She’d never smile and say, “What a lovely gift, thank you so much for making that for me,” she would call it for what it was and go on about her day. It stood to reason, Mandri reasoned, that he couldn’t be happy as a man because his mother didn’t play dumb enough as he aged from two to six. Those are critical years. Where else but a mother is a child supposed to go for acceptance? Mandri would draw a picture and his mother would say some variation of, ‘this could be better’, and so of course he’d hate it too. And at that age, what is a drawing but an ambitious fling at self expression?
His drawings weren’t good enough, and so he wasn’t good enough, at least not until he reached the age of eight. By then his mother was lost to drink and had run off with a rich man. That’s what his grandmother told him. Much later he learned the truth—she killed herself. The only thing she left him was the knowledge that nothing is good enough, and that people are all of them ugly and full of flaws. And none of these flaws are beauty marks, smudges which when juxtaposed against perfection enhance it.

Mandri began to unscrew the skin’s cap. Moteah stopped him and said, “You wait for the sun to put it on.”
“Oh, right.” 
He then wrapped the oilskin’s strap over his shoulder and neck and they continued on.

 And then there’s the way you talk, the way you act, the way you look—you don’t seem like a person who would thrive out here

But you and Moto seem—don’t take offense, but you seem normal. 

The hastening darkness made it hard to read the Moteah’s mood. “Please don’t fall behind and make me double back.”
“Oh I won’t,” said Mandri. “I think I’ll make it. My leg feels much better thanks to Purl. 


Mandri said, “Do you mind if we talk?”
“Not at all.”
“Well I wanted to ask—what’s your story, you and Moto? Neither of you seem like ordinary outland pokes. None of you are, except for Seb. You’re not the kind of people that belong in the desert.”
“Nobody belongs in the desert,” Moteah said.
“What about the outland tribes?”
“They stick to oases and the wells they carve out of the ground.”
“An oasis is not the desert?”
“No, it is not.”
“Then what are the tribes doing out here?”






“I’m out here for the same reason everyone else is.. Stop talking about the desert like you know anything about it.”
“What’s there to know? It’s hot, there’s sand, demons hiding in holes, and no water.”
Moteah stopped walking, and squatted down like she was about to drop her heavy pack, but instead she reached down and plucked a stone from the ground.
“What’s that?” Mandri asked.
“Squeeze it.”
She handed it over, and Mandri squeezed it. He was surprised to find that it was not a rock, but some sort of bulbous root. Water squirted out of it.
“Okay, there might be water stashed away, but this doesn’t change the fact that you don’t belong out here.”
“No one belongs out here.”
“Where are you from? Zos?”
“Ganniba.”
“Where’s that?”
“Out in the desert,” Moteah said with a smirk. Then she added, “Ganniba used to sit next to a river. Then the Hrks built some canals, diverted the river upstream, and our fields dried up. That was the end of Ganniba. Now it’s part of the Sand.”
“So you were pushed out.”
“After Ganniba, my tribe set up a new home on a river bend in the Subli plain. Nobody lived there because the earth was no good. The Hrks showed up anyway and said we weren’t allowed to be there. They said the only place we were permitted to live was within the Subli delta. I’m sure you know what happens in the Subli delta.”
“I do.”
“We said no thank you. There was a scribe like the one you saw at Minting Rock. He said submit, or fight. We wanted to fight but we didn’t have any weapons. They waited four days for a courier to run to the nearest outpost and fetch a wagon load of spears. They handed them over and we fought with them. Our men had barely eaten in a week, but we fought. I fought. That was the end of my father’s tribe.”
“You seem remarkably well composed about it.”
“It’s not an unusual story.”
“You know, there’s this one outland tribe, called the Sulay, and they got absorbed into the Lord Meskihinne’s lands.”
“You mean they were conquered.”
“Absorbed, conquered, it's the all the same.”
“Absorbed implies that half of them weren’t murdered first.”
“Sure, they were conquered, and then they started farming near one of Meskihinne’s holes. They settled in, became full, upright citizens of Hrk, and guess what they did as soon as they got into politics? I kid you not, I watched a Sulay man argue, well, not argue, he was spitting rage, and he was saying that there was an untouched remnant of the Sulay tribe that needed taming. And this man knew what ‘taming’ meant. He knew what he was asking for. He just wanted their land.”
“What are you saying?”
“I’m saying that Hrk is bad, but I’ve met enough people to know that we’re all more or less the same. If you had the reins of a nation as big as Hrk, you’d be bullying everyone else into doing what you want.”
“That is the exact opposite of what I would do. Just because one old Sulay man had a charred spark, that doesn’t mean everyone is the same way.”

“Please, Mandri. There's a chance out here for my freedom, and not only for me but for all of the Mazydai.”
“The world is full of slaves.”
“Mandri, what do you know about slavery?”
“Excuse me, who is carrying who right now?”
“A fair point.”

“He doesn’t free himself because He doesn’t know what the Hrks have done to His message. That’s why the Hrks burn the saffee leaves—it’s not to ease His pain, it’s to keep Him from discovering their corruption. ”

“I’m referring to the Spark. A Mazid has no true Spark. Also, you should stop calling him ‘Obo’.” Moteah said the name with such contempt that Mandri wasn’t sure if the sting was meant for Obo or for him. 
“But that’s his name.”
“Names are for beings with Sparks.”
“Obo has a Spark.”
“It’s not the same.”
“Is that how you justify your mistreatment of him?”

Like most figures of speech, Moteah’s analogy had a surface charm that suggested a deeper truth, but it completely broke down upon further investigation. 


Obo said, “I’m touched, Mandri.”
“I haven’t touched you.”
“You called me clever.”
“I reserve the right to take it back at any time.”
Obo chuckled. “That’s fine with me, as long as you don’t try and help them free Solraheen.”
“You’re the one that said you’d do it.”
“If they gave me a Spark.”
“Well, then I’ll do it too, if they give me a pound of gold.”
Mandri lifted up his robe. He figured he better make a show of relieving himself even if he didn’t have to pee.

Moteah stopped walking, and squatted down like she was about to drop her heavy pack, but instead she reached down and plucked a gray stone from the ground. She handed it over to Mandri, and said, “Squeeze it.”
Mandri squeezed it, and he was surprised to find that it was not a rock, but some sort of succulent. Water squirted out of it.
“There might be water,” Mandri said as they continued walking. “But 


But if one sits and stares at another human being for long enough, as a portrait artist must do, the features of the face start to lose the illusion that they’re working together for a purpose. It doesn’t matter how attractive the person is, how much woodnut ash they’ve drawn onto their eyebrows to fix them, or how much bug blood they’ve rubbed onto their lips to sell the appearance of health, or how smooth their skin is after brushing it up with the crushed up bones of children. When it came down to it, what a face was, was an odd mix of fleshy protuberances that masquerade as an intelligent being.

This wasn’t necessarily about physical beauty. The attention to physical detail was only a kind of metaphor—inner beauty, outer beauty, that sort of thing. </Text>

Mandri to Purl - how did you do that? In the cave.
	- I can see the threads. Faint glimmer.
	- I can see them too.
	- Make Purl more into weaves and threads - artist of textiles.

Purl - Threads
Mandri - Paint with the Spark

Mandri sees Purl playing with threads. They stick to her. She’s special.


AMALGAMETE - 

Mandri kills Elrahet, feels he is supposed to. Put’s Elrahet’s Spark in to Obo.
Obo kills everyone.

Purl is like fuck, explains that Elrahet was cosmically important.
	- Elrahet should have seen this.

They go down to Shis
	- Mandri consumes Burgeon to find the way.
	- Confront Pell, who says this is the end. She’s going to start with Obo’s Spark.
	- releases horde of demons
	- obo fights them off, tells others to run, but Mandri stays, Obo is ravaged.
	- Mandri buried under bodies.
	- Comes to, Obo is ruined, says, you idiot, you should have ran, I did this for you. 
		- Mandri sees the red threads of purpose lining to Obo’s Spark. 

“Her Spark is weak” - earlier to presage that Purl, with a stronger will, gets stronger.

Out in the desert Mandri himself manipulates a Spark.
Tries with Obo???

Down to Shis

Pell makes it clear that she wants Obo’s spark 

First wave of demons come, Obo succeeds, but is ravaged.
Mandri is joined by others who come to help fight off second wave.

Mandri gives Obo’s Spark to Purl.

Purl reweaves threads to Pell.

Pell is destroyed

Mandri is looked at differently



1.) Demons attack
2.) Obo defends against overwhelming odds to try and save the others
3.) Mandri sees the solution involving Obo/Elrahet’s spark.
4.) Eliminates Pell.
5.) Allows for Company to escape.</Text>

            <Title>Godsight</Title>
            <Text>The first floor of the blackstone Western Tower was composed of a single dark hallway running north to south. In the middle of this hall, on either side, were two sets of wide-wood double doors that opened up into large, dust-strewn storage rooms with empty floors. At the end of the hall was a spiraling staircase.
The second floor of the tower was a single enormous room which wrapped around a central pillar. There were two narrow windows in this room, one which looked west, towards the corpse-strewn courtyard and the Goree Pass, and the other looked east, out towards the desert and the Hrkan line. This desert view was obstructed by the rim-lit silhouettes of the Ayramun as they jostled with each other to get a better look at the Hrkan horse and rider.
Ayram and  Elrahet were somewhere out there, ready to meet the fate they’d bought with the lives of their companions.
Mandri watched all this from his seat on the staircase. When he was sure no one would notice, he ducked down into the dark of the first floor to dab one meager droplet of juice from the God’s Eye burgeon onto his tongue—no more than that. The idea was to escape himself, not end up catatonic like before. He then plugged the tiny hole he’d made in the burgeon with a rolled up sliver of woolen rag, and he stuffed the blessed burgeon into the pocket of his sleeve to save for later. If he rationed it carefully, he reasoned, he could make the juice last for a week. The rest he’d roll flat and dry out, and from there he’d experiment to discover the best method of ingestion. He wouldn’t rule anything out. Then, he would steal another.
He sat down on the fourth stair-step and waited there in the dark for the burgeonsight to take hold. He knew it wouldn’t take long.
“Where’s Mandri?” Purl asked from above.
Mandri hid his disappointment well when he said, “I’m down here!”
He didn’t want his absence noted, lest Seb put two and two together, so he climbed back up stairs to join the others.
Purl was the only one who wasn’t glued to the western window. She was sitting against the curving wall, still strapped into her pack. 
“Don’t take it off,” she said to Mandri when she noticed him starting to unshoulder his own burden. 
“Why not?”
“We need to be ready to run.”
“It only takes a second to put it on.”
“Leave it on,” said Purl, demanding.
“Fine.” 
Mandri plopped himself down right next to Purl, pack and all. He leaned into her and said, “Do you have any idea how we’re supposed to get out of this?”
“Ayram has a plan,” she said flatly, as if she didn’t believe it either.
“Didn’t seem like it to me. His words, if I recall, were, ‘I’ll figure it out’.”
“When he says that it’s because he knows we won’t like the plan.”
“I see.”
“Why are you sweating?”
“I’m stressed. And my pack is heavy.”
“But it’s cold in here.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t know.”
He wasn’t about to admit that he’d just swallowed a single milky tear of a God’s Eye burgeon, and it was making his heart skip beats. Strangely, it wasn’t doing anything for his vision.
Purl saw him sigh and asked, “Are you that worried about the Mazid?”
“You mean Obo?”
“The first time I saw that Mazid, I watched it kill thirty Ayramun.”
“Wasn’t that the fault of his Minder?”
“He still should have apologized. At least, he shouldn’t be a prick about it.”
“I think there’s only so much you can expect from a Sparkless Mazid. They’re deceitful…prideful…irritating.”
“And ugly,” said Purl.
Mandri sank back into his pack, which was quite comfy to lean into with all the new additions. “Somehow, it’s all part of Obo’s charm. Like, somehow, if you take all those things together they all cancel each other out and it’s not so bad. Or maybe it’s just that everybody hates him and that’s why I’m drawn to him. It’s like, I mean…I don’t know…we get along.”
That droplet from the God’s Eye burgeon wasn’t doing anything to lighten his mood. It wasn’t expanding the ceiling into infinity, it wasn’t swirling the colors of the floor. It certainly wasn’t tamping down on the feeling of guilt that was stirring way down in his stomach. His legs were heating up.
He considered spritzing his tongue with some more of that burgeon juice, then decided against it. He should be bearing witness to Obo’s final waking moments—and they were his final moments, because even if this little gambit succeeded, there was no way the Ayramun were going to make it all the way to Jeket, much less free Solraheen. If he didn’t walk to that tower window and watch, then the memory of Obo’s passing would be the sole property of people who didn’t care.
Mandri shuffled his legs underneath him into a frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up.
“Going to watch?” Purl asked.
“Might as well.”
 There wasn’t room enough for him at the window, between all those excited elbows. Then Moto decided that he was needed down below, so he left, and Mandri was able to squeeze himself into the picture before Seb and Moteah could close ranks.
He peered out over the sprawl of back shattered rocks leading out into the bright red desert, and after a moment of admiring the glow of day, and wondering when the God’s Burgeon would arrive, he blinked, and a rainbow light flashed across his vision.
He gasped and shut his eyes, but closed, his sight was flooded by that rainbow light, and it churned, and churned against his lids, forcing his eyes back open. Now his vision was a burst of color, pulsing through the spectrum—first red, into orange, and on, and on, and when this faded, the world was not the same as it was before.
What he saw was akin to burgeonsight, only far greater, for more than glistening surfaces he saw the fibrous iridescent light of unveiled purpose shining out from under the skin of every surface. This white-yet-spectrumed light was swimming under the sand, churning in the tower’s shadow, breathing out the tower itself. Tufted strands sparkled up out of the black stone of the window-sill underneath Mandri’s fingers—every element here and was bristling with the flighty colored fibers of purpose, and these fibers took flight and were hereby joined in Mandrameen’s eye, for his sight was the spindle that bound them together into a thread that wound back out through his widened iris and into the world, a yarn spun tight, a continuous threading and rethreading of purpose.
Threads of scintillating spectrumed light swirled out of the stomachs of the figures below—there winding out of Ayram and Elrahet, out of the horse, out of its blue-robed rider and black-robed Riga child.
Mandri caught his breath and realized time itself had stopped. The figures below were stuck in dynamic, limb-bent postures, seemingly fixed by the brilliant thread into a pyramidal frame—Ayram and Elrahet anchored bottom corners, the scribe on his white horse towered into a point. This was true purpose here, and where the purpose was strongest, the threads burned white. They keeling into the scribe, for he did not represent Hrkan power advantaged on a proud steed, he was that power, and in his lap was the Riga child, the very embodiment of Hrk’s assault on the sanctity of creation. White threads swirled around Ayram, who was not a symbol of the outland peoples, he was their paragon. Glowing brightest were all those threads connected to Elrahet, who was herself the very essence of the Sand given agency. Lying on the ground, woven into the middle of this divine tapestry, was Mazidobo, a creature constructed for the sole purpose of setting the affairs of humanity in order, and look where he was, destitute in the dirt, scarred and cowering and naked. The others looked past him as if he weren’t there at all.
Mandri lamented the lack of materials. If he’d only had a stick of charcoal and a board he could start sketching then and there. The urge to do so was overwhelming, for the scene was pleading with him to be given its own sacred body, a painting in a frame, an object to which the iridescent threads of the moment’s purpose could move about the world and inject their meaning into every future moment.
If he didn’t sketch it out now as he saw it, details would be forgotten. After one night’s sleep they'd be lost forever.
He was forced instead to imprint the scene upon his mind as best he could. He kept his eye jumping from detail to detail and back again, and then back again, and again, and again, and at each stop he beheld the object—an act beyond mere noticing. This was the artist's noticing, the lover's noticing, covetous noticing, jealous noticing, noticing to remember. Beholding not a lossless art, but what gets lost has chance of being reconstructed later.
He ran through the details again like a common sundry list.
The arc of the tower’s shadow splitting the scene in half. 
The coolness of color inside that shadow and its subtle, sumptuous grays, almost blue.
The size disparity between Ayram and Elrahet—both dark and shrouded in that tower’s shadow. 
The wind flicked hem of Elrahet’s desert-bitten robe.
The Hrkan horse, a splendid white horse—white as chalk. It’s brushed muscles glistened in the light of the sun. It’s neck was as wide as Ayram’s shoulders. It’s richly braided half-flicked in anxiousness.
Sitting in the brown saddle was the Hrkan scribe. His dark skin was reddened and glistening with kell oil. The trail of his blue robe was filigreed with golden leaves. His right arm cradled the black-bundled Riga with care. 
Obo on the ground. Pale. Fly-swatted. Staring at the sky. So perfect was the staging that the warm spectral edge of the tower's penumbra cut right across his stomach. 
The rest of the world—the black tower bricks, the mush of shattered rock and sand—these were static things and could be ignored because they could be revisited later. It was an injustice, abstracting them out as if they weren't bound by the bristling with purpose, but Mandri knew it was more than he could manage.
He ran through the details again, though his eyelids were feeling heavy. He noticed that in all this time he hadn’t blinked.
He shouldn’t blink.
He should keep them open.
Notice the arc of the tower’s shadow—that hadn't changed.
Ayram and Elrahet still stood resolute.
The horse hadn’t even shifted it’s weight. It’d been standing on two feet this whole time. Wonderful. 
He licked his lips. His mouth was dry. Burgeons have a way of doing that.
A new detail—the white line of Hrkan soldiers hanging in the distance. It would take a large canvas to accommodate them, and a lot of paint. He twinged at the thought having to fill up so large a frame.
Should he include the light of purpose? How to paint it?
He would have to worry about that later. The details need accounting.
A new detail—Ayram’s spear—how had he missed it? The dark tip of that spear formed an unsightly tangent with the horse’s leather stirrup, such that the stirrup and accompanying harness seemed to sprout out from the spear’s haft. This element would need to be fixed. It flattened the image. Mandri could adjust the angle of the bar in Ayram’s hand so that it needn’t intersect with the stirrup at all.
Would it be sacrilegious to alter this image in any way?
Was the angle of the spear part of the purpose?
Did he miss anything?
Yes, there was a vulture up in the sky. Mandri wished it wasn’t there, because a vulture circling the scene was too on the nose. People might start to think that this was all his own doing. Maybe he should remove the vulture.
No, that would be a step too far. 
He would have to include the vulture.
A new detail—sound. And now that he noticed it, all the sounds of the scene were coming at him in one long exhale. The faint scream of the vulture. The wind whistling over the mountains. The sparkling swish of whipping sand. A shrill whistle.
A whistle?
The Riga’s whistle.
He blinked, and suddenly the scene smashed into him. He shut his eyes and yelped, for the Riga’s shrill split into his head . He opened his eyes again just in time to see Obo’s gray Spark zipping out of his body and into the Riga’s mouth. Then Ayram roared, charged, and stabbed at the scribe with his spear. The scribe’s horse whinnied in fright, and reared as its rider was skewered up under his ribs.
“Mandri!”
The call had come from behind him.
He spun around and was surprised to find that Moteah and Seb were no longer squeezing against his shoulders, in fact, they weren’t even in the room. Gone, too, was the iridescent light of purpose that flooded his vision—there was only the stark, cold interior of the tower’s second level, deserted save for Purl who stood waist deep in the stairwell across the room. Her face was alight with wide-eyed urgency. “Come on!” she shouted, and then she ducked away down the stairs.
Mandri blinked in confusion.
He spun back around to the window so that he could narrate for Purl the magnificence of the scene below, but Ayram was already running back towards the tower, with Elrahet’s head popping out of the top of his backpack. Obo, and the Riga were gone. The Hrkan scribe lay flat on his stomach, face down into a thickening pool of his own blood. His frightened steed was charging hard into the emptiness of open desert. The Hrkan soldiers beyond had spread themselves out into a long white line—a net of swords marching towards the tower in double time. 
“Well, shit,” Mandri muttered.
Fear gripped him. He ran as fast as could towards the stairs, but each step was a chore for his limbs were thick with the lethargy left by the passing of the God’s Eye sight.
He staggered down the stairs and into the darkness of the first floor hallway. Here, the true bewilderment set in and his stomach turned. His throat made to vomit—his chest heaved three violent times, but the only thing to come of this wrenching were stray strings of spittle. He thanked Solraheen for the closeness of the cold stone walls, else he might not have managed to stumble out into the tower’s gateway tunnel.
“What are you doing!?” Purl shouted.
She had been waiting for him in the courtyard with the pilgrims.
“Hurry up!” she shouted.
Mandri followed her and fixed his eyes on the wheel-rutted path, thinking as best he could about his next step instead of the horror of the scene around him. That captivating light of purpose was nowhere to be seen around these poles. They weren’t anywhere. They had well and truly gone.
Mandri shouted, “It was incredible!”
Purl didn’t listen.
He chased her into the shadow of that god-stricken cleft of earth called the Goree Pass.</Text>

            <Text>Most Outland tribes believe that when the land was pulled up from the waters it came out as a solid whole, one earth surrounded by one ocean. When the sun rose it shined on everything at once—birds, bushes, beasts, and humans, as well as the twin brother gods, Solraheen and Schisol.
Schisol did not like this arrangement. Humanity was trampling all over His brother’s sacred gardens. He wanted humanity kept apart, so He smashed His fists into the ground and split the land in two. In one cataclysmic afternoon Jandri became an island continent. 
How great the trembling must have been when the Hias mountains were torn apart. How incredible it had to be to see an ocean of fish, shark, and noodly leviathan tumble into green valleys. It is said that for a day all the ocean beasts frolicked in the sumbmerged forests and fields, and all that movement is the reason why the waters of the Shalbrum sea flows so fast today.
But Schisol was an idiot. Having pushed Jandri out into the ocean, He unwittingly pushed it closer to the sun. The unremitting heat bore down on the lush environs, withering them into dust. In His bid to save His brother’s garden from the ravages of humanity, Schisol had destroyed it instead. To add insult to injury, humans eventually built boats and sailed across the sea, settling Jandri and spreading out to farm every inch of good black earth.
Meskalim was one of the first cities to rise up on the new continent. On the earliest maps it was nothing but a nameless black dot sitting halfway down Jandri’s western rim. Nobody cared for a small flesh market that merchant barges skipped on the way down around the horn and east to Jeket.
This all changed when a young slave girl slipped and fell into a hole. 
What that girl was doing in the foothills of the Hias mountains, so far from the city, only Solraheen knows. Some say that she was lured down into that hole by a demon, because the entrance to that abyss was nothing but a black sliver in the grass—impossible to find unless one knew where it was. But what’s important is that when the girl was rescued from the earth she was clutching a nugget of gold.
The shepherd who found her went back to that crack the next day with an oil lamp. Not twelve feet down and his eye caught the glint of a gold stringer slanting sideways through the granite. He followed it through a tight-fitting pocket, and there in that fracture he found a vein of gold that was wider than his arms could stretch. 
Mines were driven into the hills. This was ages before the age of Hrkan science, so no real thought was given to managing the uncountable tons of rock that were pressing down on the blooming network of tunnels. When the people of Meskalim dug into the earth they put up wood beams and packed the walls tight with a stiffening mud, but that was it. They didn’t understand that the granite there was fiercely jointed and that a beam supporting one rock might be doing nothing for another just a few inches away. It all looked like one big rock in the dim light of torches. The odd cave-in should have served as a warning. One might be tempted to say these ancient peoples didn’t understand the danger because they were blinded by greed, but the simpler truth was that they were invincibly ignorant. 
Meskalim became a golden city on the maps of a golden age. Its thousand white domes were enameled with sacred geometry. Its boulevards were filled with all the peoples of the world. Its army was twice the size of any other. Its port was the very center of the earth. 
All of this because of gold. Solraheen’s stone, called as such because gold is as bright and as immutable as the divine. Leave it in the dirt for a million years and it will stay as brilliant as the day it was interred. Roll it around in the hands and it provokes a yearning akin to spiritual rapture—a yearning for more, for as much as one can get.
The folk of Meskalim devoted their lives to it. They followed the gold wherever it went, and it went everywhere, even under the city itself. At the peak of the frenzy a person could get drunk and lost between Meskalim’s three hills, then dig straight down, and likely as not they’d pop out into a tunnel. 
One day a miner slammed his pick into the wrong hairline crack. A jet of water shot out, and the waters of the Shalbrum sea flooded in. When the thinned bedrock fell, the golden city above fell with it. More than five hundred thousand people were swallowed up in the slush of earth, though the number grows larger with each retelling.
Humans are redoubtable creatures when gold is at hand, so it didn’t take long for the city to be rebuilt from scratch further south. Meskalim the second swelled anew, though it would never be as grand as the first, for whenever a nugget of gold was pulled from the ground it was stored in a dockside warehouse before being shipped across the sea or down and around to Jeket. Folks feared the earth might open up at any time to eat their treasures, so common sense demanded that the wealth would be better used elsewhere.
And so, for a thousand years, Meskalim’s temple was poor and its people poorer. Its streets weren’t laid out with any sense, much less paved, and these mucky avenues didn’t adhere to the natural contours of the land because when someone wanted to build a house they simply plopped it down wherever inspiration struck. And these houses were ugly things, shouldn’t be called houses—they were dwellings, crumpled slugs of mud, lumber, and straw with windowless walls all askew. There wasn’t a true roof beam in all the lower city. A horde of these things were smashed up against each other like one big deposit of mud that the Istil wind had just happened to blow together.
Mandri couldn’t stand the sight of it unless he was deep in a burgeon binge.
Unfortunately, he had to pace his beer because he couldn’t afford to be so run through that he couldn’t walk. He had to feather the beer’s effect, take sips from his beer-skin every hundred staggered steps or so to keep himself bouncing off that point of no return. It was a dangerous game, taking off the edge in chunks, but it was one he was determined to play to avoid thinking. Primarily he was fleeing from the memory of that old witchy bitch’s bloody, haunting face. If he didn’t keep moving, she might pop out of the clouds and smash right through his belly like she’d done to Gil.
The constant patter of a wispy rain was helping to keep him grounded. And, dare he think it, Meskalim looked somehow pretty in the gray light of a sun shining though rain clouds. But surely, this beauty was the work of the burgeons. Mandri had seen his reflection in a puddle, and his pupils were blown so wide that the smallest slight of light could get in there, bounce around, and blind him to all ugliness. Every surface sparkled. The falling rain dazzled. Even the cool muck welling up between his toes as he splashed along Meskalim’s streets was flecked with radiant light.
The more Mandri drank, the more the burgeonsight played with light and wetness. It seemed as if the sparkling bits of light themselves were tangible, like he could get them glommed up in between his fingertips and lick them. Perhaps this oily celestial film that coated every surface was always there it took burgeonsight to see it.
He lingered in the middle of an empty crossroad, surrounded by some of the blobbiest mud-caked slums in all of Meskalim. Each roof was topped off with little nipple chimneys and there wasn’t a wooden door in sight—only rags hanging down to cover their lamplit, onion-smelling, fly-biting interiors. Mandrameen stood, motionless, back hunched, hair drenched, brown robe slipping off his shoulder, for he was struck dumb by the sight of his own hand.
He held it up and studied it. His own skin was sparkling. In the hollow of his palm was a pool of that starry substance. He tried to touch the little sparkles, tried to rub them off, but that was no good because his fingers were sparkling too. This wasn’t merely wetness, he was sure of it.
He licked his index finger and a heavenly sensation flooded into into his mouth. It was a tingling flavor that tasted like honey mixed with the vigor of youth. It tasted like the smell of a field of wildflowers. It tasted like apple-juice mixed with god.
He squealed with delight. 
He bent down and scraped up a dollop of mud with his finger, then licked it. Again, his mouth was flooded with the flavor. 
He rushed over to the nearest mud-caked wall, where an awning protected some large clay pots from the rain. He knelt down and licked the handles, the rims, the bodies. Again he tasted that divine flavor. There was a little brown pup shivering behind one of these pots, and Mandri picked the little beast up by it’s scruff and licked it, and it, too, tasted of heaven.
He dropped the pup and opened his mouth to the sky and tried to lick the air to check if the air itself was suffused with this substance. His tongue was caught mid-curl when a disgusted voice shot out of the rain, saying, “Get lost you freak!”
Mandri spun around, feet sliding in the mud. He raised his hands to defend himself, but there was no one there, nothing but glistening mounds of mud, soggy rags, and the sound of rain plunking off the broken clay pots that piled up in every nook and cranny.
Mandri couldn’t see the Meskalimi eyes peeping out at him, but he could damn well feel them. These destitutes were hiding in their hovels of slop and they were judging him.
Them judging him.
They could not see what he saw. Their dim-sighted eyes could only see a too-skinny young man standing in the muck, hackles raised, licking the air like a maniac.
“You do not see what I see!” Mandri shouted.
“Get lost!”
 Mandri spun around again, trying to place the voice, then hissed when he realized there might be more than one of them speaking out.
“I see Solraheen’s light!” he shouted.
“GET LOST!”
Mandri yelped and took off running.
He ran and ran, following the road wherever it was going. He stopped when he realized that he was liable to slip and crack his skull. He also realized he’d dropped his beer-skin somewhere along the way. He thought about going back and trying to find it, but that wasn’t possible, because he didn’t know where he was and what paths he’d taken to get here. 
There is one way to orient oneself inside Meskalim—memorize all the faces of Meskalim’s central hill. The hill towered over the rumps and clumps of mud that was the city proper. The hill itself was studded with proper white buildings, each clinging to the hill like barnacles on a washed up corpse. These were the various offices of Hrkan government, as well as the mansions of the people who staffed them. It just so happened that when Mandri looked up at Meskalim’s hill, he was looking at the house of Salavan Soreen. As governor of Meskalim, Salavan’s house claimed a privileged vista at the top of the hill’s southern cliff face. Its wide balcony leered over the rest of the city below, and over Mandri, reminding him what he was supposed to be doing. 
He set off at a stuttering trot.
Along the way he stole a knife, because who leaves a stout little knife laying outside in a bowl of kakanut shells? Someone who wants it stolen, that’s who. Mandri simply complied. He also needed it more, so by divine right it was his. 
He knotted the knife up in the folds of his robe that hung loose around his waist, and he found that if he bent forward a bit, then the bulge of the knife’s handle would get lost amongst the folds. So he walked, stooping a little, all the way up Meskalim’s hill. It was hard trudging. His legs were completely out of wire when he came upon Salavan’s house. The damned thing was surrounded by a monstrous white wall. If he was going to kill Meskalim’s governor, he needed it to move.
Mandri hated walls. He’d always believed that walls had gone too far beyond their original scope. The first walls were knee-high stacks of stones set out in pastures to mark boundaries between goat herds—a pure and wholesome purpose. This wall, Salavan’s wall, was among the most perverse. It was huge, four-men tall, and its purpose was to stand there and look daunting so that poor people didn’t get any ideas. Most walls that big in a place as wet as Meskalim are streaked with black and yellow grime dripping to the street, but Salavan’s wall was pristine. Its plaster was as smooth and as white as the day it was slathered on. No doubt Salavan spent more money cleaning that wall than he spent on bread for widows and orphans, or for anything for anyone. That wall was more important than human life, more important than Mandri’s life. That wall’s raw materials could buy at least fifty Mandrameens. Its maintenance? At least five Mandris a year.
At least this wall was doing a job in keeping him out. Some walls on the lower rungs of Meskalim’s hill couldn’t keep out a flying shit. They’re purely decorative. Imagine that—a decorative wall—it’s not even trying to fend off the poors, all it's doing is letting them know they aren’t liked.
Mandri stood there in front of Salavan’s wall like an idiot. The burgeonsight was warping all the little dimples and scratches and faint finger-drags that were imprinted there in the plaster. Mandri couldn’t shake the feeling that the wall was daring him, like a schoolyard bully, to just try to breach it and see what happens.
There was a squared-out arch in the middle of this wall, and underneath this arch was an ironwood gate guarded by two thugs on either side. These brawny men were huddled close to the gate so as to squeeze themselves inside the narrow shelter of the arch. It wasn’t doing them much good. They were as sodden as Mandri. Like everything else, the burgeonsight was making them sparkle. That didn’t stop them from looking like demons.
In the best of light, a Meskalimi thug’s face is an unsettling thing. A lifetime of trading violence for money fixes a man’s expression into a state of permanent concern, and once the brow and cheek gets slashed with scars, the whole thing takes on a look of putrefied misery. Blur that face a little with rain, twist it a little with burgeonsight, and now it’s a demon’s face that could bend the bravest spine. And that’s what Mandri saw when he looked at those two thugs guarding Salavan’s gate, he saw full-blooded demons.
And they had swords—short, street-wise swords clipped high up on the belt.
Mandri believed that his burgeonsight, waning though it was, revealed the truth and showed these ‘men’ for what they were—actual demons. They couldn’t be full-fledged demons, because such demons should be tasked with more important things than watching a gate. They would be greasing the feet of backsliding priests, or tricking young beauties into thinking that taking it up the bum doesn’t count.
It then occurred to Mandri that he didn’t know why he was actually going through with all this. Ostensibly, he was here to placate the fury of a demon witch, but until this moment, standing in front of this stupid white wall, he hadn’t actually considered the possibility of not showing up. Pell had told him to go and see Salavan, and now here he was, seeing about Salavan. 
Perhaps he wasn’t fully in control of his own faculties.
Perhaps Pell had puppeteered him.
Or perhaps it was the burgeons.
One of the demons peeked out from under the arch and shouted, “Hey—scram, boy!”
“Git yous butt gawn,” the other said. His vowels were as stubborn as a mule.
Do demons have regional accents?
It sounded like this demon grew up in a sun-slum near Iskabat.
The first demon had no doubt crawled out of a Jeketian gutter, for his lilt and swagger could only have come from someone steeped in the capital of the Hrkan world.
Mandri caught his wits and said, “I’m here to see Salavan Soreen.”
The two demons looked at each other. A whispered word was shared.
The first of them asked, “Why?”
The other asked, “Whatchu gawtta knife fur?”
Mandri looked down and saw that he was gripping his knife so tight that his knuckles were white. 
“Oh...uh…sorry.”
The demon from Iskabat pulled his short sword from its scabbard and he brandished it at Mandri. 
He said, “Cuhm an get dem feengahs cut.”
Mandri stepped back and waved his hands in clear submission. He said, “I’m here because Pell sent me.”
“Pell sent you?” the Jeketian demon asked.
Mandri nodded.
“What’s your name?”
“Mandrameen.”
The Iskabati demon grunted and the Jeketian slouched back against the gate. Evidently, they had been expecting him.
The Iskabati waved his sword and said, “Poop thuh lil’ hippy.”
“What?”
“Drop the knife,” said the Jeketian.
“Why?”
“Are you dumb? You’re not getting inside with a knife.”
It seemed unwise to give up the knife. If Mandri handed it over and passed through the gate he’d be ambling into the clutches of a Salavan without the means to defend himself.
Probably, he would die. 
But what good was a Mandri wielded knife against a demon king?
He’d die with or without it.
He could run away.
But where would he go? He would probably die in a gutter within a week.
If there were alternative options, Mandri couldn’t see them because burgeonsight has a rooting effect, it roots a person into the present, makes it hard to see into the future. There were an infinite number of possible paths his life’s direction could take, and presumably some of these didn’t lead to a quick death. Burgeonsight narrowed it down to just one—go through the gate.
Some people say that this is why burgeons are bad for a person’s Spark. They say that burgeons make people ignorant of the future and so they don’t plan for it, and the next thing that happens is a ruined life. Mandri would argue that everyone walks through life’s infinite possibilities with their eyes set on a narrow array of options, so if sober people are ignoring an effective infinity, what’s the harm in taking a burgeon to ignore a couple more? At least he wasn’t trying to build walls, those literal embodiments of the restriction of possibility. What’s worse than burgeons is building a wall and funneling only the ‘good’ things through the gate. These people are higher on fear than Mandri had ever been on burgeons.
He dropped the knife.
The Hrkan demon opened the gate’s cutout door and motioned Mandri in.
The door clanged behind him, and a shiver ran through his spine.
It’s amazing how fast he could come to regret a decision.

            <Title>Shulgi</Title>
            <Text>There were three people in Ayram’s backpack. Two were dead—Obo and the Riga—and their elbows, shoulders, wrists, and hips bulged the bottom leather. Elrahet sat on top of them, her head was poked out the top, ancient but very much alive. She glared out at the rest of the Ayramun who lagged behind.
“Faster!” she barked. 
The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a wide canyon valley, but Ayram’s pace was furious, and he scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree, and Mandri had a hard time following. At the top was a shelf of sturdy rock, and they bumbled along this parallel road for a finger until it dead ended into a crack which ran right through a solid wall of reddish stone. The crack’s opening was hardly an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders, but Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
 Mandri’s arms and legs bumped and scraped against the striated walls, layers of red and off-red rock stacked on top each other composed dramatic sweeping forms that towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky. The sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he ran along, and such was the height and cant of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mushy pile of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
Mandri might have savored the scene if he wasn’t having such a hard time keeping up with the blistering pace. The way twisted and bent, right and left, and he was so far behind that he rarely caught a glimpse of Purl, much less anyone else beyond her. He was chasing the sounds of their paddling feet, and that was enough until he was confronted with a fork in the path. The Ayramun had charged ahead without sparing care for him.
Mandri forced himself up and he scuttled onwards, finding untapped energy in his legs. This new path curved around and almost ran back on itself, then gradually meandered north. The way was rough, and soon a whole hand had passed, measured out by the oppressive eye of the sun as it crossed the thin bridge of blue above. The air was heating up, and unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off Mandri’s skin the moment it beaded up. He ran on and on, and the longer he ran, the soggier his robe and brow became. Few feelings are more uncomfortable than that of a soggy lower back being patted by a heavy pack. The vortex of steamy air that emerged there in that gap was a weather system unto itself, and this self-sustaining convection current, shaped by the contours of muscle and spine, was there to stay as he didn’t have time to throw off his pack, rip off his shirt, and rag himself dry.

“No backtalk—and that goes for you too, Seb. You been getting uppity these days, and it’s time to stop.”
Seb scoffed at this sudden turn. 
“I don’t backtalk,” he said. “I give suggestions.”
“No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
When Ayram was confident that Seb had absorbed enough of his ire to fall in line, he turned again to Mandri.
“You understand?”
Mandri nodded.
“Say it.”
“I understand.”
“Good—but for now you’ll be following Moto.”
Moto perked up. “Me? Where are you going?”
“I’m going to scout for the Hrks,” said Ayram. Then he added, smiling, “and if I happen to smash a demon’s skull on the way, then the world is better for it.”
“Where you want to meet up?”
“Greskalun or no Greskalun, we’re going to Shulgi. If the Mazyd was right, it will be empty. We’ll meet up there, in the highest columned room. If you’re not there, don’t worry…I’ll find you.”
With that, he grabbed his iron spear and leapt up the western slope, jumping from rock to rock with a dexterous, grace that defied his giant frame.
His leaving left an uneasy silence which stayed unbroken until Elrahet growled in disappointment. Without Ayram to carry her, she’d have to walk.
She climbed out of the pack and stretched her legs.
“Whose going to carry these two?” She asked, kicking the bag of bodies.
Moto, standing a little straighter now that he was in charge, said, “I think it’s time Mandri pulled his own weight.”
Moto reached down into Ayram’s pack and pulled out Obo’s pale and lifeless corpse by the neck. Then he grabbed Mandri’s litter and stuffed Obo into it as best he could.
“I’ll carry Obo,” Mandri said, “but I’m telling you, I cannot carry both of them. My back is already near breaking.”
Moto froze, looked Mandri square in the eye and said, “You’ll do what I tell you to do.” This was, unquestionably, a threat of violence. Mandri shrank back and raised his hands to surrender. Moteah laughed.
“You got something to say?” Moto asked to his sister.
“Oh come on,” said Moteah. “Look at him. He’s a twig, he can’t carry all that.”
Moto’s jaw went tight. He stood up even straighter. His nose flared as he sniffed that elevated air of authority. He pointed a finger at Moteah and declared, “Then you will carry the Riga.”
Moteah scoffed and settled into an incredulous pose, hand-on-sidethrust-hip, and not to be outskilled in art of finger-wagging, she flicked hers right back at Moto and said, “How about, for once, you take up the weight when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a slapback lizard unfurling it’s frills he rolled back and puffed his chest.
Seb spat a wad of borcandi juice in between the siblings. “I’ll carry it,” he grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop barkin’ and we can get on with it, I’ll carry the damn thing.”
“There’s no room in your pack,” said Moto.
“For Sol’s sake, lash it to my back then.”
Seb unshouldered his pack and dropped it at Moto’s feet. Moto, unhappy with Seb’s act of charity, kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he pulled the limp Riga child up and out of Ayram’s sagging pack. A few wraps and knots of vinecord later, and the dead Riga was fixed into a makeshift harness against Seb’s pack. 
Seb bore his new burden with the stolidity of an ox, and he charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though his springy kick-step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the weight. It was a frightful sight, the Riga child. It was swaddled in black from head to toe, bundled like a block of meat, and as Seb walked the child’s head lolled from side to side.
Elrahet followed after him, and then Purl followed after her, and then Moteah brushed by her brother with a smirk.
Obo hadn’t fit neatly into Mandri’s pack—he’d been squashed down into the side of it, and his arms were folded up and stuck straight up into the air like a rabbit’s ears. When Mandri got the pack settled on his shoulders, the bouncing unset the arms and the elbows went limp and the forearms banged against the back of Mandri’s head.
Moto stopped him from fixing the issue.
“Walk,” he said, and Mandri walked, and they walked like that until they 
As day progressed the canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky overhead dimmed into purpler hues. It was near the golden hour when their path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau.
Mandri turned and admired the distance covered and was startled to see a bewildering maze of canyon cracks that stretched out for miles before fading into the dark rift of the Pass. They had made it out in one piece. They had made it to the home of the Greskalun—Shulgi, a sanctuary, a structure at once a building and a mountain, at once a fat, flat-topped chunk of natural stone and a richly ornamented temple whose walls were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes—circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles, and these shapes joined together to roughly resemble faces—animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval the size of two-floor building demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the nose of a snarling demon. It was patterns inside of patterns, lines inside of lines. And one must crane the neck to look up at it, for Shulgi was set on top of a sloping hill of rock rubble, rubble laid down by both the despoiling hands, time and humanity.
Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders of humanity get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights Shulgi should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered serve well to heighten the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the crown of crowns, and that’s even after accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays made the structure seem to burst in flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they’d have a much easier time of it because the building was a hollow husk. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arches, each as empty of candlelight as the next. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a pretty lizard woman. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
Moto jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramless file. He led them all up the well-trodden slope to the foot of a long flight of stairs that led up to the temple entrance. These were troublesome stairs and there were at least a hundred of them, and they were steep and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms for they each had their own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.
Three steps up and Mandri noticed a dark stain climbing up the stairs with him as he went. He guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be a number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement—a temple that large had to have drainage somewhere, though yes, it would be odd that they’d have it running out the front door. 
But he knew it was blood. 
Of course it was blood. There were demons about and no people where people were expected to be—it had to be blood. Blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under skin, it explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple’s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. Then his eyes alighted on the temple entrance, which itself had been sculpted in that curvilinear language into the head of a viper. It’s fangs were similarly stained by that dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the building itself had eaten the Greskalun. 
They crossed the pillared court at decent clip. Moto drew his sword as if he were about to do battle with the building itself. He stopped before crossing the threshold, he peered inside, then drew away and said, “We’ll wait for Ayram somewhere else.”
Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion, “I’m not going back down,” she said. “I climbed up these steps and I’ll be damned if I don’t stick my head in and see what’s happened.”
“No,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram said that we should only wait inside the temple if it was empty.”
“Someone get a torch going,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moteah was a step ahead of her, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks that Purl was holding. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.
Moto yanked the torch out of Purl’s hands.
“Ayram put me in charge,” he said.
Elrahet sneered and said, “Take charge of your wits and march yourself inside. Or you can run away and explain to Ayram why you left his witch all alone.”
Moto stewed in a wordless anger. Composed himself, and thrust the torch into the temple interior. 
As soon he did, a swarm of bats screeched in the darkness and took flight. Their wingbeats battered the torch smoke as they swirled out of the viper’s mouth. The bats swerved along the temple wall and then disappeared back into some unseen hole.
Elrahet snarled and said, “Aren’t you a little big to be scared of bats?”
“There’s more than bats in there and you know it,” Moto declared. “It smells too foul to be empty.”
“He’s right,” said Purl. “It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“I suppose you would know.”
“Get a move on,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone filtered in behind. Mandri made sure he was last to enter.
Shulgi’s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a barge, and thrice as long. The torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dugout into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that was filled to the brim with white ash. Wind and time had swept some of this ash around the room, with trails of it sprinkling the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing the Ayramun, was a man sitting cross-legged.
Moto waved his torch back and forth. The man did not move. Moto shouted, “Hello there!”, but his words echoed unheard around the room. The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was his bald, ash splattered head.
“Probably dead,” marked Seb.
“Oh, you think so?” said Moto.
“You’re the one that said ‘hello’ to it.”
Elrahet held out her hand towards Moto and made a grasping motion, requesting the torch. Moto handed it over, and with it’s light leading the way, she hobbled towards the mysterious figure.
“He must’ve been eating mice,” said Moto as he kicked a the small spine that was lying on the floor.
“Or bats,” said Seb.
Now that Mandri knew they were there, he was noticing the scattered remains of creatures all over the place—thin boned lizard legs, bats, perhaps foxes, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. 
Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that cross-legged figure and poked him hard with her staff.
The man fell onto his side. The thud of his impact kicked up a cloud of ash.
“He is indeed dead,” Elrahet declared. “And he is a not a man, or not wholly a man, I should say.”
She bent down and rubbed the dead man’s robe in between her fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “This is the raiment of Greskal’s prince. Is that what you are, do you think? Are you young Greskaleen, or a scrounger with a stolen robe?”
Elrahet’s inquisitive demeanor gave Mandri the courage to carry himself into the room. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be ‘inside’—that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so long wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were dead bats and a dead body? So what if there were demons lurking in the shadows? It was good to flaunt these ominous things because if he didn’t, he’d probably faint. He wanted desperately to steel himself against the fear because he’d noticed a faint golden glimmer in the back of the room. He walked towards, and his wish came true, there was indeed, at the back of the entrance hall, shining faintly in the torch’s dancing light, an enormous golden statue of Solraheen.
As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a rare Old Jandri from where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling—a form outlawed by Hrk for this was sacrilegious to suggest that He did not belong to Jeket. Here, His golden skin is smooth and His body featureless. His face is round, alive, and enlightened. His pose is rigid as a board, as if someone who had never sat before had the act described to them in a dream. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to reality. It was more primitive and therefore more true. And it was huge, at least ten feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.
It was a beautiful sight. No doubt the source of Mandri’s newfound serenity. None of it glittered as brightly as Mandrameen might have wanted, for a thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash had speckled His cheek. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. But what could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen’s golden skin darkly mottled, tarnished.
Mandri winced at such impiety. Pure gold cannot tarnish, and so this meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals. No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their suffering. And worse—standing by Solraheen’s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine. Now, he could not say for certain what this urine was for, but there was a narrative proximity here which couldn’t be ignored. Surely—surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.
One indignity to wash away another.
“They should have settled for a smaller statue,” Mandri mumbled.
“What’s that?” croaked Elrahet.
Mandri pointed to the statue. “It’s tarnished,” he said.
“What of it?”
“It’s not pure gold.”
“Oh, swogglebottom. The good Lord does not care about gold. What He really cares about is this man here,” she poked the dead man again with her cane, “And that poor thing there.” She pointed with the torch to a dark lump sitting not ten feet away from Mandri. 
Mandri jump back and gasped. The round lump lurking in the shadows had an ear. It had a mop of dark hair. It was the back of a severed head. A few links of its vertebral column were still attached. What flesh there was looked like it had been gnawed on.
“The Mazyd was right,” said Elrahet. “Though it wasn’t hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.”
Mandri . He said, “Are you saying that this green robe guy ate that other guy over there?” 
Elrahet nodded. “It was his final meal.”
“Ok, we’re leaving,” said Moto.
“No,” said Elrahet. “The struggle in this room is over.”
“We should burn it.”
“Nonsense. This was one of Solraheen’s champions. Don’t be so quick to judge those touched by the darkness, for there is no greater struggle. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it took him completely. See here… he was growing horns.”
She turned the man’s chin upright with the tip of her cane, and sure enough, there were two fleshy nubs protruding from his forehead. His jaw lolled open, and a too-long tongue unfurled onto the floor.
“If he had lost his battle, this world’s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand.”
She held the torch low to the firepit, and she poked around it with her cane to reveal, half buried in ash, a round stomach still full with that final meal. The green-robed man had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it the intestines behind, and these he’d cut too and tossed into the ash. The stomach was black, nearly as black as Fabled Black, and while that might be expected for flesh cooking in flames, it seemed to Mandri that it was black for other reasons. If the torchlight was truthful, the stomach was still wet and still subtly pumping.
Elrahet pulled out her golden knife and cut the stomach open without effort. She opened the halves with tip of her cane as if to divine it.
Now, divination is an art of which Mandri knew very little. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ is subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance—there’s the stomach’s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the meaning of current events but predict the future. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach, that he would understand anything about what was going on. But when that stomach snapped open, the stomach itself let loose a black puff of smoke that struck Mandri dumb with dread.
He was not the only one. All present shuddered and gasped.
“Oooookay,” said Moto. “We’re not waiting in here.”
Elrahet ignored him. With her blade she sorted through the stomach’s contents. Her sullen face was fraught with worry. 
“Did you not hear me? I said we’re leaving.”
“Don’t have to tell me twice,” said Seb, and he scuttled out the door.
“Evidently I do,” Moto said derisively. But no one else had budged.
“Elrahet,” he said, “Please just do what I ask you to do.”
Elrahet snapped and said, “Go look for Ayram.”
Moto’s shoulders sank. He looked despondently up at the ceiling, and tried to rub the frustration out of his forehead. Then he clapped his hands, and said, “Alright. Alllllright. If a demon falls down from the ceiling and starts making your insides be outsides, don’t complain to me.”
  He threw his pack down, pulled from it a rock crystal spyglass and hurried out into the oncoming night to watch for Ayram’s coming.
Elrahet shouted after him like a worried mother.
“Don’t stray too far!”
And like every son with his own ideas, Moto ignored her.
Mandri decided to follow him, because the divination of entrails was not for him. He set his Obo-stuffed pack against an ash-brushed column, and joined Moto as well as Seb outside on the temple’s doorstep. 
The evening breeze was a revelation, it told of just how foul the air in that hall really was. Mandri took a deep breath of it, hoping to clear the taint of that vile stomach from his senses. He thought he could still smell it. He could certainly still see it in his mind’s eye, and now that he was thinking about it he wanted to vomit.
 He grimaced and thought of prettier things. The sun was now a bright pink line in the west and that pinkness washed over a smattering of faint stars who were just beginning to twinkle. The fractured face of the plateau below nearly mirrored the color of the sky. All this would have been enough to drag Mandri’s thoughts away from that black and belching stomach, but Seb was sitting at the head of Shulgi’s stairs, sitting on top of his pack with that dead Riga child still bundled to it, and the man was slurping and chewing his borcandi spines with unusual ferocity.
“How many of those spines do you have?” Mandri asked him. “You’ve been chewing them nonstop since I met you.”
Seb puckered his lips and sent a wad of spit flying down the stairs. He watched it until it disappeared, then said, “I chew ‘em till there ain’t nothin’ left. A single spine goes a day. Seven a week. Got a hundred and two left.” He gave his pack a few hearty slaps and the Riga’s head juddered.
“I know you took a burgeon,” he said.
“A burgeon? What are you talking about?”
“Uh-huh.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“You see anythin’ special?”
Mandri turned and looked for Moto. The man had climbed up above Shulgi’s entrance arch. He was sitting sideways in the circle of the viper’s eye, scanning the distance for Ayram.
Seb said, “I can see the Hrks.”
“Where?” Mandri asked.
“You must be blind, ‘cause I’m half-blind an’ I can see ‘em.”
He pointed out to the cracked expanse again. Mandri expected to see a white line marching out on top of it. Then he saw a faint orange glow flickering in one of the distant cracks. In fact there were two bright spots, glowing, one further back, seemingly stuck and not moving, and one maybe halfway out, wandering in the wrong direction. Outside of these two blooms of light, the canyon curves were many times blacker than the night that was creeping in. Trying to find Ayram in them would, no doubt, be a hopeless endeavor. 
Mandri asked Seb, “Ayram’s not going to fight them all, is he?”
Seb spat again, and lubricated his lips with his tongue before speaking. 
“He’s layin’ a false trail,” he said. “Helpin’ the Hrks get turned around in them canyons is be easy to do, ‘specially at night. Lots of places to get lost. Ya know they don’t call it the Shattered Plateau for nothin’. Its got doublin’ back places, sideways places, and whatnot. Hard to just keep goin’ straight.”
“Where is he?”
“You’d have to have the eyes of a bat to find Ayram in those canyons.” 
Moto voice called out from behind, “I see him!”
“That was quick.”
Mandri looked down at the crack that led up Shulgi, half-expecting to see Ayram charging out of it and leaping up the steps, but he wasn’t there nor anywhere else. Mandri scanned up and down all the cracks that weren’t so obscured by canyon curves, but he saw nothing. 
“He’s so god-damned fast,” Moto declared as he rolled his disbelief, jealousy, and admiration into a sigh. This was, Mandri supposed, the closest Moto could come to actually expressing something resembling respect. It made Mandri want to find Ayram all the more. He realized he’d never actually seen the giant sprinting. Ayram doing anything was a physical feat, he could be taking a shit and Mandri would want front row seating.
Still, he saw nothing.
Moto said, “If I didn't know better, I'd say that he's spooked.”
Seb twisted around and said to Moto, “What makes you say you know better?”
“It's Ayram. The man doesn't get spooked.”
Mandri, eager to be included, said, “I don’t see him. Where is he?”
Seb pretended to wonder if Mandri was blind, then pointed out at the shattered plateau, and said, “He’s right there.”
“I don’t see—oh.”
The reason Mandri hadn’t seen Ayram is because Ayram wasn’t weaving his way through the dark canyons, he was out on top of the plateau, looking a bit like a flea on the back of a scaled lizard hide. He was sprinting towards the temple, leaping across the canyon gaps as he went. Some of these gaps were larger than Mandri thought was possible to traverse, but as Ayram jumped, he stabbed the ground with spear and practically threw himself across. The speed and power was incredible, even viewed so far away. 
“Shit!” Moto yelled. He clambered out of the snakes eye, and when the distance was manageable, he jumped down. His eyes were alight with worry. He grabbed Mandri under the arm and said, “Get inside.”
“What is it?”
“Damn it, get inside!”
He threw Mandri back towards the temple and started to manhandle Seb.
Seb shook his arm free from Moto’s grip. “What’re you on about?”
“Do not argue with me, Seb. Get inside, or I’ll make you.”
“What’s got you so—”
Moto grabbed Seb’s shoulder and lifted him up. Seb, being the much smaller man, didn’t fight it, though he did make it as hard as he could letting his heels drag. Moto dragged him right past Mandri, gave him a look that could boil bone.
“If you don’t get your ass inside…” he said, and he left Mandri to imagine the details.
Mandri ran after him, but took one last look out at the shattered plateau. Ayram was still hurtling towards the temple. He was rapidly approaching a crevasse that would, surely, be too wide for even him to jump. 
He didn’t slow down.
“No way,” Mandri muttered.
Afore the gap, Ayram’s stride lengthened into a bounding skip—one, two, three—his fourth step pressed off the edge of the crevasse, and he launched himself into the air. His momentum was incredible.
Suddenly, from out towards the pass, a thin beam of golden fire exploded into the night, zipping right towards Ayram. It rushed at the speed of a lightning flash, and so brilliant was its light that Mandri couldn’t help but blink.
When he opened his eyes, Ayram was gone. A cloud of dust swirled in his wake. A long black scorch mark scarred his landing zone.
Moto’s hand grabbed the neck of Mandri’s robe and pulled him into the temple, and without so much as a word of warning, Moto dropped him on the floor.
“What was that?” Moteah asked. She had seen the flash but not the source.
Moto shouldered his pack and said, simply, “Mazydfire”.
“How close?”
Moto did not answer. He marched through the hall and stopped next to Elrahet. He asked her, brusquely, “Where to?”</Text>

            <Text>After the well, they came to a natron flat two miles long and as many wide. Seb broke off small chunks of the white stuff and rubbed it on his few remaining teeth. He said it had medicinal properties. Mandri knew it for its use in pigments.

            <Text>“I’m going to smuggle you into caves underneath Jeket.”
“That will be difficult.”
“When we reach the caves, we’re going to march our way into Solraheen’s chamber, and you’re going to use your Mazidfire to free him from underneath the stone of Fabled Black.” Ayram’s voice was cold and direct, as if he hadn’t just said the most absurd thing imaginable.
“I’m sorry,” said Obo. “Is there some Hrkan Lord who has taken to calling himself Solraheen?”
“There is only one Solraheen.”

Ayram leaned on his iron rod and said, “I am quite serious. You are going to free Solraheen.”
“Why? I only ask because trying to undo Solraheen’s sacrifice might be counterproductive to your desired ends.”
“It is not.”


Obo squinted in disbelief. “But why?” he asked. “Let’s say you do free Him. Are you expecting He’ll look down at you, a mortal, and not smite you for nullifying His sacrificial will?”
“I don’t need to justify myself to you.”
“Why are you so certain that Mazidfire will cut through Fabled Black?”
“I am not,” said Ayram. “Still, I wish to try.”
“You know that if you free Solraheen, then you’ll have freed Schisol as well? Or is that what your real goal is?”

I would even betray Solraheen.

“I understand your concern,” said Obo. “Solraheen gave humanity a Spark, and now you set out to repay that kindness by betraying Him. You’re worried I’ll get the same idea.”
“Why wouldn’t you?” Elrahet spat.

“There is one other option,” Obo blurted out. “Actually, this solution was in your grasp just now, but true to form, you’ve managed to squander the opportunity.”
“Out with it.”
“You could capture a Riga after it has disabled me, then you could walk right into Jeket with both our bodies unmolested. Then, standing before Solraheen, you could reanimate me as you’ve done just now, then carry on with your act of defilement.”
Seb stood up and said, “Wait a finger—are you saying that we could have—”
Ayram waved Seb off and said, “We’d have to keep the Riga alive. We’d have to carry it all the way to Jeket. We’d be trading smuggling you for smuggling a Riga child. It’s one problem for another.”
“I suspect,” said Obo, “That the Mazidariga are not capable of tracking each other the way they can track us Mazidai. And I’m not certain of it, but it stands to reason that they cannot track my pseudospark if it is not actively willing limbs into motion.”
Seb spoke up again. By now he’d almost reached the conversation. “So we could have walked right into the Jeket if we hadn’t just—”
Ayram cut Seb short a third time, and the grim look on his face told Seb that if he had to shut him up a fourth time, it would come at a cost.
Obo answered Seb’s question anyway. 
“Yes, if you had waited to revive me, you could have walked straight to Jeket without a worry.”
“It’s no matter,” Ayram grunted. “If we captured a Riga once, we can do it again.”
Obo tilted his head as if he hadn’t quite heard right. “I’m not confident that you can afford another Minting Rock.”
“You didn’t think we could afford the first one.”
“That’s a fair point, but even if you have a small army of Ayramun hiding somewhere, that still won’t be enough to stand up to what’s coming.”</Text>

            <Title>Quick!</Title>
            <Text>The moment was perfect.
Lorba Bargu had her nice, cozy rocking chair she’d built out of a bent and sanded gabbu tree she grew from a seed. She had her nice, heavy blue blanket that her loving husband Kam had knit out of the softest wool. The silver sky was pleasant, with the rain tap-tapping on the clay-shingles of her master’s wagon house, which was better described as a sheltered porch adjoining her master’s western wall. It was not a grand shelter, though it offered a grand view, advantaged, as it was, at the top of Meskalim's central hill looking west, with the sprawling mud-city spread out below and the foggy, Shalbrum Sea boiling beyond it.
The moment’s only discordant note was her blistered heels, for she was still wearing in the stiff leather boots made two days before by her son, who was a cobbler’s apprentice. This slight pain was a beauty mark, an ugliness which when juxtaposed against perfection enhanced it.
Yes, the moment was perfect.
Almost perfect.
Unfortunately, her wagon’s bed was full-up with the half-dead bodies of artists. She knew they were artists, because when her master carried them out of the great house they had paint on their fingers and clothes, usually black paint. And she knew they were only half-dead instead of full-dead, because after killing them, her master brought them out to her wagon house to administer a rainbow potion which, he claimed, ‘stabilized the Spark’. Her master kept this potion hidden in a false drawer in her workbench. Lorba never touched this hidden treasure. She wanted nothing to do with it. She only ever watched when her master would force a few drops of that shimmering liquid down into the corpse’s mouth, and she didn’t help when he sat the the poor wretches up and shook them to make sure the liquid was running fast down into the stomach. To her, this habit of her master’s was an eccentricity she could forgive for the sake of the job, for the sake of these moments where she could sit high up, rock back-and-forth, and feel comfortable, secure, even delight at how her life had turned out.

“You think his Spark has faded?”
Salavan shook his fat head. He nodded towards the wagon and said, “Stuff him in with the others.”


 wagon house, it was Salavan’s, but it was as good as his. Thanked the dead god Solraheen for planning all this for him. Cart laden with dead bodies, each of them artists, but that was not his concern.  for the pittering rain as the evening sun. Thankful for the high vantage point over, rut of habit. 
“Quick!”  “Bring the shit! Before his Spark fades!”
Carries the body.

Now that that was over.
This did nothing to quell his master’s immediate needs. The big man picked the dead boy up, and rushed out the into the rain. He never let his good silk robes get wet.
He stopped and shouted, “Lorba, you idiot! Come!”

“Fetch 
Pour purfume and shit The mazid can smell
Lower compartment. 

“Why are we in such a hurry?”
The Minder and his Mazid leave tonight. So you must leave tonight!
But the weather. The wagon will get all chewed up.
Salavan took close to his eyes. 
She wanted to point out that sending out a wagon that’s supposed to draw dry would kill it. She couldn’t do that. She was as proud of this wagon as she was of her son—it was just as clean and sturdy, and both she’d built herself. If she were to draw it in the rain, the water would swell the wheels against the shrunk-on iron tire. When the wheel eventually dries out, it will crack, and cracks mean gaps for the sand to enter. Sand will willow its way into the wax-greased innards of the hubs and grind against the bronze bushings. She needed time to take prophylactic measures to guard against this inevitability.
Salavan knew what she thinking.
“Damn your wagon, woman! If you don’t stick this goddamn wagon on the end of that column, then by Schisol’s shadow, I will add you to back of this cart!”
Lorba gulped.
“Now go!”
The winding route down to the bottom of Meskalim’s hill was always. 
At the bottom the Hrkan troops were, all of them unusually shrouded in brown robes. 
Lorba called out to the captain.
“I have orders from the governor.”
“What orders?”
“I’m to attach myself to the column.”
The captain took the paper from from Lorba’s hand and 
How dare he talk like this. I am a scribe! My luck I should put under him. Guild of Lords  has lost it.

I have a writ from the governor, Salavan Soreen, third rank in the guild of Lords.
Hrkan captain. Very well.

            <Title>James the Just</Title>
            <Text>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clementine_literature

Hegelian philosopher and theologian Ferdinand Christian Baur, the founder of the Tübingen School of New Testament Higher criticism, based some of his theories about the New Testament on the Clementines. In turn, his ideas about the Clementines were based on descriptions by St. Epiphanius of Salamis (c. 310–320 – 403), regarding the beliefs and writings of Christian Ebionites in the 4th century. This Judeo-Christian sect, which thought themselves to be the authentic remnant of the earliest disciples of Jesus, rejected St. Paul as both a false apostle of Christ and an apostate from Torah-observant Judaism. Ebionites asserted that their position also represented the Christianity of the Twelve Apostles. &quot;Paulinism&quot;, asserting salvation by faith without works of the law, was thus regarded as a heresy. This Pauline gospel thus caused a schism from the authentic apostolic Jewish Christianity originally headed by James, brother of Jesus and Saint Peter. Baur held that the Clementine references to the notorious Samaritan sorcerer Simon Magus (see Acts 8:9–24) were actually covert polemics against Paul. In Baur's historical theory, Catholicism resulted from the eventual accommodation necessitated between the Petrine and Pauline factions of the Church, beginning in the late 2nd century. The tradition that Peter and Paul co-founded Rome's Church in the mid-1st-century and were martyred together, is regarded as a fiction. 


Throughout the middle of the 19th century this theory, in many forms, was dominant in Germany. The demonstration, mainly by English scholars, of the impossibility of the late dates ascribed to the New Testament documents[citation needed] (four Epistles of St. Paul and the Apocalypse were the only documents generally admitted as being of early date), and the proofs of the authenticity of the Apostolic Fathers and of the use of St. John's Gospel by Justin, Papias, and Ignatius gradually brought Baur's theories into discredit. Of the original school, Adolf Hilgenfeld may be considered the last survivor (died 1907). He was induced many years ago to admit that Simon Magus was a real personage, though he persists that in the Clementines he is meant for St. Paul. To a priori critics it counts as nothing that Simon holds no Pauline doctrine and that the author shows no signs of being a Judæo-Christian. In 1847 Hilgenfeld dated the original nucleus (Kerygmata Petrou) soon after the Jewish war of 70; successive revisions of it were anti-Basilidian, anti-Valentinian, and anti-Marcionite respectively. Baur placed the completed form, H, soon after the middle of the 2nd century, and Schliemann (1844) agreed, placing R, as a revision, between 211 and 230. Other writers dated both H and R to between the 2nd and 4th centuries: 


Josep Rius-Camps[8] called the fragment Rec I, 27-74 'History of Salvation' (HS) and proposed its belonging to the B or Original Writing, quite ancient. Rius-Camps' study, however, does not grant to the first part of HS (Rec I, 27-42) the antiquity and independence that practically all researchers accept (although few agree on the limits of the ancient source). Most scholars[9][10][11] date (Rec I, 27-74) it after Hadrian although a minority (Bardsley, Thomas, Cullmann)[12][13][14] date it around the year 100 in the interwar period. Pedro Giménez De Aragón Sierra considers that must have been written between 96 and 116.[15] 

Regarding the claim of HS is not to proclaim the end of the Torah, but to make the Jews see that they can remain Jews by renouncing the sacrifices[a] and admitting the messianic character of Jesus. With respect to the Gentiles, their goal was to reinterpret the Torah to make it more acceptable to the Gentiles. In the cross-cultural process of constructing the Roman identity, the Judeo-Christians of HS wanted to participate by Judaizing the Empire, for which they yielded a little in their Jewish beliefs, making them more lax. However, it would not be of special interest to the Christian gentiles because they had found other more adequate versions to engender that ideological syncretism between Greco-Roman paganism and Judaism that was the triumphant Christianity. Those other triumphant versions are those of Luke, Paul, Barnabas, Mark and many others who, without rejecting the Torah, the Prophets and the historical books (i.e. the Old Testament), relativized them through the superiority of a series of scriptures that emerged precisely in the same interwar period in which HS was written (Gospels, Acts, epistles). Even if the ideology of HS was closer to the primitive ideology of the followers of Jesus, that did not make it more suitable than these other scriptures for the world that was being built.[16] 

Our Lord and Prophet, who has sent us, declared to us that the Evil One, having disputed with him forty days, but failing to prevail against him, promised He would send Apostles from among his subjects to deceive them. Therefore, above all, remember to shun any Apostle, teacher, or prophet who does not accurately compare his teaching with [that of] James ... the brother of my Lord... and this, even if he comes to you with recommendations. Pseudoclementine Homilies 11.35 (Peter preaching at Tripoli) 



Embarrassment of this kind was exacerbated by the fact that Jesus’ brothers (‘cousins’, as Jerome would later come to see them at the end of the fourth century) were the principal personages in Palestine and Jesus’ successors there, important in Eastern tradition generally. What exacerbated the problem of their relationship to Jesus even further in the second century was the theological assertion of Mary’s ‘perpetual virginity’ and with it the utter impossibility - nay, inconceivability - that she should have had other children. This even led Jerome’s younger contemporary, Augustine, in the fifth century, to the assertion reproduced in Muhammad’s Koran in the seventh, that Jesus didn’t have any father at all, only a mother! 

To the ideologue, it was simply impossible that Jesus should have had a father or brothers, Gospel notices and references in Paul notwithstanding. Nor could Joseph have had any children by Mary. These had to have been by another wife. All such theological considerations will be set aside and all family designations treated naturally. If a person was said to have had a brother, then he was a natural brother, conceived by natural generation, not a half-brother, stepbrother, ‘cousin’, or ‘milk brother’. 

The wealth of extra-biblical sources relating to James has already been noted. If we include with these those in the Book of Acts, where not adulterated or retrospectively overwritten with more orthodox historical or theological materials, and notices in the letters of Paul, then there is a considerable amount of material relating to James. James is also mentioned in the Gospels, but here the material is marred by doctrinal attempts either to defame the family and brothers of Jesus or to disqualify them in some manner. 

The same can be said for Paul’s letters, which provide additional straightforward witness to ‘James the brother of the Lord’ and know no other James. The Historical James can also be reconstructed from the underlying circumstances to which remarks in these letters are directed. These, plus a myriad of extra-biblical materials, such as Josephus, apocryphal gospels, non-canonical acts including the ‘Pseudo-’ or ‘False Clementines’, the Gnostic manuscripts from Nag Hammadi in Upper Egypt, and the mass of early Church literature all constitute sources about James. The documentation is that impressive. If we include in this mix of materials the Righteous Teacher found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, where the commonality of language, themes, and historical setting provide additional correspondences, then we are truly in a position of some strength with regard to James. 

Who would have known the character Jesus better? His closest living relatives, who according to tradition were his legitimate successors in Palestine, and those companions accompanying him in all his activities? Or someone who admits that he never saw Jesus in his lifetime, as Paul does, and that, on the contrary, he was an Enemy of and persecuted the early Christian community, and came to know him only through visionary experiences that allowed him to be in touch with a figure he designates as ‘Christ Jesus’ in Heaven? The answer of any reasonable observer to this question should be obvious: James and Jesus’ Palestinian companions. But the answer of all orthodox Church circles has always been that Paul’s understanding of Jesus was superior and that he knew him better than any of Jesus’ other Apostles or companions. Furthermore, it is claimed that the doctrines represented by James and the members of Jesus’ family generally were defective in their understanding of Paul’s Christ Jesus and inferior to boot. Given the fact that the Christianity we are heirs to is largely the legacy of Paul and like-minded persons, this is just what one would have expected and it should surprise no one. 

This is particularly evident in the picture of the Apostles in the Gospels as ‘weak’ (Matt. 14:31 and pars.), a term Paul repeatedly uses in his letters, almost always with derogatory intent, when describing the leaders of the community, particularly in Jerusalem, and their directives (Rom. 14:1-2 and 1 Cor. 8:7-9:22). Occasionally he parodies this, applying the term to himself to gain sympathy, but generally he uses it to attack the leadership, in particular those keeping dietary regulations or relying on Mosaic Law - even those whom, as he puts it, ‘only eat vegetables’, like James. 


In the Gospels, reflecting Paul, when an Apostle as important as Peter ‘sinks’ into the Sea of Galilee for lack of ‘Faith’ or denies Jesus three times on his death night, the implications are quite clear. They are ‘weak’ in their adherence to the Pauline concept of ‘Faith’, as opposed to the more Jamesian one of salvation by ‘works’. In addition, they have a defective understanding of Jesus’ teaching, particularly of that most important of all Pauline doctrines, the Christ. This is the situation that has retrospectively been confirmed by eighteen hundred years of subsequent Church history too - however unreasonable or in defiance of real history it might appear 


It was Plato, who, comprehending the nature of the ancient world better than many others, wished to banish the poets from his ‘Republic’ or ideal state - not without cause, because, in his view, it was the poets who created the myths and religious mysteries, by which the less critically minded lived. For Plato, this was a world of almost total darkness 

It will transpire that the person of James is almost diametrically opposed to the Jesus of Scripture and our ordinary understanding of him. Whereas the Jesus of Scripture is antinationalist, cosmopolitan, antinomian - that is, against the direct application of Jewish Law - and accepting of foreigners and other persons of perceived impurities, the Historical James will turn out to be zealous for the Law, xenophobic, rejecting of foreigners and polluted persons generally, and apocalyptic. 

Strong parallels emerge between these kinds of attitudes and those of the Righteous Teacher in the Dead Sea Scrolls. For instance, attitudes in the Gospels towards many classes of persons - tax collectors, harlots, Sinners, and the like - are diametrically opposed to those delineated in the Dead Sea Scrolls, but in agreement with anti-Semitic diatribes of the time in Greco-Hellenistic environments such as Caesarea and Alexandria. 

At the centre of the agitation in the Temple in the mid-50s, hostile to Herodians, Romans, and their fellow travellers, James will emerge as the pivotal figure among the more nationalist-inclining crowd. In his incarnation of ‘the Perfect Righteous’ or ‘Just One’, he will be at the centre of the Opposition Alliance of sects and revolutionary groups opposed to the Pharisaic/Sadducean Establishment, pictured in Josephus and the New Testament. 


Paul, on the other hand, will emerge as a highly compromised individual, deeply involved with Roman officials and Herodian kings - a proposition given added weight by the intriguing allusions to a parallel character in the Dead Sea Scrolls called ‘the Lying Spouter’ or ‘Scoffer’ — even to the extent of actually being a member of the family of King Herod. 

His contacts will go very high indeed, even into the Emperor Nero’s personal household itself (Phil. 4:22). Appreciating this context will help rescue Jesus’ closest relatives and his religious and political heirs in Palestine from the oblivion into which they have been cast either intentionally or via benign neglect. Coming at this juncture in the debate over the relationship of the Dead Sea Scrolls to Christianity, these kinds of insights should prove enlightening. 

Martin Luther a thousand years later felt that the Letter of James should not have been included in the New Testament at all.3 

If we widen this interpretation somewhat to include the Eastern sectarian tendency, referred to in early Church literature as ‘Ebionite’ and deriving from an original Hebrew root meaning ‘the Poor’, and other parallel currents producing additional variations related to it, like the Essenes, Nazoraeans, Elchasaites, Manichaeans, and even Islam, we discover a different story. For its part, the Letter of James in its essence resembles nothing so much as the Dead Sea Scrolls, which is why, prior to their discovery, it may have been difficult to appreciate this. 


Sects such as these were at a very early time pronounced anathema by the Rabbis - the heirs of the Pharisees pictured in the New Testament - who took over Judaism by default seven and a half years after James’ judicial murder. After the destruction of the Temple theirs was the only Jewish tradition the Romans were willing to tolerate in Palestine. The legal tradition they inherited has come to be known as Halachah, the sum total of religious law according to the traditions of the Pharisees. It is preserved in the literature of the Rabbis known as the Talmud. This includes what is also known as ‘the Oral Law’ and consists mainly of a document compiled in the third century called the Mishnah, a number of commentaries on it, and further traditional compilations, together known as either the ‘Babylonian’ or ‘Jerusalem Talmud’, depending on whether they originated in Iraq or Palestine. 

The Movement headed by James from the 40s to the 60s CE in Jerusalem was the principal one of a number of groups categorized in the Talmud by the pejorative terminology min or minim (plural). This has now come to mean in Jewish tradition ‘sectarian’. With the gradual production of this rabbinical literature - at the time of Jesus there were sectarian leaders who went under the title ‘Rabbi’ as well - a new form of Judaism was formulated no longer predicated on the Temple. This became dominant in Palestine only after the Romans imposed it by brute force. 

Because of its palpably more accommodating attitude towards foreign rule and, at least while the Temple was still standing, to High Priests appointed by foreigners or foreigncontrolled rulers, it was really the only form of Jewish religious expression the Romans were willing to live with. The same was to hold true for the form of Christianity we can refer to as ‘Pauline’, which was equally submissive or accommodating to Roman power. For his part, Paul proudly proclaimed his Pharisaic roots (Phil. 3:5). 

This form of Judaism must be distinguished from the more variegated tapestry that characterized Jewish religious expression in Jesus’ and James’ lifetimes. This consisted of quite a number of groups before the fall of the Temple, some of which were quite militant and aggressive, even apocalyptic, that is, having a concern for a highly emotive style of expression regarding ‘the End Time’. Most of these apocalyptic groups focused in one way or another on the Temple. They were written out of Judaism in the same manner that James and Jesus’ other brothers were written out of Christianity. 

Eusebius, who came from Caesarea in Palestine, was Constantine’s bishop and personal confidant. He had a major role in the organization and guidance of the Council of Nicea. The development of this genre of Overseas Christianity was actually concurrent and parallel to the development of Rabbinic Judaism - if something of its mirror image. Both were not only willing to live with Roman power, they owed their continued existence to its sponsorship. 

To put this proposition differently: the fact of the power and brutality of Rome was operating in both to drive out and to declare heretical what is now called Jewish Christianity - ‘Essenism’ or ‘Ebionitism’ would perhaps be a better description of it in Palestine. In Judaism, what was left was a legalistic shadow of former glories, bereft of apocalyptic and Messianic tendencies; in Christianity, a largely Hellenized, other-worldly mystery cult, the real religious legacy of three hundred years of Roman religious genius and assimilation. This surgery was necessary if Christianity in the form we know it was to survive, since certain doctrines represented by James, and probably dating back to his Messianic predecessor ‘Jesus’, were distinctly opposed to those ultimately considered to be Christian. 

Of all the characters in the early stages of Christianity, Paul alone is known to us through reliable, first-hand autobiographical documents, that is, the letters attributed to him in the New Testament. They reveal his life, character and thought in the most personal manner possible. All others, even Jesus and most of those generally called ‘Apostles’, we know only by second- or third-hand accounts, if we know them at all. We have Gospels or letters purportedly written about them or in their names, but these must be handled with the utmost care. 

Paul’s letters and a few other materials - possibly including the Letter of James - come first and are primary. The rest come later and are secondary. The Gospels themselves are probably even tertiary. Biblical scholars have not come to a consensus on which aspects of this legacy can properly be considered historical. Nor have they succeeded in giving us, despite the bulk of their output, a very real picture of what might have occurred at this formative moment in human history or of the events surrounding and succeeding the life of the individual called, in the Hellenistic world, ‘the Christ’. 

In Roman Catholic doctrine it has been the received teaching since the end of the fourth century that James was the brother of Jesus, not only by a different father, an obvious necessity in view of the doctrine of divine sonship, but also by a different mother - the answer to the conundrum presented by the perpetual virginity of Mary. That is, James was a ‘cousin’ of Jesus. 

At some point in the mid-40s, Cephas and John, two of those Paul designates as ‘Pillars’ in Galatians 2:9,10 along with another James, ‘the brother of John’ as distinct from James the subject of this book, disappear from the scene, probably in the context of conflict with Herodian kings such as Agrippa I (37 — 44 CE) or his brother Herod of Chalcis (44-49 CE). Thus, James was left to occupy the ‘Christian’ leadership stage in Palestine alone for the next two decades. At least this is what can be gleaned from the materials in Acts, however imprecise or mythologized they may be. 

there are lost resurrection traditions that accorded precedence even in this to James, despite attempts to obliterate them. One of these, found in the first postresurrection appearance episode in the Gospel of Luke, depicts Jesus as appearing to ‘Clopas’ — that is, Simeon bar Cleophas or his father - together with another unnamed companion, possibly James, on the Emmaus road outside Jerusalem. A second is certainly to be found in 1 Corinthians 15:7, where Paul confirms an appearance to James and ‘last of all’ himself 

In the former at least, if not in the latter, we have unassailable evidence of a tradition according precedence in the matter of the first appearance to a member or members of Jesus’ family — ‘Clopas’, according to extant tradition, being, at the very least, Jesus’ uncle. Interestingly enough, this appearance takes place in the environs of Jerusalem, not in Galilee as most other such Gospel renditions. 

In addition, other early traditions, reflected to a certain extent in the Gospel of Thomas found at Nag Hammadi and in the Pseudoclementines — Hellenistic romances paralleling Acts, but from a Judeo-Christian point of view - actually speak in terms of a direct appointment of James by Jesus.13 As opposed to this, early Church traditions via Clement of Alexandria (150-215), reported by Eusebius, not insignificantly, speak of an election of James or an election by the Apostles. Whatever the conclusion, there can be no doubt that James was the actual successor in Palestine, if not elsewhere. 

Finally, there is the Letter ascribed to James in the New Testament, which Eusebius considers spurious. Despite its Jewish apocalyptic character and in spite of its purportedly late appearance on the scene, it was evidently imbued with such prestige that it could not be excluded from the canon. It can be shown to be a direct riposte to points Paul makes in his Letters to the Romans, Corinthians, and Galatians. Even if this is not sufficient to consider it authentic, its doctrines are enough like those of the Historical James, reconstructable from other sources, to contend that, at the very least, it represents authentic Palestinian tradition. 

Despite its relatively polished Greek style, the antiquity of its materials can also now be confirmed by reference to its many parallels to doctrines in the Dead Sea Scrolls, not available previously. It also lacks the Gnostic tendencies so prevalent in later documents featuring the person of James. In it, too, the Temple would seem to be still standing and the catastrophe that was soon to overwhelm Jewish life in Palestine has seemingly not yet occurred. 

It was around this Perfectly Holy and Righteous ‘Just One’ in the Temple that in our view all parties opposing the Herodian/Roman Establishment, from the more violent and extreme to the less so, ranged. In this role as Bishop, James was also High Priest of the Opposition Alliance - thus, in effect, the Opposition High Priest. This is the role accorded him in early Church tradition as well and, as such, it is more or less equivalent to the individual dubbed, in Qumran usage, ‘the Mebakker’ or ‘Overseer’ and/or ‘the High Priest Commanding the Many’.15 This role is accorded the Teacher of Righteousness at Qumran as well. 

Ultimately we shall place James at the centre of the Opposition Alliance of all the groups and parties opposing foreign rule in Palestine and its concomitant, foreign gifts and sacrifices on behalf of foreigners in the Temple. The opposition of this Alliance to Herodian Kings and the Herodian Priesthood led directly to the Uprising against Rome. 

This forms the mirror image of the way Christian tradition portrays the Messianic individuals it approves of, who are pictured as sympathetic - or at least not antipathetic - to Rome. This kind of inversion will be shown to be a consistent aspect of the portraiture and polemics of this period. To rescue James from the obscurity into which he was cast, we should now turn to the history of Palestine preceding him, which set the stage for his life, as well as to a description of those sources on which our information about him is based. 

After the destruction of the First Temple, tradition describes an interregnum of some forty-five years - the Babylonian Captivity - when members of the upper classes were under enforced sojourn in Babylon. The building of the new Second Temple, which followed their return, proceeded in stages, taking approximately another hundred years to complete. Primitive rebuilding efforts, as commanded by the Persian King Cyrus in 540 BC (Isaiah 44:28), began almost immediately under a scion of the previous royal line, Zerubbabel — that is, ‘shoot’ of David or Jesse out of Babylon (Babel meaning ‘Babylon’). He was accompanied by a priestly individual, Jesus ben Yehozedek, presumably the son of the previous reigning High Priest, Yehozedek. Both names have important ramifications for our period, the second meaning ‘God justifies’ or ‘God’s Righteousness’. A leadership conjunction of priestly and royal individuals such as this is important for the Qumran Scrolls, as it is for the New Testament Letter to the Hebrews.1 What became of the organizational and building efforts of th 

What became of the organizational and building efforts of this first royal and High Priestly pair is unclear. At some point the Davidic part of the constellation seems to have dropped out, leaving only priests in the Persian manner in a kind of local autonomy. Some even think that the famous ‘Suffering Servant’ passages in the second part of Isaiah - called by scholars ‘Deutero’ or ‘Second Isaiah’ - have to do with the kingly part of this ruling dichotomy having come to a bad end. This would not be surprising in view of the political turmoil of the time 

Except for a genealogical list in 1 Chronicles 3:24, which ends a little before the beginning of the Maccabean period, nothing further is heard of Zerubbabel or his descendants, representing the Davidic or kingly part of this duality, that is, until the rise of various movements in the first century under the Messianic leaders of that time, leading to the destruction of Jerusalem and the Second Temple. It is interesting that the last descendant of Zerubabbel in 1 Chronicles above is someone called ‘Anani’ — in Hebrew meaning ‘Cloudy One’ — an allusion with overtones, when considering the all-important Messianic citation about the ‘Son of Man coming on the clouds of Heaven’ from Daniel 7:13. Zerubbabel crops up as well in New Testament genealogies of Jesus, but neither Matthew nor Luke, who present differing versions of these genealogies, agrees with his genealogy in Chronicles.2 Julius Africanus (170-245 CE), an early Church father, also dealt with the issue of these genealogies, claiming that so jealous was Herod of the genealogies of others that he burned all genealogical records in his own time so no one could possess one superior to his own.3

The mention of Zadok and Yehozedek is important, because the root on which this noun cluster is based, the three Hebrew letters Z-D-K, bears the meaning of ‘Righteousness’. This is not only the basis for James’ cognomen, ‘the Righteous’ or ‘Just One’, according to all early Church sources, but it is connected to the name of one of the sects in Jesus’ time, which transliterates into Greek, Sadducee or Zadduki/Zaddoki. In Hebrew, ee or i is a suffix referring to a person who is or does a thing, in this case, a ‘Zadok’ or a ‘Zaddik’, the latter meaning in English ‘Righteous One’ 

When this Zadduki or Sadducee terminology actually emerges is not clear, but by the first century CE, Josephus is referring to priests in his own time as trying to claim descent from David’s High Priest Zadok. Some of these claims even he does not entertain.7 Jewish Talmudic literature (dating from the third to the seventh century CE) presents a similar picture, but extends the term Sadducee using it as a pejorative inclusive of all sectarians. 

Whatever else this something is, it certainly includes the concept of Righteousness, which, as noted above, is the basis of the root cluster in Hebrew underlying the word Sadducee in Greek. This is how the term is used in the Pseudoclementine Recognitions, so important to a consideration of James. Here, the Sadducees are described as a group - like so-called ‘Zealots’ above - taking their rise in the time of John the Baptist and considering themselves ‘more Righteous than the others’, ‘separating themselves from the Assembly of the People’.8 

This definition of Sadducees is actually the way the term is defined by so-called Jewish ‘Karaites’ in the Middle Ages, who considered themselves latterday heirs to the Sadducees and actually called themselves the ‘Righteous Ones’.9 For both Josephus and the New Testament, this sense ends up by being rather expressed in terms of being ‘harsher in Judgement’.10 It should be appreciated that, whatever else the Qumran sectaries were, they were certainly very harsh and uncompromising where matters of ‘Judgement’ were concerned, and this aspect of their behaviour should become clear as we proceed. 

To distinguish the usage ‘Sons of Zadok’ as it occurs in the Qumran texts from ‘Sadducee’, scholars often use the terminology ‘Zadokite’. The use of the phrase ‘Sons of Zadok’ would probably actually coincide with the emergence of the Sadducee Party as a distinct group somewhere in the third to second centuries BC. It is not without interest, however, that when the Pseudoclementine Recognitions speaks of the ‘Sadducees’ as ‘taking their emergence with the coming of John the Baptist‘, this is the picture we would support, at least in the Herodian period, of two groups of Sadducees, one Establishment and the other Purist or Opposition. These last look very much like what in other vocabularies might be called ‘Messianic’ or ‘Zealot’ and the basis of the split would appear to revolve about seeking accommodation with foreign power and the perceived Righteousness or Unrighteousness of the High Priests. 

But the split between this Zadok and Boethus also occurs at the time Josephus describes the birth of another movement, a movement he calls the ‘Fourth Philosophy’ - more popularly known as ‘Zealots’ — upon which, as we saw, he lays all the woes that descended on the people in the first century. Not only does Josephus begin his discussion of the various Jewish sects in both his major works with the rise of this movement, but in the second of these, the Antiquities, he ascribes the birth of this movement to not one, as in the War, but two individuals, Judas the Galilean, and a second, probably more priestly, individual he designates only as ‘Saddok’, a term linguistically related both to the word ‘Sadducee’ in Greek and the ‘Zaddik’ in Hebrew, as we have seen 


The issue between this ‘Boethus and Saddok’, which Josephus delineates very clearly, is support of or opposition to the payment of the Roman tax. But this, of course, is the issue underlying the prominence given the Roman census - the Census of Cyrenius in 6 — 7 CE — at the time of the birth of Jesus in the mythologized portrait of this event in the Gospel of Luke (2:2). It is also a burning issue in the Gospel portraits of Jesus generally, where Jesus is presented as favouring the tax - though at one point Luke denies this, presenting one of the charges levelled against Jesus as teaching the people not to pay the tax to Caesar (Luke 23:2)!14 This is the context in which the notices about the two groups of Sadducees in Talmudic and Karaite sources - one supporting the priestly Establishment and the other opposing it - and collaboration with Rome generally should be placed. 

The circumstance that stands out in the period prior to the rise of the Maccabees and the Jewish independence movement associated with them in the second century BC is the continuation of priestly control. With the coming of Alexander the Great in 333 BC, two successor states under Hellenistic kings descended from his generals arose in Asia: the Seleucids in Syria and the Ptolemies in Egypt at Alexandria. Judea or Palestine — consisting of primarily the region around Jerusalem proper - swung back and forth under the control first of the former, then of the latter. As a rule, relations with the Greek Ptolemies in Egypt were more cordial than those with the Seleucids at Antioch, the Ptolemies being more tolerant. This is important because the Independence War, which broke out in 167 BC, was pointedly waged against Seleucid Hellenization and intolerance. 

At first the Maccabees seem to have affected only the title of ‘High Priest’. At some point in the first or third generations, however, the Greco-Roman title ‘King’ was added to their nomenclature. Though the Maccabees were from a priestly family, the question has been raised, in the debate relating to the Dead Sea Scrolls, whether they ‘usurped’ the High Priesthood.17 There is no indication whatsoever of such a usurpation, and the Maccabees seem to have occupied what appears to have been a very popular priesthood indeed. Josephus, for instance, at the end of the first century in Rome, evinces no embarrassment at the Maccabean blood he claims flows in his veins. On the contrary, he would appear to be most proud of it.1 

The appearance of the Romans in the eastern Mediterranean would appear to be referred to at an important juncture of the Book of Daniel, where their victory over the Syrian fleet in the eastern Mediterranean is mentioned (11:30-35 - 190 BC). This seems, in fact, to trigger the predatory activities upon the Temple by the Seleucid King Antiochus Epiphanes, the villain of both Daniel and the Maccabee books. Here too the Book of Daniel uses the key terminology the Kittim, which the Dead Sea Scrolls use to refer to foreign armies invading the country, to refer to the Romans (11:30).19 This is important for sorting out chronological problems at Qumran. 

Along with Ezekiel and Isaiah, Daniel is perhaps the most important scriptural inspiration for much of the apocalyptic ideology and symbolism of the Dead Sea Scrolls, as well as for the literature of Christianity. Daniel is also, chronologically speaking, one of the latest books in the scriptural canon, except perhaps for Esther. Esther, which came down to us through a more Eastern-oriented, extra-territorial transmission process, seems to be a more accommodating answer to Daniel’s uncompromising Messianic and apocalyptic nationalism. 

Daniel’s clear association with the Maccabean Uprising in Palestine was doubtlessly one of the reasons why the Rabbis, following the uprisings against Rome, downgraded it from its position among the ‘Prophets’, placing it among the lesser ‘Writings’. No doubt, the Rabbis saw Daniel as a representative of a new, more vivid, style of prophetic expression, which we now call apocalyptic. This style, which they downplayed because of its association with the movement that produced both the Maccabean Uprising and the Uprising against Rome, is very much admired in the documents from Qumran, as it is by New Testament writers. In it, prophetical and eschatological motifs - concerned with the ‘Last Times’ or the ‘Last Things’ - are combined amid the most awe-inspiring and blood-curdling imagery.

For instance, Daniel is the first document to refer to what might be described as a ‘Kingdom of God’. God is not only described as ‘enduring for ever’, ‘working signs and wonders in Heaven and on earth’, and ‘saving Daniel from the power of the lions’ (that is, death), but as having a ‘sovereignty which will never be destroyed’ and a ‘kingship that will never end’ (6:26- 28). Daniel also evokes the ‘Son of Man coming on the clouds of Heaven’, one of the basic scriptural underpinnings for the Messiahship of Jesus and a title always applied to him. This passage will also loom large below in the materials relating to James’ activities in the Temple and the proclamation he makes there. 


For Daniel, ‘the Holy Ones’ (Kedoshim) or ‘the Saints of the Most High God’ make war on an evil adversary or foreign invader who has violated the Temple and pillaged it for spoils. All these terms will be important for subsequent generations. This foreigner, who has ‘abolished the perpetual sacrifice’, is clearly described as Antiochus Epiphanes (7:13-8:12), the villain of Jewish Hanukkah festivities ever since. But Daniel also uses additional terms that became popular, particularly at Qumran, but also in the New Testament and the Koran, namely ‘the Last Days’, ‘the Wrath’, ‘the End’ or ‘the Time of the End’ and, of course, the resurrection of the dead (12:2 — 13). The way Daniel refers to the resurrection of the dead is particularly significant: Of those who lie sleeping in the dust of the earth, many will awake, some to everlasting life... cleansed, made white, and purged . . . [they] will rise for [their] share at the End of Time. Aside from ambiguous allusions in Psalms and a similar reference in 2 Maccabees, in the context of Judas Maccabee’s military activities (12:43-44), this is the only overt reference to this doctrine of resurrection in the entire Old Testament. It is noteworthy too that such references are normally associated with a kind of apocalyptic Holy War also outlined in Daniel. The reference in 2 Maccabees is presented in the context of the Maccabean Uprising against Hellenization and foreign rule in Palestine. Parallel descriptions in 1 Maccabees raise the banner of ‘zeal for the Law’ (meaning the Torah or the Law of Moses) or taking one’s ‘stand on the Covenant’ (2:27). We shall have occasion to refer to allusions like these with regard to James, as well as to the ‘Zealot’ Movement taking its inspiration from them. Josephus describes this movement, as already remarked, as beginning around the time the New Testament associates with the birth of Christ (4 BC — 7 CE), and continuing on to the fall of the Temple in 70 CE and possibly even beyond. 

It was apocalyptic literature of this kind that was seen by the Rabbis as the impetus behind the unrest that led to the disaster represented by the First Jewish Uprising against Rome (66-70 CE) and the destruction of the Temple and the State, not to mention the Second Uprising (132-6 CE). This literature was seen as fanning opposition to foreign rule. It encouraged an extreme zeal for the Law, that zealotry associated with Holy War, and a willingness to undergo martyrdom rather than to submit to foreign kingship, as well as an associated impetus towards Messianism. 


Since these ideas were all seen as stemming from the party or parties opposed to what the Pharisee predecessors of the Rabbis had represented - that is, seeking accommodation with Rome and foreign powers generally at all costs - they were considered reprehensible. It is therefore understandable that in the version of Jewish history that the Rabbis transmitted and in the collection of documents they finally declared to be Holy Writ at the beginning of the second century CE, books like the Maccabees were set aside and Daniel given the lowest priority 

But Josephus was also a turncoat, a traitor to his people. When reading him, this should always be kept in mind. It was on the basis of this betrayal that he was allowed to live and was not put to death like others who played a role in the events he describes. For Josephus did play a role in these events. Originally, by his own testimony, he was military commandant of Galilee - ‘Commissar’ might be more accurate - responsible for its organization and fortification in the early days of the Revolt. Given his role as a Pharisee priest, which he later used to extremely good effect, one wonders what his qualifications for such a command position might have been. 

Josephus was an interrogator of prisoners and his popularity among his fellow countrymen can be deduced from the following episode, which he describes in the Jewish War. Deputized by the Romans, presumably because he spoke Hebrew, to call up to the defenders on the walls of Jerusalem during its siege and ask for their surrender, he was hit on the head by a projectile thrown by someone on the battlements. When he fell, a spontaneous cheer erupted among those watching from the walls. Their enemy Josephus had been wounded.21 And this was the great Jewish historian! With military commanders or commissars like Josephus, the Jews had no need of enemies, and the military catastrophe that overtook them was inevitable. Later he uses the prestige his priestly status allowed him in the eyes of the Romans to appeal to their credulity and the exaggerated awe they felt for such augurs or foreign oracles.2 

It was to his role as a fortune-telling Jewish priest, supposedly held in high esteem by his own people, that his survival can be credited. He and several companions had taken refuge in a cave after the collapse of the military defence of Galilee, for which he was ostensibly responsible. The Romans were taking this time-honoured route on their way to lay siege to Jerusalem, and Josephus betrayed the suicide pact that he and a few companions had made - the normal ‘Zealot’ approach in such extreme circumstances. Instead, he and another colleague, after dispatching their comrades, surrendered to the Romans, an episode he relates quite shamelessly. 






Ushered into the Roman commander Vespasian’s presence, Josephus proceeded to apply the Messianic ‘Star Prophecy’ to him, prophesying that Vespasian was the one foretold in Jewish Scripture, who was going to come out of Palestine and rule the world. This was the prophecy that was of such importance to all resistance groups in this period, including those responsible for the documents at Qumran and the revolutionaries who triggered the war against Rome, not to mention the early Christians.23 The following year Vespasian was to replace Nero (54-68 CE) as Emperor. 

Of course, Josephus was not the only turncoat to whom sources attribute reversing the sense of the Messianic Prophecy, applying it to the destroyer of Jerusalem instead of to its liberator. Josephus, whether candid or not, considered himself a ‘Pharisee’, which is quite appropriate to this posture. Paul also proudly proclaims his own Pharisee origins in Philippians 3:5. The Book of Acts even has Paul claiming to have studied with Gamaliel, the grandson of one of the most important Pharisee fathers, Hillel, whose name is still proverbial in Judaism today (Acts 5:3 and 22:3 Hillel, together with another colleague named Shammai, also proverbial, was probably the head of the Herodian Sanhedrin, reconstituted after Herod seized power in 37 BC, and destroyed the remaining Maccabees and their seemingly ‘Sadducean’ supporters. 

Acts pictures Paul as being very proud of his Roman citizenship. In Romans 13:1-7 he almost makes a religion out of loyalty to Rome, placing the Pax Romana and Roman Law, which he even calls ‘God’s Law’, over Jewish Law or the law of his alleged countrymen (Rom. 13:4). His allegiance to this last - theological posturing or poetic allegorizing notwithstanding - was suspect at the best of times. For his part, Josephus obtained Roman citizenship after his obsequious humiliation before Vespasian and consonant adoption into the latter’s family, the Flavians, whose name he came to bear. The Rabbis, who became the Roman tax collectors in Palestine after the fall of the Temple, claim the same behaviour for the progenitor of the form of Judaism they followed, Rabbinic Judaism-to-be, Rabbi Yohanan ben Zacchai. Rabbi Yohanan seems also to have been involved in the process of fixing the Jewish Canon at the end of the first century. Like Hillel and Shammai before him with Herod, Rabbi Yohanan’s behaviour with the Romans has become paradigmatic. He is described in rabbinic sources as applying the same ‘Star Prophecy’, the most precious prophecy of the Jewish people at that time, to the conqueror of Jerusalem, Vespasian, who was elevated to supreme ruler of the known civilized world after his military exploits in Palestine

As the rabbinic presentation of this story goes, Rabbi Yohanan, after having himself smuggled out of Jerusalem in a coffin - quite appropriately, as it turns out; besides, it was the only exit possible at the time - had an arrow shot into Vespasian’s camp, attached to which was a note claiming that ‘Rabbi Yohanan is one of the Emperor’s friends’.24 Doubtless this was true, but the camp had to have been Titus’, because Vespasian, the founder of the new Flavian line of emperors, had already gone to Rome at this point to assume his crown, leaving Titus behind to wind things up in Palestine. Rabbi Yohanan, as Talmudic materials present him, then had himself ushered into Vespasian’s presence to proclaim the very same thing Josephus recounts he did, that Vespasian was the Ruler prophesied to come out of Palestine and rule the world. Whether Josephus was a cynical opportunist or not, his account is the more credible, though both may be true. If so, Vespasian must have become very impatient of all these Jewish turncoats obsequiously fawning on him and proclaiming him the Ruler foreseen in Jewish Scripture, who was to come out of Palestine to rule the world (or maybe he didn’t). For his part, the Romans accorded R. Yohanan the academy at Yavneh, where the foundations of what was to become Rabbinic Judaism were laid; whereas Josephus was adopted for services rendered - writing the Jewish War being one of them - into the Roman imperial family itself. 

In Josephus’ case, the contacts for his treachery had already been laid some time before. As he recounts it, he knew someone in the Roman camp, someone he had met on a previous mission to Rome on behalf of some obscure priests who, he contends, were being held on a ‘trifling’ charge of some kind.25 These priests, like Paul according to Acts, had appealed to Caesar, that is Nero - ‘Augustus’ as Acts sometimes calls him (25:21 — 25) — and were probably connected in some manner to the ‘Temple Wall’ Affair. In this affair, which in our view led directly to the death of James, a wall had been built - presumably by ‘Zealot’ priests - to block the Herodian King Herod Agrippa II (49-93 CE) from viewing the Temple sacrifice while reposing and eating on the balcony of his palace 


In his autobiographical excursus, called the Vita appended to the Antiquities, Josephus describes how, as a young priest in his mid-twenties, he went to Rome on a mission to rescue those who had gone there and been detained as a result, presumably, of the ‘Temple Wall’ Affair. Somehow he had gained access through a well-connected Jewish actor to Nero’s wife, Poppea, whom he elsewhere describes as being interested in religious causes, Jewish or otherwise. It will be remembered that Nero, too, enjoyed the company of people of the theatre. So pleased was Poppea with the young Josephus that he apparently attained all he wished of her - and perhaps more - for he proudly brags that she sent him away laden with gifts. One wonders what else the artful young priest managed to achieve during his stay, apart from the contacts he made in Roman intelligence circles that served him so well when Roman armies finally did appear in Galilee three years later. It was also as a result of the ‘Temple Wall’ Affair that the ‘conspiracy’ was hatched between Agrippa II and the then High Priest Ananus ben Ananus to remove James.27 Indeed, it was at approximately this time that the ever mercurial and doubtlessly deranged Nero proceeded to kick Poppea, who was now pregnant, to death. After this, Nero too seems to have pursued his persecutions of the Jews more determinedly than ever, seemingly purposefully goading them into revolt 

Neither do the Gospels or Acts give any hint of the background situation of terrifying political strife, disaffection and day-to-day cruelties that resulted in thousands of crucifixions (not just one), which Josephus for puerile interests of his own lovingly dwells on. But the welter of historical data one finds in Josephus, however unpalatable, is subordinated in them to the deification of Christ and the conciliation of his message, so that one would not even know there was such internecine political strife and an intensity of hatred abroad that only the martyrdom of beloved leaders could produce. 

Finally he condemns those with no first-hand knowledge of the affair, collecting vain and inconsistent stories on the basis of hearsay and writing garbled accounts of it, while eye-witness accounts have been falsified either to flatter the Romans or to vilify the jews.28 Nothing could better enunciate the method and historical style of this period, particularly of works that survived such as the Gospels and the Book of Acts. 

The Habakkuk Pesher, which, unlike Josephus, almost did not survive and did so only because it was deposited in the caves at Qumran, gives a totally opposite picture of the behaviour of these rampaging foreign armies who ‘sacrifice to their standards and worship their weapons of war’ and ‘took no pity even on the fruit of the womb’.29 But Josephus regularly praises ‘the good order of the Romans’, ‘their clemency towards the people’ and ‘their indulgence in sparing foreigners’ (like himself), as opposed to what he characterizes as ‘the brutality of the revolutionaries against the people’! 30 Perhaps even more meaningfully, when one remembers the picture of Roman behaviour generally in the Gospels, he presents the Romans as ‘unwillingly attacking’ the Jews, insisting that the Romans ‘were invited into Jerusalem by the Jews’ own leaders’, which is, as we shall see, true from a certain perpective but not precisely in the manner Josephus is presenting it. 

Finally, and most chillingly of all, Josephus asserts that the ‘calamities’ and ‘misfortunes and sufferings’ that overtook the Jews were inflicted on them because of their own behaviour - in this instance, because ‘they were afflicted by sedition’. In the literature of the early Church fathers, particularly Eusebius, this observation is transformed into the accusation that ‘the Jews suffered the calamities and misfortunes’ they did ‘because of their crimes against our Saviour’ 

Compounding this parallel with Gospel method and presentation - though forced to admit what had to be obvious to anyone, that Titus ‘destroyed Jerusalem’ - for Josephus, ‘the Temple was burned against the consent of Caesar’. In the same manner, the Gospels portray Jesus as being destroyed against the wishes of the Roman governor. Parallels of this kind are of the utmost importance, particularly when one realizes that in the Gospels Jesus is the ‘Temple’ (John 2: 19), a presentation developed further and with a good deal of poetic artistry in the Pauline corpus 

This cry of mea culpa is so familiar, because one has already encountered it in the famous cry of the Jewish crowd in the Gospel of Matthew, ‘his blood be upon us and upon our children’ (27:25). 

Josephus describes the Jewish sects of this period in a somewhat tendentious manner. The New Testament attempts a parallel presentation, but objective observers regard this picture as being largely based on Josephus. The Talmud, based on Pharisaic tradition, presents an equally tendentious picture of ‘us’, that is, Rabbinical Judaism versus all other groups, lumped together simply as minim - ‘sects’. Sometimes these last are even called ‘Sadducees’ without further elucidation as to whether they are the Sadducees of the New Testament period or another, more ‘Zealot’ group earlier or contemporaneous with them. 

Where these more or less opposing groups of Sadducees - Herodian (Establishment) or separatist (Purist) - are concerned, there are, to be sure, common approaches to legal minutiae that so obsess the authors of Talmudic tradition and, one might add, their contemporary heirs. However, in the broad lines of hostility towards the Establishment and, for instance, its fornication - including divorce, marriage, and incest - there is almost nothing in common between them. Nor is there anything in common between them regarding antagonism to foreign rule, including foreign-appointed kings, foreign-appointed High Priests, and foreign gifts and sacrifices in the Temple, which so obsess the sectaries at Qumran. 

it is interesting to point out that Phineas, portrayed in Numbers as functioning in the wilderness at the time of Moses, is accorded the High Priestly Covenant in perpetuity, because of the ‘zeal’ he displayed in killing backsliders who were marrying foreigners, thereby deflecting pollution from the camp of Israel. 

I Maccabees 2:26 raises this Covenant on behalf of Judas Maccabee’s father, Mattathias, and presumably all of his descendants succeeding to him. But this Phineas, who was Aaron’s grandson, was also the High Priestly ancestor of the Zadok of David’s time, an important connection between the Zealot and Zadokite ideologies. This idea of ‘pollution’ in the camp of Israel in the wilderness as relating to the issue of mixing with foreigners has important ramifications in the Qumran documents and is the focus of the ‘Zealot’ ethos. 


There is an even better description of these Essenes, which includes several important points linking them closely with James’ followers in Palestine, in a work called the Refutation of All Heresies, attributed to Hippolytus, an early third-century Church writer in Rome (160-235). This description is clearly a more detailed and possibly an even earlier version of Josephus’ description of the Essenes in the Jewish War. In it, ‘Zealots’ and their more extreme counterparts, the ‘Sicarii’ (‘Assassins’ - so styled because of the Arab-style dagger they concealed under their cloaks) are seen only as Essenes less prepared to compromise.2 This is important and clarifies the sectarian situation in Palestine considerably. 

This may be explained by the fact that all groups of this kind are simply being referred to retrospectively, as we have noted, a s minim (‘sects’) or Saddukim (‘Sadducees’) after the Pharisees cum Rabbis took control of Jewish life in the wake of the failure of the Uprising against Rome. In using these notations, no attempt was made to draw fine distinctions, if in fact these were even appreciated by the time the Talmudic materials were finally redacted in the ‘Oral Law’ or Mishnah in the second and third centuries CE. 

The surprising absence of references to ‘Essenes’ per se in the New Testament is even more easily explained. The New Testament refers to Pharisees, Sadducees (sometimes ‘Scribes’), Herodians, and even to a certain extent Zealots - these, as in the case of Simon the Zealot, within Jesus’ following, not outside it. The same goes for the term Sicarii, probably reprised by names like Judas Iscariot and his father, Simon Iscariot (thus - John 6:71) and straightforwardly transliterated into Greek in Acts 21: 3 8. The reason Josephus’ Essenes are missing from this list is that this is the group that the New Testament is itself. That said, the New Testament is developing additional terminology to describe itself, that of ‘Nazoraeans’/‘Nazirites’/‘Nazrenes’ or, as some like Hippolytus would have it, ‘Naassenes’, a seeming combination of Nazrenes and Essenes.7 Though this complicates the situation, for Hippolytus these last are basically synonymous both with Essenes and another group always mentioned as connected to James, ‘the Ebionites’ or ‘the Poor 

The New Testament is aware of ‘the Poor’ allusions, and other related terms such as ‘the Meek’ or ‘these Little Ones’; as is Qumran, which knows an additional variation, ‘the Simple of Judah doing Torah’, and a further one related to these and the manner in which the Gospels describe John the Baptist’s activities in the wilderness, ‘the Way’.8 This allusion, which is in omnipresent use at Qumran where it is applied to ‘wilderness’ activities too, is also in use in the New Testament as an alternative name for Christianity in Palestine.9 But all of these names are, obviously, by the middle of the first century, denoting Jewish Christians of one kind or another 

It is quite likely that Josephus also fell foul of Titus’ younger brother and successor, Domitian (81-96), who was considered to be as mad, unpredictable, and sadistically violent as Nero had been. Indeed, the mercurial Domitian seems to have executed his secretary, Josephus’ publisher Epaphroditus, who had also been Nero’s secretary previously and someone with whom Paul appears to have been extremely intimate.10 In addition, this Epaphroditus, as is clear from Josephus’ introductions, encouraged Josephus in all his works, particularly his Antiquities, which was published in 94 CE just a little before both disappeared from the scene. Like Epaphroditus, Josephus just drops from sight around this time and may or may not have been executed in the course of Domitian’s often brutal or sadistic approach to political affairs. Trajan (98-117), whose father had been commander of the Tenth Legion in Palestine under Vespasian and Titus, then proceeded to have his difficulties with Messianic agitation and unrest, particularly in the eastern portions of his empire. 

For instance, his Sadducees bear no relation to the Qumran Sadducees (or ‘Essenes’) whatsoever. As he tells us quite straightforwardly, the former were dominated in all things by the Pharisees, except, it would appear, in the matter of resurrection of the dead, a distinction the New Testament is also quick to seize on.11 His Sadducees are simply upper-class priests of the Herodian period, but how these Sadducees relate to the Maccabeans, who had been the High Priests for a century or more previously, is impossible to say. The Maccabees, by and large, must be considered Sadducees, but they bear almost no relationship to the Sadducees Josephus and the New Testament are describing in the first century. In fact, as I have been at pains to point out, they bear more relationship to Qumran and to those later called ‘Zealots’ than anything else. I have in previous works referred to the Qumran or ‘Purist Sadducees’ as ‘Messianic Sadducees’, taking into account their Messianic tendencies. Others might wish to call them ‘Essenes’ or ‘Zealots’, as they do indeed display characteristics of both as described in Josephus. But they also display characteristics of what in other quarters are being called Nazoraeans/Nazrenes/Jewish Christians or Ebionites. 

The point is that these sects or terminologies tend to slide around a good deal, depending on who is doing the observing, what vocabulary he is employing, and what his own misunderstandings or prejudices might be 

For this reason, it is proper to refer to the authors of these documents as comprising a Movement of some kind which is always, at its core, anti-Establishment. Its precise name for the moment must be left indeterminate, but ‘the Way’, ‘the Sons of Zadok’, ‘the Poor’, ‘the Simple’, ‘the Meek’, ‘the Perfect’, ‘the Sons of Light’, ‘the Holy Ones’ or combinations such as ‘the Zealots for the Day of Vengeance’, ‘the Poor Ones of Piety‘, ‘the Zealots for Righteousness’ and ‘Perfect of the Way’ are all terms cropping up in their repertoire as self-designations. 

Where the first century CE is concerned, it is also useful to consider the opposition groups in terms of their various degrees of ‘zeal’, extending from the more pacifist to the more violent. This is how Hippolytus discusses his ‘Essenes’, who range by degrees to the most extreme Sicarii, namely those Josephus describes as committing suicide on Masada along the Dead Sea south of Qumran in the last instalment of the War against Rome. If one keeps one’s eyes firmly fixed on support of or opposition to the Herodian Establishment, supplanting the Maccabean from the 60S to the 30S BC, one will never go far astray. Those supporting this Establishment can, echoing language found in the Dead Sea Scrolls, be described as ‘seeking accommodation with foreigners’, which the GrecoIdumaean Herodians and their Roman overlords were most certainly considered to be. 

Whether in their present-day Orthodox, Conservative, Liberal, or Reform embodiments, all not only claim to be heirs to the Pharisaic legacy but in addition - and, as we shall see, even more astonishing - that the Pharisees were the popular party of the first century CE. For this reason, many Jews, even secular ones, are unable to grasp the true import of their own Hanukkah festivities, which are basically a celebration of Maccabean, anti-foreign, non-accommodationist, priestly zeal. This is because this tradition, too, which is diametrically opposed to the inherited one, has been downplayed, trivialized and virtually written out of Talmudic literature, where most references to the Maccabees are negative for the same reason that they are in Christianity 

But the Pharisees were not the popular party of their time and place, despite Josephus’ attempts - and those of Rabbinic Judaism thereafter - to prove otherwise. To clarify and highlight this, I have in my work generally redefined Pharisees as those ‘seeking accommodation with foreigners’. This plays on phraseology in use at Qumran to characterize its opponents or enemies, ‘the Seekers after Smooth Things’ - even ‘Smoothies’. Clearly this is a hostile designation. It is also possible to apply this appellation to Pauline or Overseas Christians, who, in terms of political attitudes anyhow, are not very different from Pharisees. This puts the proposition in the broad brushstrokes that have meaning for the period before us, dispensing with the kind of legal hair-splitting one usually hears about. 

The Establishment groups, quite simply put, were the Pharisees, Sadducees and Herodians, the last being those members of the Herodian power structure and their associates not encompassed under the preceding two designations. One might as well add to these Pauline or Overseas Gentile Christians as the only Christian group of any consequence that really survived in the West after the obliteration of the Jerusalem centre and the Temple. If there is any question about this, one has only to look at Romans 13:1-7 noted above and the attitudes towards Roman law and authority displayed there. 

But as I have been at pains to assert, Pauline Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism are two sides of the same coin. Both develop in conjunction with each other and both follow an accommodationist policy towards Rome, which is why no doubt both survived. In this context, the main difference is that one is pro-Law and the other against it. But the points of accommodation here are not the minor ones belaboured in Rabbinic tradition, such as those connected with dietary regulations, sexual purification or Sabbath observation, though these played a part. Rather, they are the broad lines of accommodation with foreigners in a political sense, seen by Qumran and ‘Zealot’-style groups generally as ‘breaking the Law’. 

These included, in addition to opposition to foreign kings, which the Herodians most certainly were considered to be by opposition groups, and opposition to the foreign appointment of High Priests - a consequence of the destruction of the Maccabean family by Herod, to which so-called ‘Zealots’ were so opposed, and most likely Jamesian Christians as well, opposition to the receipt of gifts or sacrifices in the Temple from or on behalf of foreigners, seen at Qumran and probably by Jewish Christians as well as ‘pollution of the Temple’. This, as will be seen below, triggered the Uprising against Rome. Finally there were the sexual and marital practices to which the Pharisees and Sadducees turned a blind eye but which were opposed in the most extreme manner by all groups like those at Qumran and early Christians of the ‘Jamesian’ persuasion. 

So far as Qumran was concerned, these practices included polygamy, divorce and, most importantly for making secure identifications in this period, marriage with nieces or close family cousins. This last was simply considered an extension of the ban on incest at Qumran.14 Like the complaints of John the Baptist against the Establishment, such criticisms were obviously aimed at members of the Herodian family and their supporters. All are included under the broad phraseology of ‘fornication’ at Qumran, the specific condemnation of which is also prominent in all reports and traditions associated with James’ teachings and directives. 

For instance, it is clear that the Maccabean Uprising was not Pharisaic, yet this was most certainly popular. In fact, the Pharisees may have got their name, which means ‘those who separated from’ or ‘splitters away’, from a group in the second century BC described in I Maccabees as deserting the cause of the Maccabeans in favour of a foreign-appointed High Priestly claimant (7:13 — 18). 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyam_Maccoby#

According to Maccoby, the founding of Christianity as a religion separate from Judaism was entirely the work of Paul of Tarsus.[3] In this Maccoby's view is largely based on that of Heinrich Graetz. 

Maccoby claimed that Paul was a Hellenized Jewish convert or perhaps even a Gentile, from a background in which he had been exposed to the influence of Gnosticism and the pagan mystery religions, such as the Attis cult, a myth involving a life-death-rebirth deity. The mystery religions, according to Maccoby, were the dominant religious forms in the Hellenistic world of that age and strongly influenced Paul's mythological psychology. Maccoby partially derived his theory from fragments of the writings of opponents of Ebionites, particularly the treatise on Heresies by Epiphanius of Salamis.
Maccoby considered Paul's claims to an orthodox Pharisaic Jewish education to be false and asserted that while many of Paul's writings sound authentic to the uninitiated, they actually betray an ignorance of the original Hebrew scripture and the subtleties of Jewish Law.[6] Maccoby claimed that an examination of the New Testament indicates that Paul knew no Hebrew at all and relied entirely on Greek texts that no actual Pharisee would ever use because they were not properly translated from the Hebrew originals.
According to Maccoby, Paul fused the historical story of Jesus' crucifixion with elements of contemporary mystery religions and Gnosticism and developed such new non-Judaic mythic ideas as the Trinity and the Last Supper. Paul also made an attempt to find prophetic justification for his newly created myth in the Old Testament. Paul came to present Jesus as a dying and rising saviour deity similar to those from the Hellenistic mystery cults, fused with the historical pedigree of Judaism, and thus gave birth to a powerful new myth whose preaching gained him a large following. As the Jerusalem group of the original disciples of Jesus gradually became aware of Paul's teachings, bitter hostility ensued between them.
Maccoby interpreted certain New Testament passages (such as Paul's account of his quarrel with Peter in the Incident at Antioch) as remnants of authentic accounts of that hostility. However, the Jewish Rebellion of 66–70 soon brought a violent end to the Jerusalem sect, and the Gentile Church that was founded by Paul emerged as the winner by default. Maccoby viewed the Book of Acts as a later attempt by the Pauline Church to present the relations between Paul and the Jerusalem disciples as harmonious and the Pauline Church as legitimised by the chain of apostolic succession reaching back to the original disciples of Jesus. Maccoby also conjectured that the Jewish-Christian sect of Ebionites may have been an authentic offshoot of the original Jerusalem community.

Reception of Maccoby's view of Paul has generally been negative.[8] John Gager of Princeton University reviewed The Mythmaker (1986) in the Jewish Quarterly Review (1988), describing part of Maccoby's thesis as &quot;perverse misreading&quot; and concluded &quot;Thus I must conclude that Maccoby's book is not good history, not even history at all.&quot;[9] Skarsaune (2002), referencing Maccoby's work and the theory that Paul represents a Christianity totally different from that of the early community in Jerusalem, writes that &quot;Acts provides no evidence to substantiate this theory.&quot;[10] James D. G. Dunn (2006) describes Maccoby's revival of Graetz' accusations that Paul was a Gentile as &quot;a regrettable reversion to older polemics&quot;.[11] The continuity with Graetz is also noted by Langton (2009), who contrasts Maccoby's approach with adherents of a &quot;building bridges&quot; view, such as Isaac Mayer Wise, Joseph Krauskopf, and Claude Montefiore, even if they shared some details of the polemic critique of Paul.[12] 

Thus far the picture of the ''Jesus movement'' is intelligible, thoroughly Jewish, and marked by law-observant continuity. The people in this picture are also eminently admirable. From Jesus onward they are all Pharisees, realistic activists, engaged in resistance against Roman occupation, determined to make the world a better place in which to live and not to escape from it into some otherworldly form of romanticism. 

First, there is the argument from comparative religion. Paul is said to have drawn the core of his theology from Gnosticism, a religion characterized by Mr. Maccoby as inherently anti-Semitic. Nowhere, however, does Mr. Maccoby identify Gnostic sources that can be dated as early as Paul's letters. Moreover, again and again, where Mr. Maccoby turns to Gnosticism to explain a Pauline motif, the data in Paul's letters themselves call instead for comparison with Jewish apocalyptic writings, notably the type of apocalyptic we know from the Dead Sea Scrolls.
In the letter to the Galatians, for example, Paul interprets Jesus's crucifixion by citing a verse from Deuteronomy, ''Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,'' a pronouncement having originally nothing to do with crucifixion. Our understanding of Paul's exegesis of this verse has been greatly improved since the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, for in two of them, not mentioned by Mr. Maccoby, we find the same text from Deuteronomy interpreted as a reference to crucifixion. This shows that Paul's interpretation is scarcely a piece of pagan thought that is ''alien to Jewish thinking,'' as Mr. Maccoby says. In sum, the argument that Paul developed the core of his theology from pagan, anti-Semitic, forms of religion is without foundation.

For Mr. Maccoby, as for others from the theologian Robert Eisler to the historian S. G. F. Brandon, Jesus must have been a nationalistic political figure who was threatening to the Romans, not an extraordinary religious figure who was odious to some of the Jewish authorities. The Gospels consistently report, however, that Jesus's disciples were not arrested along with Him, and that development is altogether unlikely for members of a seditious movement. Never mind, says Mr. Maccoby; the Gospel writers, intent on depoliticizing Jesus, omitted to mention the ''details of the arrest of Jesus' followers.'' Which details? The nonexistent ones required by the presupposed portrait of Jesus.
Do things improve when Mr. Maccoby takes us to the Pauline documents? Not very much. Those who wish to make Paul's acquaintance have at their disposal sources that fall into three categories: seven letters written by Paul himself in the sixth decade of the first century; Luke's account in the Acts of the Apostles, penned at the end of the century, along with several letters written by Paul's followers; and finally, references to Paul in the traditions of Jewish-Christian groups, such as the Ebionites and their like, ranging in date from the late second century into the fourth. All of the items in this third category (mainly the Ascents of James, the Preachings of Peter, and a brief paragraph in the fourth-century ramblings about the Ebionites in the major work of the church father Epiphanius) have been meticulously studied since the seminal labors of F. C. Baur (1792-1860). It is widely known that the least reliable of them is the brief paragraph in Epiphanius. From this paragraph, clearly a mixture of fable and slander, Mr. Maccoby draws the major dimensions of his portrait of Paul, using it to correct Paul's own letters and Luke's account! Little cause for wonder, then, that the slander continues. In Mr. Maccoby's account Paul, a man of doubtful antecedents, lacking in logical ability because of a feeble educational base, having failed in his attempt to become a genuine Jew, threaded his way by guile through a series of stormy episodes and, in short, told lies.

That descendants of those who for centuries were charged with deicide, descendants of those who were peremptorily summoned to the so-called Jewish-Christian disputations in the Middle Ages, descendants of those who were told in the 19th century to assimilate or suffer the consequences, descendants of those who were taken by the millions to the gas chambers, assimilated or not - that these descendants should find it difficult to trust what is said by a Christian, modern or ancient, calls for no explanation and should receive none. More than distrust, however, is required of the historian.WE are left, then, with the unwanted conclusion that historical tendentiousness precludes Mr. Maccoby's book on Paul from serving as a potent antidote to the virus of anti-Semitism among Christians. The conclusion is doubly unfortunate - first because the author has put a good deal of work and sincerely held passion into the book and second (and much more important) because there is in fact a connection between Paul and anti-Semitism that demands serious attention: anti-Semites have been able to employ unconscionably some of Paul's utterances to their own ends. Indeed Paul said things that - torn from the literary, historical and theological contexts in which he said them - have been used to dehumanize Jews, women and, not least, black slaves and their descendants. Such statements call, however, not for superficial castigation of Paul, but rather for contextual interpretation; whoever engages in such interpretation will discern that Paul was not a romantic dreamer but a warrior in both worlds who was active against all forms of enslavement to the status quo. 

To apply the name &quot;kurios&quot; or Lord in its divine sense to a human being who had recently lived and died on Earth would have seemed to any Pharisee or other Jew sheer blasphemy. However, to the recipients of Paul's letters, the use of the term &quot;Lord&quot; for Yeshua would not have seemed shocking at all, for this was the regular term for the deities of the mystery cults, those salvation gods with whom the devotees united their souls in communal dying and resurrection as just mentioned above. 






Strabo, the Greek historian, geographer and philosopher writes in his Geography (xiv, 5. 12ff.) that Tarsus was a leading cultural and educational center, surpassing even Athens and Alexandria.  Its people, he says, were avid in their pursuit of culture, applying themselves to the study of philosophy, literature, music and the whole round of liberal arts.  


Roman citizenship was originally confined to freeborn natives of Rome, but as the Empire expanded citizenship was extended to other people in the provinces.  Presumably, St. Paul’s father, grandfather or even great-grandfather had acquired Roman citizenship, either by making a significant contribution to the Roman Empire (militarily, or more likely, economically), or by purchasing Roman citizenship through political connections and cash.   In addition, Dio Chrysostom, in his Oration (34, 23) tells us that enrolling as a Roman citizen in Tarsus required owning property in excess of 500 drachmae—not an easy threshold to meet.  St. Paul’s family clearly had both money and status. 

Right from the start, Alexander appears to be having problems with them and must, therefore, be considered a Sadducee. Finally, when Alexander takes to the ‘wilderness’ around Jerusalem in the style of his great-uncle Judas Maccabee, as well as the sectaries at Qumran and John the Baptist, the people have a change of heart and support him, defeating the Syrians.18 Alexander then turns on the Pharisees, who collaborated with the foreign invaders and betrayed him, crucifying some eight hundred of them or, as Josephus depicts it, hanging them up alive. It would appear that this event is also being described somewhat disapprovingly - presumably because of the ‘hanging’ or ‘crucifixion’ involved - in the Nahum Commentary, which is not otherwise hostile to Alexander. On the contrary, it is sympathetic to him.19 However this may be, it is clear that the people, after some initial hesitation, support Alexander Jannaeus. 


107

In the next generation, that of the Roman conquest (63 BC), there is another split between nationalists and anti-nationalists, this time between Alexander’s obviously Sadducean younger son Aristobulus II (67-49 BC) and his more accommodating older brother Hyrcanus II (76-31 BC), the only Maccabean supporting the Pharisees. Once again, the people support Aristobulus, who in Josephus’ own words ‘turned sick of servility’ and refused to abase himself before the Roman commander Pompey, who is coming in via Syria and Transjordan at precisely this moment 

It is in the course of these events that the father of Herod - on his father’s side, a Hellenized Idumaean; on his mother’s, an Arab - ingratiates himself with the Romans, in the process promoting the more manageable and docile older brother, Hyrcanus, the High Priest enjoying Pharisee support. As a result, Herod’s father - who was called Antipater - makes himself the first Roman Procurator in Palestine. Eventually he was able to secure for his son not only the kingship in Palestine, but also a Roman citizenship for himself and his heirs for services rendered in the interests of Rome in perpetuity. 

During the course of these troubles, Josephus specifically identifies as ‘Pharisees’ those who take vengeance on the priestly supporters of the ‘Zealot’ younger brother Aristobulus - in this instance, equivalent to nationalist or ‘Purist’ Sadducees - who take refuge, significantly, in the Temple. These Pharisees co-operate with Herod’s father Antipater and join the Romans in storming the Temple against the will of the people. . As Josephus bears witness, they engage in the wholesale slaughter that ensues even more enthusiastically than the Romans. Josephus rather pictures the Romans as watching in bemused astonishment as these prototypically ‘Zealot’ priestly supporters of Aristobulus are cut down as they dutifully perform the obligatory Temple sacrifices even as the Roman soldiers and their Pharisee allies overwhelm them 

Josephus notes Pollio’s and Sameas’ soothsaying powers in predicting how Herod would eventually become king. This kind of soothsaying is also emulated with equally salutary effect in a later generation by another self-professed Pharisee, Josephus himself, not to mention the so-called ‘prophets and teachers’ involved in the founding of Paul’s Antioch community, where ‘Christians’ were first called Christians according to Acts 11:26. Even more to the point, Josephus notes their recommendation to the people, ‘to open the gates to Herod’ and the Roman army, a recommendation that should be seen as paradigmatic of the Pharisee Party 

The date is 37 BC. Herod and his Roman sponsors had been worsted with Persian help by a scion of the Maccabean family, the son of the Aristobulus mentioned above, Antigonus. Herod, who had fled to Rome, returned with a Roman army provided him by Mark Anthony. It is at this point that Pollio/Hillel and Sameas/Shammai give their prototypical advice to ‘open the gates to Herod’, which the people, as usual, promptly reject in favour of resistance. It is in the course of these events that Herod, by astute political manoeuvring and simple bloody- mindedness, is able to obtain the title of King, that is, ‘King of the Jews’,24 even though he was not himself Jewish or of Jewish blood. 

Rather he had ‘spies posted everywhere’ and ‘never left off taking vengeance on those who had opposed him‘, which included the previously pro-Maccabean, presumably Sadducean, Sanhedrin. This he completely decimated, ‘while those who supported him, he showered with benefits of all kinds’ and promoted;25 chief among whom were the two Pharisee leaders, Pollio and Sameas, the only ones from the previous Maccabean-dominated and nationalist Sanhedrin to survive. It is at this point, in 37 BC, that one can really begin to speak of a Pharisee-dominated Sanhedrin, the one pictured in the New Testament 
From this point on, particularly after the death of Herod in 4 BC, we get an endless succession of revolts until the final Uprising in 66-70 CE. This last certainly has to be considered ‘popular’, as all groups except the Pharisees, the Herodians and the High Priests, even the so-called ‘Essenes’ and, one must assume, the ‘Jewish Christians’ participated in it. With the demise of the Maccabean family too, this turmoil is exacerbated by a new principle of leadership authority, which probably should be called ‘Messianic’. The High Priests created by the Herods are completely decimated by the ‘Zealots’ - and now these really are Zealots. 

It is a curious coincidence that Josephus launches into both his descriptions of the Jewish sects in the War and the Antiquities at just the point he comes to describe the Movement founded by the Judas the Galilean. This he calls a new ‘philosophy which our people were before unacquainted with’.26 In the Antiquities, as we saw, he adds another individual to his description of its beginnings. Someone he neglected to mention in the War, he refers to him mysteriously simply as ‘Saddok’, that is to say, ‘Zadok’ or ‘the Zaddik’ 

We shall have occasion variously below to describe this Fourth Philosophy or Movement, which Josephus declines to identify further, except to say that ‘they had an inviolable attachment to liberty and will not call any man Lord’.27 At present, it is sufficient to point out that this group or movement arises at just the moment one would expect it to, when the previous leadership has been eliminated and new leadership principles, including the Messianic, emerge. 

Eleven years after the death of Herod the Romans annexed the country and, in anticipation of direct taxation by governors or procurators, imposed a census. This is the 6-7 CE Census of Quirinius (Cyrenius), Roman Governor in Syria, the Census by which the Gospel of Luke dates the birth of Jesus (2: I). The Gospel of Matthew by contrast has Jesus being born some time before the death of Herod in 4 BC, so that Herod can attempt to chase him down and kill all the Jewish children, as did Pharaoh at the time of the birth of Moses. The two accounts are, of course, irreconcilable 

This issue is also a burning one for Gospel narratives, and Jesus’ riposte concerning it to ‘the Pharisees and the Herodians’ (Matt. 22:2I; rather termed ‘spies’ in Luke 20:20), ‘render unto Caesar what is Caesar’s and God what is God’s’, has now become proverbial - strange because the Gospels have Jesus adopting the Pharisee policy on this.2 

He claims that the thing that most moved the people to revolt against Rome was an ambiguous prophecy from their Scripture [ambiguous presumably because it was capable of so many interpretations] that one from their country should rule the entire world. 
As with his picture of ‘the Zealot woes’, for Josephus they had only themselves to blame for what ensued, because they interpreted this oracle ‘to suit themselves and went so mad because of it’ 

But this is precisely the Prophecy he has just finished applying to Vespasian, thus saving his own skin - as, one might add, did R. Yohanan and his Pharisees along with him. He does so again in this passage. This is the prophecy we have been calling ‘the World Ruler’ or ‘Messianic Prophecy‘, ‘the Star Prophecy’. At Qumran, where it occurs three times even in the extant corpus, it receives a wholly other, completely uncompromising, nationalistic and Messianic interpretation. In addition to remarking earlier how ‘zealous’ the young men were for this approach, Josephus notes that The Jews thought this prediction applied only to themselves, and therefore, many of their most learned men had deceived themselves in this determination. 

But this is precisely the Qumran interpretation as well, the representatives of which would never have stooped to the cynical opportunism of applying it to the destroyer of Jerusalem Vespasian, whatever the short-term benefits. In revealing this, Josephus, of course, also reveals that Zealots and other parties displaying the ‘zeal of Phineas’ were not simply political, but religious and Messianic as well. 

This is proof that the Uprising against Rome, aside from being popular - which it was most definitely - was also Messianic. What is more, that since the Uprising was Messianic - and ethically and historically this is of the utmost importance - the Jews lost everything not because they opposed the Messiah, as early Church Fathers or the New Testament in their tendentious presentation of Christ’s death and its meaning would have us believe, but, on the contrary, because they were so uncompromisingly Messianic. This is no mean proposition and constitutes an important reversal or inversion of historical invective as it has come down to us. 

Not only was the Uprising aimed at burning the palaces of the High Priests and the Herodian Kings but the debt records as well, in order, as Josephus makes clear, ‘to turn the Poor against the Rich’.32 Once again, this is the same genre of language evinced in the Letter of James and the Dead Sea Scrolls in their condemnation of ‘the Rich’. It is also the language applied to the Movement led by James, by Paul (Gal. 2: 10) and to the later Ebionites, so named because of it, as well as the nomenclature used by the Movement represented by the Scrolls to describe its own rank and file - called there as well ‘the Ebionim’ or ‘the Poor’. 

Before leaving this subject of the outbreak of the Uprising in 66 CE, it is important to note that in a final moment of unparalleled candour Josephus tells us that it was ‘the principal Pharisees, the Chief Priests, the men of power [by which he means Herodians], and all those desirous for peace’ who invited the Roman army into Jerusalem ‘to put down the Uprising’. This is what Josephus meant in the Introduction to the War about how the Romans were invited into the city by ‘the Jews’ own leaders’. 

Here one comes to an even more startling detail provided by Josephus, if what he seems to be saying can be tied to characters we know in early Christian history. The intermediary in this process of inviting the Roman army into the city was a member of the Herodian family called ‘Sautus’ or ‘Saul’. He is the one who delivered the message of call it ‘the Peace Coalition’ to the Roman army camped outside Jerusalem to enter, and a final report even to Nero’s headquarters, then in Corinth in Greece, a favourite haunt too of the religious activities of ‘Paul’. There will be more to say about this ‘Saul’ presently; he seems also to have been in Agrippa II’s palace or the Citadel when the Roman garrison surrendered and were all butchered except for the captain of the guard who agreed to be circumcised 

The anti-national, pro-Roman policy of the Pharisees should by now be clear. This is also the stance of the Pauline Gentile Christians, following the teaching of the person above, who even describes himself as having been trained as a Pharisee and, according to the picture in Acts anyhow, vaunts a Roman citizenship, something not easily acquired in these turbulent times. Nor can the Pharisees in this period by any twist of the imagination be considered ‘the popular party’. If anything, the Zealot and/or Messianic were the popular parties (as nationalist parties predictably are) at least until the fall of the Temple and the re-education policy undertaken by the heirs of the Pharisees under Roman suzerainty thereafter. 

? It is the rise of the Herodians and the coming of the Romans. This is the reason for the widespread disaffection being expressed in this period and most of the unrest. This is also the crucial factor for making chronological determinations where the Dead Sea Scrolls are concerned, if one attempts to date them by the internal parameters of what is being said and expressed in them, rather than by external ones such as archaeology, palaeography, or carbon testing, all inconclusive. This was the pivotal mistake in early research relating to them, encouraged by the cartel that previously governed Scroll publication - and the interpretation it disseminated. This error led to the widespread perception that ‘the Wicked Priest’ mentioned in the Scrolls - particularly in the commentaries or pesharim - and the Establishment he represented, against which the Scrolls so fulminate, were Maccabean. 


After the fall of the Temple the situation is unclear, because we have no Josephus to report it, and therefore we are without the tremendous detail he provides. It is against the backdrop of the fall of the Maccabeans and the rise of the Herodians in the first century BC, that the rise of various sects or movements, particularly nationalistic or Messianic ones, must be gauged. Again, if one keeps this and the fact of Roman power firmly before one’s eyes, then almost all else follows comparatively easily. 

First there was the Maccabean Revolution in 167 BC against the imposition of Syrian decrees and Hellenistic customs. These included hiding one’s circumcision, which of course so infuriated incipient Zealots, naked athletic events in a newly constructed gymnasium, and the introduction of idols on the Temple Mount, most particularly the Olympian Zeus, which via a distorted transliteration into the Hebrew turned into what now is called ‘the Abomination of the Desolation’.36 This struggle over Hellenization continued for the next two hundred and fifty years. It is neither accidental nor unimportant that Christianity in the form we know it represents its final triumph. 

This is moved along considerably by the imposition of Herodian rule and the Herodian or Pauline behaviour of being a Jew to the Jew, a Greek to the Greeks, ‘a Law-Breaker to the Law-Breakers, a Law-Keeper to the Law-Keepers’, that is, to do whatever was required, as Paul puts it in I Corinthians 9: 24, to ‘win ... not beat the air’. Here Paul uses the imagery of stadium athletics, deliberately calculated to send his interlocutors, like James’ Jerusalem Church ‘Zealots’ into paroxysms of rage. Herod, his putative forebear, as will be shown, believed most definitely in winning not beating the air. 

The Dead Sea Scrolls provide the counterpoint, as does James - that is, not ‘win at any costs’ but martyrdom. Certainly these movements are ‘old-fashioned’, with commitment to absolute purity, unbending Righteousness and uncompromising integrity, but this is perhaps their charm. In times where so much is so relative, there is something attractive about such above-board, totally honest and absolutely unyielding Piety and purity. There were no shades or reservations, no ifs, buts or temporizing. Everything is in the absolutely stark shades of Light or Dark, engagé, or, as Qumran eloquently puts it in numerous documents, ‘straight’, ‘not straying to the right or to the left’.37 If nothing else, their elegance, steadfastness and total commitment to absolute Righteousness cannot fail to impress the modern world as it rediscovers them. For his part, Paul pretends not to understand this ethos, or calls it ‘weak’ (Rom. 14:1ff. and I Cor. 14 :7ff.). Yet, complaining about attachment to circumcision, when Maccabean and Zealot martyrs for over two hundred and fifty years had laid down their lives rather than abjure it, is totally to close one’s eyes to the driving forces in Palestine throughout this period. These are admirably summed up in the Maccabee Books, missing, not surprisingly, from the Jewish canon as it ultimately came down to us. Josephus, too, depicts ample examples of this ethos and the countless martyrs it produced long before martyrdom became prototypical of the ethos that Christianity claimed for itself. 

117

ust as Caesar was making his inroads into Transalpine Gaul, the Rhine, Britain, and Spain in the West, Pompey was undertaking the siege of Jerusalem in 63 BC. He was abetted in this by internal dissensions within the Maccabean family itself, but also by a half-Arab, Hellenized intermediary by the name of Antipater, the father of Herod. 

n the end, Herod even had his two sons by her - who had been brought up in Rome - put to death, presumably because he was jealous of their Maccabean blood and because the crowd preferred them to him. Here Herod really did kill all the Jewish children who sought to replace him, as Matthew 2:17 would have it, but these were rather his own children with Maccabean blood! This behaviour even shocked his Roman sponsors, particularly Augustus, who upheld family values and was by all reports very displeased with it.3 

Josephus pathetically records how, when the boy at thirteen years of age donned the High Priestly vestments, the Jewish crowd wept when he appeared in the Temple.40 For those who would still cling to the contention that the people considered the Maccabean family usurpers, this should provide vivid testimony to the contrary. Wild with jealousy, Herod then had the boy taken down to his winter palace in Jericho and drowned while frolicking in the swimming pool with some of his attendants. He was the last Maccabean High Priest. 

After this, Herod is careful to maintain personal contol over the High Priestly garments and appoints men, as Josephus himself observes, ‘who were not of eminent families, some hardly priests at all’.41 Once instituted, this was the policy followed by procurators such as Pontius Pilate after him (26- 37)42 and kings such as Agrippa I, his brother Herod of Chalcis, and his son, Bernice’s brother Herod Agrippa II, until the Uprising against Rome. At this time ‘the Zealots’ elected their own High Priest, a lowly stone-cutter of the humblest origins whom Josephus calls ‘Phannius’, that is, Phineas. Such were the bloody origins of the Herodian High Priest class, tendentiously portrayed in the New Testament as the legitimate ‘Chief Priests’ and Sadducee party of the Jews! 

Actually, it continued for the next hundred and forty years until Hadrian crushed the Second Jewish Revolt in 132-6 CE and renamed Jerusalem Aelia Capitolina after his forename Aelius. He forbade Jews to enter Jerusalem or even to come within eyesight of it, except once a year to mourn its past glories. During this period, too, descendants of the family of Jesus and his brothers were involved in ongoing Messianic agitation and were martyred in their turn. This was the end of the earthbound Messianic hopes among the Jews, hopes that gradually turned more other-worldly, ethereal, or ‘Gnostic’. This is what the imposition of Roman control really meant - destruction

We have already seen how these events transpired. First there was the Maccabean Revolution in 167 BC against the imposition of Syrian decrees and Hellenistic customs. These included hiding one’s circumcision, which of course so infuriated incipient Zealots, naked athletic events in a newly constructed gymnasium, and the introduction of idols on the Temple Mount, most particularly the Olympian Zeus, which via a distorted transliteration into the Hebrew turned into what now is called ‘the Abomination of the Desolation’.36 This struggle over Hellenization continued for the next two hundred and fifty years. It is neither accidental nor unimportant that Christianity in the form we know it represents its final triumph.

            <Title>White Tails</Title>
            <Text>One morning they came across a herd of white-tails one-thousand strong. More commonly known as poop-tails. Mandri asked Obo why they shat on their tails, because Obo had an answer for everything. Obo said that when it gets too hot—and it always gets too hot—poop-tail lizards cup their webbed hind feet and then evacuate their cloacal contents onto them, allowing them to rub their tails in it, and they do this so that when they raise their tails into the air and open them up like sails, the liquid from their piss-shit gets sucked up by the sun, and in so doing, it draws the heat from the body.
Seb overheard this explanation and said, “That’s just like garglin’ urine to wet the throat.”
Mandri didn’t even cringe at the thought. When the heat dries out the throat it gets scratchy.
This time spent in this wilderness was acquainting him well with his body’s functions, because the body is all there was out there. Nothing about it was disgusting. Mandri worried that if found Seb’s behavior to be tolerable, he himself must look outlandish. Yes, he was turning into a regular outland poke.

            <Title>Lyotard</Title>
            <Text>He is against consensus. The more we reach consensus, the more we are under the secret and hidden constraints of totalizing meta-narratives. He thinks that Habermas’ project of founding a moralizing choices reached on consensus is based upon something that is totalitarian and modernist.

‘’’’He is firmly against categorization, which puts him firmly in the anti-establishement category’’’

Now that these meta-narratives are gone, what do we replace them with? If legitimzation relies on grand narrative, then it is not possible. But how is it possible to criticize political life without making some kind of affirmation? There’s some double-dealing here - relentless negation, with soft, circmscribed commitment to some kind of positive affirmation. He has not figured out how we go about affirming propositions about politics and ethics and so on

Wittgenstein - language games - language doesn’t have the tools to be able to explore truth values. Instead we have overlapping language games - pragmatic interaction between the two. So Lyotard’s focus on little narratives as opposed to grand narratives reinforces the message that there is no essence to language, only a set of social pragmatics. This undermines the claims of positivism as a universal standard, a universal litmus test by which we judge the communication.

In trying to generate a consensus, you are forcing a totalitarian, stultifying, uncreative myth on people who really have no grounds for generating this consesus. Consensus defies jsutice. Prevents alternative kinds of speech and thought from proliferating and blooming. If you are in possession of the absolute truth the ultimate glyph of reality, then that means you should cut no one any slack because that means that other people can only be mistaken and wrong. That is what’s been wrong with western culture since the time of plato. All totalitarian discourses gesture at silencing all other discourses. They are ‘terroristic’.  Habermas’ attempt to resurrect ‘human rationalism’ is complicit in the totalitarian discourses of the modern age. Lyotard wishes to lead us out of that wilderness towards a domain of human freedom. A land where we resist the totalitarian inclination to silence the other, silence the differend. The more you undercut these human discourses, the more you truncate the human domain of freedom and the creative breakthroughs of tomorrow.

It is a philosophy of resistance, a philosophy of negation. It resists and negates the modernist tendency to subsume all thought under one aegis.

A new goal for political life - to maximize difference. To celebrate diversity. Diversity is an intrinsically good thing, and the more of it you have, the better it is. Any attempt to restrict this, to silence someone who is generating an alternative discourse, is to terrorize that person. It is an unjust and oppressive activity. This is a discourse which legitimizes a philosophy of difference. 

You can’t use one of these language games as a priveleged position from which to judge all the others. They’re all on the same level. We’re stuck here on the earth with finitude, contingency, an infinite number of mutually irreconcilable language games.

Citicizes systems theory. Hates deterministic. Modernizing, totalizing, meta-narrative. There is a hidden agenda built in - legitimizing performativity. Performativity is the value that is built into advanced capitalism. Maximum output for minimum input. An ideology of efficiency. All capitalistic systems operate this way. The efficiency is intrinsically rational, and self-justifying. Lyotard says its not - its an ideological construct which can only be taken seriously as a totalizing meta-narrative. Perfmormativity is just another one of those coercive myths. 

How do we get out from under performativity? Be irrational? Counter performative? Lyotard says, look, there’s no such thing as a scientific method (borrowing from Kuhn) - there’s one paradigm and another, but it has no internal logical coherence. It’s a set of pragmatic activities which works or it doesn’t. If there is no method to science, how should we investigate science and its claims to performativity, and its connection to the legitimization of science and the legitimization of the modern state?  He says, instead of looking at the theory, look at the practice. Science has caught us up in performativity - Lyotard advocates for parology - counter logos, counter speech, counter thinking. Infinite plurality of stances, none which can make a claim of being better than any other.

Give a new goal for science - use to be an attempt to describe the world - can’t do that anymore. Now the goal of science is to increase the number of alternative discourses about the world to give us the maximum number of discourses about the world. That’s what parology means - a paralogical science. Science made free, opens us up to the possiblity that there are other, legitimate ways of looking at the world. The valorization of marginality. It takes discourses which have been marginalized and says, they’re just as good as any other kind of discourse. 

How to legitimize anything?

Abortion discourse - 35:32
There is no netural middle ground where you can dispassionately and objectively search for knowledge. Where is the middle ground? Perhaps nowhere. Perhaps the desire to do it is an atavistic hold over from our modernist history.


Democracy presumes no one has the absolute truth. 

Socrates and the sophists have different assumptions about the world, and they’re talking past eachother. 

Just Gaming - is it possible to use the paralogical approach as a legitimizing force. Ending of the book - doesn’t have an answer - ethics - judgment without criteria. Ends in laughter.

Postmodern -undoes binary distinctions. A posture of studied suspicion.

            <Text>Her finished product required a little more finishing. But 

Mandri would have laughed, but the man was being serious, and the man was who he was.
Mandri briefly considered walking away, but soon he found himself asking, against his better judgment, “Why don’t you like the piece?”
“And who are you?” The general said. Mandri told the general he kept the place clean, and that seemed to placate the scar on the old man’s lip. The general went on to say, “It makes a mockery of war. Whoever painted this has never seen a battle. If you described to a child what happened in the Goriol Valley, and had them paint it, this is what you’d get. Obviously, it’s much prettier than what a child could do, but what this is—it is childish.”
Mandri smirked, the general noticed, and the man drew up such reserves of contempt that Mandri wondered if the man was about to shout for an arrest. Generals still had that kind of power, even if the ascent of the Mazidai had long made battlefield tactics obsolete.
\

Mandri was bothered by the General’s critique. He thought Fremel had handled the subject seriously. The scene was gruesome, but not obscenely so. 
Mandri was bothered by the General’s critique—what could be childish about a mound of bodies? 

 He’d seen dead bodies but only in the singular, and there was nothing profound about them. 

Then again, Fremell wasn’t at the Goriol valley and she’d never seen a hill of corpses. Neither had Mandri. 

“Let me see those,” said Moteah. The sinuous Zosan woman came stalking up behind Mandri, and was pointing at Tob’s pouches of rocks. She, out of all the Ayramun, seemed least affected by the great mound of death rotting just twenty yards away. She’d said, ‘let me see them’, but it was clear she had no intention of giving them back.
She said, “Those rocks don’t belong to you.”
“Why not?” Mandri asked. “Tob doesn’t need them.”
Moteah held out her hand and said, “Give me those rocks.”
Seb had been idling nearby like a dried out lizard. And the miserable lout was drawn to conflict like a dog to puke, so when Moteah’s tone got serious his whole body perked up, and in a flash he knew how best to get involved.
“Let the boy have the stones,” he said. “Not like you’ll use ‘em.”
“He hardly knew Tob.”
“Like that matters. An’ it’s not like you cared about him.”
“What would you know, Seb?”
“I heard you call him a greaseless pushcart. Thems cruel words.” Seb’s manner was thick as usual, and he was still chewing on a spine. “An’ besides, if Tob didn’t want the boy to have ‘em, then they wouldn’t have been there for him to take.”
Moteah rolled her eyes and walked off. Seb was more than she could bear. Unfortunately, the little exchange had gotten Seb up and moving, and Mandri knew enough about the man to know that once that happened, shooing him away would be a task.

Seb said, “That demon woman you said you saw, what’d she look like?”
“I thought you said not to talk about her.”
“Now come on, what’d she look like?”
“She was old.”
“That all?”
“She had a large nose. And her teeth were whiter than salt.”
“She was skinny?”
“I know her name if you want it.”
“She told you her name?” Seb asked in wonder.
“She said it was Pell.”
The sound of the name, Pell, stirred Seb’s face into a confused spate of expressions that Mandri couldn’t quite place. It was almost like Seb was jealous and was trying to tamp it down.
“Say it again?” asked Seb.
“She said her name was Pell.”
Upon hearing this confirmation, Seb settled himself down and tried to act normal, which for him meant spitting out his spine and pulling a new one out of his sleeve. He twiddled it, then put it back in his pocket.
“An’ where did you see her?” he asked.
“This was right before you people found me. I was sitting on my farm outside of Meskalim.”
“What’d you talk about?”
“I wasn’t really paying attention. She wanted to know if I still had my uglies.”
Seb’s eyes flicked down to Mandri’s groin.
“You ain’t got your uglies?”
“No, I do.”
“So, you bunched up with Pell, and here you are, still breathin’?”
“I don’t know what ‘bunched up’ means, but yes, I’ve been trying to tell you this, I’ve been lucky.”
“No, you don’t get it. You ain’t just lucky. Pell ain’t no demon.”
“But I saw her—”
“You saw shit. You don’t know shit. You been out here, whinin’ about this an’ that and all the big stuff that ain’t killed you, but let me tell you what—those words you had with that woman on that farm were the biggest words of your life. You don’t even know it. You don’t even remember them. You think you can see what’s goin’ on but I can tell you—you can’t see shit.”
“Then enlighten me.”
“I shouldn’t. Pell an’ our Elrahet, they’re like sisters, an’ there ain’t no hate like the hate sisters can get for each other. Damn, I warned you. You really shoulda kept it all to yourself.”
“Pell and Elrahet know each other?”
“If I were you, I wouldn’t pull that thread.”
“Why not?”
“What did I just say, huh?”


“But there’s a thing you should know about Mandri here. About what kind of things he been up to.”

he tried against sense to brush her wet cloth free of the dirt it was building up. Recent events had worked her up into a tizzy, more than usual. She snapped at Mandri, who still carried Obo, and said, “Put it next to the other one.”

Seb said, “Mandri saw Pell the day afore he found us.”
Mandri’s gut dropped like a stone as all eyes turned to him.
“Did he?” Ayram asked, glaring over his shoulder. He swiveled around in his stool to face the news. His bread-loaf beard was greased in blood, giving him the appearance of having drunk it. He leaned forward, giant elbows on giant knees, and said, “Explain yourself.”
Mandri took a deep breath.
“Well,” he said, “Can I just say, I’m not personally invested in whatever’s going on here. I’m a poor farmer who likes burgeons, and somehow…I don’t know—somehow you all found me and now we’re all out here.”
Seb picked up the slack, saying, “Think of what Mandri survived so far. Sure seem like he been touched by the hand of Pell, don’t he? And look what we’ve done—stood him up from the dead. Plus, he said Pell was askin’ bout his uglies.”
“He’s shriven?” Ayram asked.
Mandri opened his mouth to explain, but stopped when the old witch Elrahet intruded.
“You said you’re a farmer?” she asked. 
“Uh, yeah. Legumes, mostly. I turned to barley more recently, because, you know, everyone needs bread, don’t they?”
All three of the Ayramun regarded him with suspicion. Elrahet most of all. She stepped right up to him, stared him down, and her brown, glinting eyes worked him over.
“I should have known,” she declared after sniffing him. “I can smell the Black on you. I put it off ‘cause who doesn’t smell like Black these days, but you, it comes on strong, like you’ve been swimming in it.”
“What do we do with him?” Seb asked.
Ayram caught Mandri’s ogling eye and said, “Are you evil, boy?”
Mandri was quick to say, “Not any more or less than any other man. I like to think that I’m a good person.”
Mandri tried his best to sound confident, but knew he should have been even more assertive. Seb was standing there grinning, like a thief watching his rival get caught.
“Is he tainted?” Ayram asked his witch.
Elrahet answered ,“He’s not at risk of sprouting scales.”
She then tossed her wet rag to Ayram, picked up her short cane, and began to pace around in a little circle. As she walked she scuffed the dirt with the toes of her sandals, kicking puffs of sand out in front of her. Eventually she declared, “The bitch is as powerless as we are, but time turns in her favor. She’s got Schisol’s idiots stirring, and if she’s haunting stoops in Meskalem, that means she’s working up to something big.” When she stopped she stabbed her cane into the sand and declared, “We have to keep trying. As for the boy, we could use another pair of hands. He won’t fight us. He smells of Black, but he doesn’t have the stomach for it.”
“Course he doesn’t,” Seb said. “I coulda told you that.”
“So could I,” said Mandri, but no one appreciated this clumsy stab at meekness.



Obo shook his head and said, “Your choice of Purl as Minder was a poor one. You should have gone with yourself—you might be a capable Minder, but that’s only a ‘might be’, and I suppose you don’t want to lose your hand for no good reason, if it would even fit in my chest. The only other option would be the witch here, Elrahet. I’m actually quite certain she’d be able to do it. I don’t understand why you didn’t use her in the first place.”
“She needs her hands.”
“In that case, it’s either hope Purl magically develops some resolve, or, and this was always possible, treat with me. 


If you give me something which overwhelms my allegiance to Solraheen, I would betray Him.”
“What is it you want?”
“What I want is something that elegantly solves the problem of the Mazidariga, and that’s why I know you’ll do it, because an elegant solution demands implementation.”
“Get on with it,” Ayram grumbled.

It’s safe to assume that Jeket is crawling with Mazidariga, so even if Purl could control me, the Riga will discover me long before we reach Solraheen’s chamber. But if you give me what I want, none of this will be a problem.”


“I said get on with it.”
“I want my freedom. I want my own bright and willful Spark. I want to be sustained by me, and me alone. If I had my own share of the divine, then it stands to reason that I would be freed from the Mazidariga’s hunt, and I would be freed from a Minder’s influence. In return for this grand gesture, I would do anything you wish, even if it went against my own baser instinct. I would work to undo what Solraheen has done.”
Ayram stroked his beard, unbothered by the fact it bloodied his fingers.
“How do I get you a Spark?”
“Did you not give me this will-less Spark that I have now?”
“That was your own,” said Elrahet. “I merely retrieved it from the Riga’s body.”

“As you say, we are different creatures. Don’t project your own failings onto me.” 
Elrahet snarled and Ayram laughed.

I don’t know this for certain, but I assume that when the Mazidariga whistled the will-less Spark out of my body, I became, in a sense, invisible to the Riga. 

Ayram wiped a small circle of sand flat with his booted foot. “How far out are they?” he asked Obo. 
“If we are where I think we are, then it's a two day march from the nearest outpost at Shahiz.”
“Shahiz…” Ayram mumbled as he drew a crude map of southwest Jandri in the dirt with his spear.
Obo added, “Once the Hrks discover that I am still on the loose, and that the Riga they sent is dead, the troops at Shahiz will be the least of your worries. ”
“How long will it take for them to figure all that out?”
“For all I know, they already know. But once they do figure it out, every Hrkan captain from here to the eastern sea will be stirring. You’ve kicked the largest ant hill this world has ever seen. The Lords are not one to let a weapon such as me go missing.”
Ayram finished drawing the map of Jandri and began to pace around it. If Mandri felt he was allowed to speak he would have offered to make it a little more presentable. 
“Where is the nearest Hrkan outpost to Luqr?” Ayram asked.
“There’s a garrison in Luqr itself,” Obo answered.
“Since when?”
“Last summer.”
“I don’t believe you,” Ayram declared.
“Believe what you want, I’m not lying,” said Obo.
Ayram held Obo’s gaze for a moment, but eventually accepted the news and added a dot and an arrow to his map. Elrahet’s robe brushed right through it all as she marched right up to Ayram. By now she was a bottled up old bag of frustration. She said through clenched teeth, “I thought you said you wouldn’t trust its word.”</Text>

            <Text>A man who expects too much sets out into the Sand alone. Unbeknown to him, a woman who expects too little sets out from the opposite direction. The two travelers happen to cross paths in the shifting middle of the Sand’s Empty Portion. They are hundreds of leagues from any farm or road, hundreds of years from anyone ever setting foot in that spot of the world again. It’s an unlikely convergence in space and time, in the most inhospitable desert, yet the man who expects too much will doubt the significance of this meeting. He actually expects to find a bit of strangeness out in the great sand sea—after all, the desert is large but the world is small and full of chance encounters. 
He looks at the woman who he has stumbled upon and all he can see is the fulfillment of expectation. That is all this meeting is to the man who expects too much. No need to invoke the name of Solraheen.
The other traveler, the woman who expects too little, is stunned by the significance of the moment. She did not expect to see another person in a place where no one else should be. After all, this part of the Sand is large and full of nothing. For this to happen, for two Sparks to meet in such a wasteland without intending to, well, it could not be a simple coincidence. She and he must have been brought together for some purpose.
Overwhelmed by this glimpse of the divine plan, she turns her eyes to the heavens and invokes the name of Solraheen.
The story ends there. It is nine long lines in the original Old Jandri script, nine lines scratched into an old clay tablet the size of a washing board. Some say the ending is missing, that there is another tablet hidden in a secret vault of some ancient city buried by time, waiting for providence to be revealed. Solitants preach that there must be another tablet, one which proves that the story is about Solraheen Himself. They say Solraheen is the man who expects too little. The woman is his bride. It is the story of their meeting.
But what do they know?
They’re freaks. Maybe that man was just a man and the woman was just a woman and that’s all there is to it. That’s what Seb Ugluu believed. Sometimes she’d dare to venture even further and say that the man and woman never existed at all and that the story is a fable.
She’d tell anyone who’d listen to her liquored up sermons that this story, the raw events, were not important. What was important was the lesson, and there was a lesson in those nine lines, a lesson that’s made easier to see by asking a few simple questions:
 What would have happened if the woman had journeyed into the desert and made it through safely without encountering a single Spark? 
Absolutely nothing. 
And if nothing had happened, would she have glimpsed the divine plan? 
Absolutely not.
She would have trudged along the ridges of the ergs, her shoulder set against the wind, head downcast, and she wouldn’t have given a single thought to Solraheen except to pray for her safety.
She never would have been overwhelmed by His mysteries.
She never would have shed a tear at the wonder of chance.
She never would have turned her eyes to the heavens and laced His name with magnificence.
And yet, Solraheen would have been there all the same. Solraheen’s hand is there and it is always there. It is there in the meeting, and it is there in the absence of it. It is there in the pain, and it is there in the pleasure. To be struck dumb by the sight of His plan in one instance and not the other is the same as to not see the plan at all. 
The key was to avoid expectations. Expectations turn the vividness of the present moment into an ignorable blur. 
Seb liked to put it a little more bluntly, “Expectations will get ya up the ass.”
She said it, and that’s how it was.
Of course, none of this stopped her from having expectations herself. No one is perfect. Not even Solraheen.
Seb was something of a mistress of low expectations, because thirty years of living in a desert land that most languages call Emptiness made it easy to keep expectations as low as possible.
Like clouds. Seb did not expect to see clouds. This close to the coast one might have expected to see a bit of moisture pluming the sky but Seb knew better. She knew how the Hias mountains shadowed the Junei hills from rain, how the Istil wind was too weak to carry water up and over those peaks. It was strange because the Hias were hardly mountains at all. The Burgos mountains, those were mountains, fully grown mountains with bald heads and stern granite faces frowning at pilgrims passing by. The Hias were nothing but big mounds of dirt pimpled with boulders. Chins tufted with thornscrub. The weakest watering wind should be able to make it up and over them.
The winds used to be able to do it, in some ancient age. The evidence was there in the foothills. She’d walked the ridges of the Hias and she’d looked east towards the Junei Plain where she could see the lighter orange clay of long-dried washes snaking through the red foothills for as far as there were foothills.
Of course, when she was down in those foothills she never noticed the washes. Down there she’d only seen sun baked clay and that clay was so hard that she couldn’t imagine it had ever seen rain. One night, Seb spit on the ground and when she woke, five whole hands later, that glob of spit was still there. The ground was so hard her spit couldn’t seep into it. Some of that might have to do with the fact that Seb’s spit was thick and sticky from all the borcandi spines she chewed, but still, it proved the point. It was like the ground had been dry for so long that it didn’t want to get wet. Like that story of the lonesome spearman who’d been at war for so long that when he returned home to the kindness of his wife he killed her. Just couldn’t deal with good loving. The Hias hills were like that. A lot of the Sand was like that. Hateful. Nothing lived in it.
Absolutely nothing.
There were lizards, but lizards were everywhere so they didn’t count. Piss on a rock, any rock, and some little lizard will scuttle out from nowhere to sip the urine. 
Birds didn’t count either because they’re only passing through. 
Beetles could be found by ripping the waxy bark off bamber trees. Sometimes Seb would have to bore all the way into the tree’s stringy, yellow core to find them. But green crust beetles don’t count as ‘something’. The problem with them is their shells guard a smell that makes the stomach curl, and that smell can’t be boiled or steamed, so they aren’t good eating, and as far as Seb was concerned, if it’s not good eating it might as well not exist. The only things worth paying any mind are things that kill and the things that keep alive, and those beetles were neither.
Everything else is nothing. 
There’s men out in the Sand, but men are boring. There’s women, but that’s all Seb would say about them—they’re out there. There were other things too, but mostly there was nothing. 
That’s what Seb saw as she stood atop one of the Junei foothills and looked out over the red and empty Junei plain—she saw nothing. Mostly she saw nothing because her eyes weren’t good at seeing way far out. Way far out was mostly a blur. But even if she could see, she knew there wouldn’t be a horizon because it’d be lost in the shimmer of a mirage, the kind that looks like water only it's not. A mirage was the perfect metaphor for how Seb viewed the Sand, because it looked like something, but really, it was nothing.
Lots and lots of nothing.
“Ey, Seb! There's somethin ‘ere!”
Seb’s ears pricked at the words. The shout had come from a nearby ravine.
Quick and spry as a lizard zipped up on spikeweed, Seb scrambled over to the lip of that ravine and peered down into its deep belly. One of her fellows was standing in the middle of it. All the Ayramun were swaddled from head to toe in brown or black wool dusted red by clay, but Seb knew it was Gugi down there because of the way he stood. Only Seb and Gugi stood with that twitchy restlessness that marks out a Jandri poke who’s not stopped chewing the spines of borcandi leaves since the day they were weaned off the tit. And Gugi was also a little taller than most. A little lankier. 
Gugi stuck his skinny arm up in the air and waved it towards Seb.
Seb sneered at his eagerness.
“Put your goddamned hand down,” Seb shouted. “I can see ya just fine.”
“Then get your ass down here!” Gugi shouted back.
Seb harrumphed, then started her climb down into the ravine.
As far as ravines go it seemed as full of nothing as any other ravine. It was steeper than most, and it was dry and dusty so Seb struggled to find purchase on the slope. She was forced into a clumsy half-scramble-half-slide to get down the bottom, which was about thirty yards down. Once there she took a moment to shake out the dirt that had fallen into her left boot.
The unexpected thing about this ravine was how even and straight it was, almost like a road. It went straight as an arrow for a full fifty yards before getting lost around a bend. This run was speckled with big dried out husks of karkle bushes. Gugi was standing in front of one of them, looking a little spooked.
Seb took her time ambling on over. She fingered a fresh borcandi spine out of her sleeve pocket as she went. She knew there wouldn’t be anything worth noticing because Gugi had a penchant for pointing out any old thing that caught his interest. Maybe there’d be a pricked-up drag-belly hissing inside that bush, but fat little lizards doing four-legged push-ups and flashing their ruddy throats weren’t worth shouting about. 
They weren’t something.
They were to be expected.
Part of the ignorable blur.
Gugi urged her on with an impatient flap of his hand. 
Seb laughed. “I ain’t gonna run in this heat.”
Gugi shook his head and mumbled something Seb couldn’t hear. 
“Pipe down, white light, I’m comin’.”
Seb eyed the karkle bush. There was definitely something hidden underneath its twiggy branches. A lumpy shape of something shadowed. Maybe a creature of some sort. Whatever it was, it was big, dark, unmoving, and apparently unconcerned with how Gugi was brushing the karkle’s branches aside to get a better look. 
“What is it?” Seb asked as she crouched next to Gugi.
“See for yourself,” Gugi said as he parted the bush’s brambles.
Seb peered down into the bush’s shadow. Her jaw went slack in surprise, and her barely-chewed borcandi spine slipped from her lip.
“Schisol’s shadow,” she muttered. 
There was a skeleton underneath that damned bush.
“Shit.”
“Ain’t it?” Gugi said, eyes open wide in frightened wonder. “Ya know, this is the first bush I looked under.”
“No. The first one?”
“Yep. It’s the first bush I looked under. I was like, this bush is in the perfect position, halfway-up, halfway-down, bet it will be the best spot to—”
“You sayin’ this is the first bush you looked under?”
“Yep.”
Gugi’s eyes weren’t lying. It was the first bush he’d looked under. There were at least forty other bushes in that dusty ravine, and the first one Gugi looks under has got a man missing muscles and skin. A quick glance around at the other bushes told Seb it was the only one that had something like this hiding inside.
This was really something.
A strange coincidence.
A divine sign.
Seb’s skin prickled.
She picked up her dropped borcandi spine, popped it back into her mouth, and resumed chewing with zeal. It was a little sandy, but Seb wasn’t going to waste a spine. Spines helped her think. They helped her find reasonable conclusions.
This body could be a prank.
She eyed Gugi with suspicion, for Gugi was a prankster. He had a prankster’s face—thin, with a long crooked nose and restless eyes. Bad skin, too. Mostly it was in the way he chewed his spines, open-mouthed, provocative, sigh-smiling. It was nasty, the way he chewed, because the man’s teeth were rubbed down to black and yellow nubs. Seb’s teeth were just the same, but she had the good sense to keep her mouth shut. Even when she talked, her lips worked hard to conceal the graveyard in her mouth.
Gugi said, “Ain’t fresh. And it don’t smell.”
“No shit it don’t smell. Thems picked clean.”
Gugi started playing a game of point-and-see, like he was want to do.
“Got an arm,” he said. “Both hands too, but they all scattered. Not a lick of skin.”
Seb rolled her eyes and squatted down to get away from Gugi’s inane observations. She peered under the low brim of the karkle’s branches.
“Gotta be a man,” she said.
Gugi squatted down next to Seb. “Help me get him out,” he said.
Seb noticed the ground around the bush was stepped on. She set an accusing eye on Seb and asked, “Did you put these bones here?”
“What? No.”
“Gugi. I’m only gonna ask one more time. Did you put these bones here?”
Seb couldn’t read Gugi’s face. The man was too well practiced in deceit. Only sometimes did Gugi’s eyes give things away, and this wasn’t one of those times.
“You think I’d kidnap some random bit’s bones, haul them all the way out here, then stuff ‘em up under this bush, just to stir you up?”
Gugi’s eyes still weren’t telling. Sometimes, if Seb paused and stared hard at Gugi, the guilt would get to him, and he’d give it up. 
“I didn’t do shit! Damn. I found it here like I said.”
“Then who put it here? Ain’t nobody jus’ crawl up under a random bush and die.”
“Could be a pilgrim,” Gugi replied. “He’s prolly some pilgrim that was headed for the pass. Crawled up under here to seek shade and forgot to wake up.”
“If that’s what happened, it’s even worse.”
“Why’s that?”
“Because it means a god put him here.”
“Gods are all dead.”
“Could mean a demon put it here. It’s what we call providence, one way or the other. Could be a curse.”
“It ain’t no curse. It’s jus’ bones.”
“There’s no such thing as ‘jus’ bones’. This goes with what I been sayin’ this whole time—we shouldn’t be settin’ up this damn ambush in these Spark scrubbin’ hills.”
“If it’s a curse, then let’s move it somewhere else, because I aim to use this bush. It’s the perfect spot.”
Seb couldn’t believe her ears. “You gonna hide in this bush?”
“I am,” said Gugi, without a hint of trepidation.
“You gonna hide in the one bush that’s got dead bones in it?”
“There won’t be no bones when we move ‘em. That’s why I need your help. Damn.” 
&quot;You lost your water? This the clearest shout of a cursed bush I ever heard. And more in point of fact, Ayram ought to hear about this. ‘Cause if this is the place where—&quot;
&quot;Don't worry Ayram ‘bout this shit. Jus’ help me move the damn thing.”
“Gugi, how do you not see what’s goin’ on here?”
“Grab his foot.”
“Gugi, listen to me—this here is Solraheen tellin’ you that if you hide in this bush, then you gonna die.”
“Grab his foot.”
“No.”
“I grab one, you grab the other.”
Gugi reached down and took a firm grip of the biggest bone in the dead left foot. He pulled it out and tossed it up and down. As he did, he said to Seb, “You know this body here—this body is the perfect chance for you to get to bother Elrahet.”
“How’s that?”
“You don’t think an old witch don’t want to look over a nice set of clean white bones? I bet if you bring a few bones with you, now you got something to pester her with instead of your boring old self. Put a skull in her lap, and she’ll forget to shoo you away.”
“Maybe,” Seb said hesitantly.
“Help me carry the bones to Elrahet, and I’ll give you twenty spines.”
The furrow in Seb’s brow softened. “Twenty?”
Gugi nodded. “Twenty.”
Twenty was a lot of spines. A couple weeks worth. There was no telling when they’d be back in the putty hills and she could pick another fill.
“How about it?” Gugi asked.
“Alright.”
Seb bent down to gather up the rest of the foot, but Gugi brushed her away, saying, “I’ll make it forty spines if you carry it all yourself.”
“You ain’t got forty spines.”
“I’ll give you twenty spines, and my God’s Eye burgeons.”
“Give me twenty spines, and you tell me where you get your God’s Eye burgeons.”
“No chance. It’s twenty and the burgeons, and you carry this bit all the way to Ayram. Or Elrahet. Or whoever.”
“I ain’t got a bag.”
“I do.”
Gugi pulled the strap of his slump-shouldered bag over his head, and emptied out a bunch of little nothings into the dirt.
Seb asked, “If you don’t think it’s cursed, then what you givin’ up your burgeons’ for? Carry it yourself.”
“I don’t wanna carry it.”
Seb’s brow tightened up again. “Why not?”
Gugi smiled. “Because it’s cursed.”
This was why no one liked Gugi—he was never upfront about the way things were. He’d betray anyone he could, if anyone ever thought to trust him. Seb was near to slapping him. “You thought you could get me to take up this cursed body for a measly twenty spines and some God’s Eye burgeons?”
“Am I wrong?”
Gugi’s face twisted into that annoying, presumptuous grin. Seb wanted nothing more than to break some of Ayram’s rules on that grin, but she thought better of it. Best thing to do was to take the grand scheme of things into account.
There were cursed bones under a bush, where no cursed bones should be. 
Maybe she was looking at this all wrong.
Maybe them bones wasn’t cursed.
Solraheen’s hand is there in the pain, and it’s there in the pleasure. A curse could be a blessing, and a blessing could be a curse. There’s no way of knowing which is which until it all plays out. It’s expectations that get in the way of seeing the divine plan. If she looked at all this with no expectations, and abstracted out the deadness of the bones from the strangeness of the circumstances, then no doubt she would take Gugi’s deal. God’s Eye burgeons for a little bit of toil? 
The best thing to do was to take the deal.
She said to Gugi, “You ain’t wrong, but dammit, you know I’m gonna kill you someday.” 
“Sure thing, Seb.”
“Before we do anythin’, you’re gonna gimme them burgeons.”
“I’ll give you the spines now, and the burgeons later.”
“Burgeons now, spines later.”
Gugi sighed, then pulled out a leather pouch from his robe and tossed it to Seb. Seb caught it, checked it, pocketed it, and then she crouched down, reached under the karkle’s twigs, and started swiping the bones up into the bag. The bigger bones she had to handle fresh on the skin of her palms, which was disconcerting, but it was over before she knew it. She didn’t stick around for Gugi’s mocking laugh. She took her haul back west, towards the Junei pass, towards the cliff where Ayram and Elrahet were planning out the ambush that would hopefully end all their ambushes for good. She didn’t know why they needed to know about these bones, but she knew they needed to know. They needed to know because she felt like they needed to know.
Even if they didn’t need to know, she was going to do what she wanted to do, and that was how things were.</Text>

            <Text>The Trader stopped pacing. His companion unhooked a camel whip from his belt of linked precious stones and snapped the thong. The man’s dogs, caged for safety, howled and threw themselves against the woven goathide straps of their prison. In the pen beside them the man’s goats bleated and milled, dropping anxious balls of shit, yellow slot-eyes gleaming.

“Is she blooded?” he asked, glancing over his shoulder at the man.
“Since four godmoons.”
“Intact?”
The man nodded. “Of course.”
The Trader’s lip curled. “There is no ‘of course’ where men and she-flesh abide.”
Without warning he plunged his hand between her legs, fingers pushing, probing, higher up, deeper in. Teeth bared, her own fingers like little claws, the child flew at him, screeching. Her chains might have weighed no more than the bangles on his slender, elegant wrists. The man sprang forward shouting, fists raised, face contorted, but the Trader did not need him. He brushed her aside as though she were a corn-moth. Seizing a handful of black and tangled hair he wrenched her to the tips of her toes till she was screaming in pain, not fury, and her hands fell limply by her sides. She felt her heart batter her brittle ribs and despair storm in her throat. Her eyes squeezed shut and for the first time she could remember felt the salty sting of tears.
But the Trader was laughing. Still holding her, he turned to his friend. “What a little hell-cat! Untamed and savage, like all these dwellers in the savage north. But do you see the eyes, Yagji? The face? The length of bone and the sleekness of flank? Her sweet breasts, budding?”

Her eyes popped as the sticky gold honey melted on her tongue.


Wearing shells of hardened leather on their ppper bodies. In the middle of their leather chests was a hunting bird picked out in stones of lowsun fire, and plaited into their charm-heavy godbrainds waved long red feathers banded thickly with black. Leather thongs dangled round their necks, threaded with rattling, bouncing fingerbones. 

Pulling a face

Black striped horsehide. On his head wore a horse skull with horns.


“Business!” the Gatekeeper barked, like a dog. He had so many protections set in his teeth his lips wouldn’t close properly over them.

His eyes were hot, they had no whites, they glowed yellow in the shade beneath the dagger-tooth gates.

Risked a look through her lowered lashes.

            <Title>Shis</Title>
            <Text>Mandri did not have to look long for an unnatural hole which might lead down to Shis, as there was one in the cluttered study that lay adjacent to the throne room.
The king’s study.
Greskal’s study.
The man must have found some dark grimoire that lured him to seek succor in Shis. Or so Mandri supposed. Finding that book would be difficult, as it seemed every book in the room had its spine cut and its innards loosed, and sheets of paper were scattered about like moon moths. Some were stuck to the walls. Some alighted on the large upturned table that lay canted on the far side of the room, its legs sticking up like a bloated cow. Some paper fluttered on the rim of a shield-sized hole in the center of the floor. A green carpet hung down into that hole’s depths, a carpet ripped to rags by a track of claw marks. Ascending claw marks, judging from the direction of the rip.
Moto dropped his torch down into this hole, revealing a red rock floor some few meters away.
“This should be fun,” said Obo. Mandri agreed. He felt invincible with Obo staring over his shoulder, though he was a tad worried that if a snarling demon dripped down out of the black, Obo’s purging flame might singe his cheek.
Mandri paused to take a quick sip of his God’s Eye burgeon, for the God’s Eye sight had faded. Obo had preternatural senses, and he wanted them too, especially now that he’d be taking the lead. When he’d stowed that burgeon away nice and safe inside his robe, he jumped down into that hole and picked up Moto’s torch.
At first there was a single tunnel, and its walls were fixed in brick and reinforced with wooden beams, but these constructions soon gave way to a meandering maze of natural stone which felt as old as the world itself. Mandri led, torch in hand, then Moteah followed, with Moto following close behind. The air was alive with the sounds of footfalls and heavy breathing—some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight, no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons waiting for a chance to strike. After some tracking and backtracking through this maze, Mandri turned a tight corner and came upon a doorless stone arch of ordinary size. This arch’s posts were perfectly plumb and square, and unfamiliar symbols were etched into them.
Mandri hesitated.
“Cold feet?” Moteah asked behind him. 
Mandri’s feet were cold, but that had nothing to do with it. He waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock and asked of anyone, “Can you read this?”
“It’s Schisol’s creed,” Obo said.
Every good Jandri child knows the words to Schisol’s creed. It is a creed which has floated through the Old Jandri world since forever. Solitants address it in mocking tones to rob the words of their power. In Hrkan law, whenever the creed is written in text, each line must be accompanied by a marginal note that explains the utter foolishness of it.

Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth.	(Premise assumes conclusion)
Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right. 	(Ambiguous terms.)
Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.	(Demonstrably wrong.)
Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be together.	(Pseudoprofundity)

That final, ominous line has spurred many a suicide pact, despite demystification. Such events are the work of demons, Solitants say. Demons put it in people’s heads that they’ll be less lonely in Shis if they bring other people down with them. It explains murder-suicides too. It’s all the influence of demons. And here Mandri was, heading down to Shis, being followed.
“We should keep moving,” Moteah said as she nudged Obo’s litter.
Mandri could not take his sight from the threshold. The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of symbols. He dared to reach out and touch them, and he found the grooves to be free of dust. All of it was remarkably clean.
Obo’s reassuring voice popped into his ear. “Whatever’s down here, I’ll handle it.” He then gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder, and confidence returned to Mandri’s legs. He stepped through the gate.
What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone arch made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs, and that was barely enough to allow descent. This path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. As Mandri had only one hand, he gave his torch to Obo to hold. And again his confidence fled—Obo might be able to save him from demons, but he couldn’t chase away a void such as this. 
When he’d shimmied halfway across, he slipped on a loose shard of rock that went tumbling into the void. He was able to regain his balance fairly easily, but he didn’t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the void, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up from below. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him. Neither Moto nor Moteah said anything, and so they journeyed on.
The rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. In places, the walls were so narrow that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways. Obo had to walk, which for him meant swiveling along on his stubs. Next came a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill. He started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself. The torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable—hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows that looked like shallow divots gave way to potholes that twisted his ankle. But the longer it went on the less and less he cared about these scrapes and bruises, because the ways were much more up-and-down than anything in the desert, or even the Goree Pass, and an unremitting burn set into his thighs.
They rested for a while underneath a hang of rock. Moto set up a house of twigs, set them alight, and when these twigs burned to ash they moved on again. They walked for another long while, became sore again, rested again, and at this point no one could agree on whether it was night or day above.
The God’s Eye sight came to Mandri on the third march. First came that familiar flash of white. His vision was flooded with a cosmic swirl of shimmering brightness, and when Mandri shucked his mind free of this blinding vision, he could see everyone’s Sparks stirring in their stomachs. Obo’s gold Spark outshone them all, but bright as he was, bright as they all were, they illuminated nothing. The dark dominion was oppressive, nothing like the Sand above, where even the rocks were coated with fibrous purpose. Down here the rocks were dead, and the only threads of purpose he could see were those which connected their Sparks, as well as those few threads which stretched out of their Sparks and into the tunnel ahead, drawing out the paths which they would walk.
Mandri followed his own thread of purpose and traced its movement with his stomach-dwelling Spark.
It was strange, seeing the future.
Following it was even stranger—did he follow it because he could see it and wanted to know where it went? Or did he follow it because it drew him along like some sort of puppet. The others were puppeted along, no doubt, as they couldn’t see what he saw. They couldn’t see the threads, and so they couldn’t see the choice, much less make one.
Then they came to a fork in the tunnel. All threads of purpose chose to wander right. Moto and Moteah argued about which way to go. Mandri stayed silent. Obo claimed he could hear faint echoes coming from the right, and so they chose to head right.
But Mandri knew that turning right was not a choice. The noise that Obo heard had a cause, and that cause was also caused, and so causes carry on in an infinite regress which could only end in the hand of Solraheen weaving a desired future. Mandri truly believed that this thread he followed was put there by Solraheen, and it was this great faith that compelled him to see it through.
Soon, the way spilled out into a short, brickworked hall, and his shoes slapped onto flat stone tile. This hall then opened up into a cavern whose size was difficult to estimate. It was large enough to hide the echoes of their shuffling feet, so it must have been larger than Shulgi’s throne room. And the entirety of this cavern floor was paved in tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps or so, the floor’s simple square pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. 
This black sun was an unfamiliar design, like a flower with its petals closed and all points pointing inwards. In some sense, it was the opposite of the eightfold Jandri sun. Mandri took it to be a sign of Schisol, and he did not stop to study any of them. He hunched along as if sneaking. He almost laughed at the sight of Moto and Moteah skulking along behind, because if any demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they’d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches.
But there were no demons. In all the blackness around them, there were no demons or demon Sparks. And there weren’t any threads of purpose spelling out their doom. There was only that faint swirl of guiding purpose floating in front of them and disappearing into the dark. 
They walked through this cavern for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern’s end. The purpose ended here—they could go no further. The stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a monstrous stone double-door that would require a team of oxen to open. These doors seemed sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures mostly, snarling demons doing unmentionable things to men and women unfleshed.
Set atop these doors was a stone head, bald like Obo’s, and twice as unnerving because it seemed to be licking its lips at sight of Mandri’s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders. The rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly limbs stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door’s bottom hinges.
Moteah eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn. “What do we do now?”
Mandri was dismayed to see his thread of purpose knot up at the base of the door. “I don’t know,” he said. “I think I just stand here and…”
“Knock?” said Moto.
Mandri reached out to knock, but there wasn’t a clean spot for it. The door’s panel was too full of sculpted, snarling demons. In the end he made no decision, as a thread of purpose alighted out of nothing to guide his knuckles toward the forehead of an anguished man who was being yanked along by hooks set into his skin.
The sound of Mandri’s knock was soft and barely there, two quick raps.
He took a step back, and waited.
He did not wait long, for out of the air around him there arose a voice, a woman’s voice, a voice as old and aggrieved as Elrahet’s.
“Come in,” it said, and it was followed by the sound of stone grinding against stone as these great doors of Shis swiveled in their hinges. They swiveled inward, and the doors’ two halves split to reveal a split of black. Tucked inside this darkness was a golden Spark.
The Spark floated forth and the torchlight revealed its figure—an old woman, tall and graceful, robed in a single black satin sheet that draped down to the floor but did not touch. Mandri recognized her long nose and imperious glare instantly—it was Pel.
It was the demon-witch who’d killed his ox back on his farm in Meskalim. The witch who’d set this all into motion, if causes could begin with her. Foul causes surely did. Not Solraheen’s hand, but Schisol’s.
Moto and Moteah drew their swords.
Pel drew a thin lipped smile.
“Oh, please,” she said to them, “Where are your manners?”
Obo, confident in his litter, said to the siblings, “Put your swords away.”
They both hesitated, but when Moteah sheathed her sword, so did Moto.
“Thank you,” said Pel. “And thank you,” she said as she cast an adoring eye upon Mandri. “You don’t know how long I’ve been trying to end Elrahet, and you managed it perfectly.”
Mandri could not speak. He was entranced by the sight of Pel’s Spark. It was gold, like Elrahet’s, like Obo’s, though it was completely devoid of purpose. Not a single thread in all the world was attached to it.
“Tongue tied?” Pel asked as she glided effortlessly towards him. “Do I frighten you? Speak, Mandrameen. This is your moment.” 
Moto was the one to seize it. “Mazid, Kill her!”
Obo climbed out of his litter and he sat on Mandri’s shoulder like an overgrown cat. He rested his elbow on Mandri’s head and said to Pel, “I’ve heard stories about you.”
“Such irony. A creature spends its short life searching for freedom, and found it by enslaving a Spark.”
“As may be,” said Obo. “But they say that you are my enemy, that you are a great evil, and that I should kill you.”
Pel stood there silently. She was either unwilling or unable to respond. Her face betrayed nothing, set as it was in a stony glare.
Obo said, “Have you nothing to say in your defense?”
Pel curled her lip. “Nothing I say will change what you will do. You will all do what you will.”
“That is a curious turn of phrase,” said Obo. “But, help me understand, was it you who corrupted the old king Greskal and brought forth the Amalgamete?”
“None but the Amalgamete can bring forth the Amalgamete.”
Moto was sweating rain despite the cavern’s chill. He shouted, “Why are you talking to her? Kill her!”
Pel rolled her eyes at the outburst. “Don’t fret, child, I am not the one who condemned you. That was Solraheen, your benevolent, loving, murderous god.”
“She’s Schisol’s shadow—kill her!”
“I am Schisol’s shadow, yes, and proud of it! Know that Solraheen is false and He does not love you. Know that Solraheen never called down that rock of Fabled Black to kill Himself and save the world. Know that this was done by Schisol, know that He sacrificed himself for your sakes, that Solraheen could no longer torture your Sparks.”
“Do you have any proof of your claims?” Obo asked. “Or do witchy women only speak in stories?”
“The proof is the peace that is soon to come. A peace which you will find in the belly of the Amalgamete.”
“I’ve killed your Amalgamete.”
Pel deflected this triumph away with a twitch of her sharp chin. “Another will come. In fact, he stands now on my doorstep.”
Her eyes settled on Mandri and an excited smile played on her lips.
“Mandri?” Obo asked, confused.
“Me?” Mandri echoed.
“You,” Pel said staunchly. “Why else would you be here before me now?”
Mandri’s dignity and vanity welled up his chest, for in no possible world would he assent to eating flesh or looking as foul as that putrid king. He raised his voice and declared, “I’m here because you killed my ox. I’m here because you—”
“Oh, please,” Pel moaned. “Do not bother me with trifles. Know that your grievances are Mandrameen’s, and that Mandrameen is an illusion. Mandrameen was born and he will die, but your real being knows neither beginning nor end. Come with me into Shis, I can show you what I mean. You can bring your friends along.”
It was then that Mandri noticed a new thread of purpose manifesting itself into being. It was drawn from his Spark and it led through Pel’s hip and disappeared behind her, through the doors of Shis.
Mandri took a step back.
“No,” he said firmly. “I’m not going anywhere with you.”
“Why else would you be here?” she asked, and her jagged lips eased into a beatific smile. “Mandrameen, the portrait painter. You’ve painted a thousand faces, but never your own. You may have painted a self-portrait, but know that a true self-portrait is impossible. A mirror hardly helps—you can never capture that look of looking away. And worse, your eyes always see straight into themselves. You are always alert. You are always alive. You are always there. But you have never seen yourself sleeping. You will never see what you look like when you’re dead. Everyone else’s eyes close and will close forever, but you’re own…who’s to say it’s not the world that disappears every time you blink?”
“She’s mad,” Moteah mumbled.
Mandri agreed, but more off-putting than this witch’s rambling was the realization that he hadn’t blinked since the doors of Shis had opened. Maybe it had been longer, maybe not since the God’s Eye burgeon took hold of him. And more than this, Pel had locked her gaze with his, and for a shuttered instant, her true eyes flashed, glowing gold, declaring mystic tidings which Mandri could not comprehend but he could feel—bright, and warm, and thankful.
Then she blinked and her eyes went dark again.
“Do you sleep, Mandrameen? Do you sleep? What happens to Mandrameen when you sleep? Where does he go?”
“I… I’ve never thought about it.”
“Good,” she said. “You’re honest. That’s more than I can say for those who seek an end to their suffering.”
“Kill her already!” Moto pleaded.
Pel seemed pleased to hear Moto’s voice crack.
“Look at this man,” she said as she flicked her beady eyes over the strong-backed Zosan. “See how frightened he is of dying. What does he fear? All he’ll lose are his illusions. Merge his Spark with yours and he shall know peace.”
“Aren’t you forgetting about me?” Obo asked as he readjusted himself atop Mandri’s shoulder. Pel regarded him with an uninterested eye. “You can come along as well.” She then stepped aside to clear a path towards the open doors behind, and she held out an entreating arm towards Mandri. With the back of her hand, she brushed the thread of purpose which led into the void. “Come young Mandrameen. Do not worry about the darkness, your eyes will adjust.”
Mandri stood dumbstruck at the sight of that thread of purpose leading him astray, and he gasped when he realized that he’d taken a step forward.
As quickly as he could manage, he pulled Elrahet’s golden knife from out of his robe, and he slashed that bright white cord in two. The thread of purpose burst into a shimmering mist. Pel hissed and set her furious gaze on Mandri. “Whose purpose do you think you’ve cut?”
Moto and Moteah traded confused looks, unaware of what just happened, and for the first time ever, Obo’s hairless brow scrunched up like paper. “What is she talking about?” he asked.
Pel’s frown curdled into a withering scowl. “I speak of purpose!” she screeched. “Your purpose. Mandrameen’s. Whose purpose have you cut? All the gods are dead, they no longer weave their purpose into our world. All purpose here is yours.” She stared down her long nose at Mandri. “The thread you cut was your own. You put it there, no one else. That frightened you. Why?”
“Because I don’t want to do what you want me to do.”
“Hah! Yes! We speak with Mandrameen! He sees through everyone else’s manipulations except his own. Paints everyone’s picture except his own. Typical. Typical of you all. You slavers of Sparks. You sifters of Selves. Pool your purpose together, and still it will fade.” She turned her scouring stare to the darkness of the cavern, and she threw her voice out into it, saying, “Gentler Sparks….would you grace us with your presence?”
Her request fell into the black, and a moment later the black began stir. Mandri tried to rub the insanity out of his eyes, but yes, the black itself began to stir, and as it weaved and wound like liquid smoke it squelched out growls and shrieks. Bright points of light emerged within it like swallowed stars, and these stars mounded up and grew brighter into full grown Sparks. Then came the pinching laughter of demons—not just two, or three, or twenty demons, for that sky of Sparks was joined by a horde of torch reflecting eyes. Thousands of blinking eyes in a thousand different configurations, all hovering there in the dark—eyes set wide, bovine eyes, mousey eyes, saucer eyes of squid, eightfold sets of spider eyes swaying overhead. 
The first demon to reveal itself was a naked knuckle-walking monkey, vaguely human, with a mouthless face that was scrunched up towards the middle, as if its lips were stuffed up into its nose. Then another set of glowing eyes stepped forth into the light, revealing itself to be a goat headed demon with black Zosan skin and a chiseled physique, and it stood on ungulate legs complete with cloven hooves. This demon was joined by a circle of new grotesqueries, each leaping out, it seemed, from Mandri’s childhood dreams. Every manner of mashed-up anatomy between man, insect, and beast, and this circle of dread surrounded him and his companions, a circle broken only by Pel and the doors of Shis behind her.
“You see,” Pel said, “If you have come to offer yourselves to the slaughter, then I accept.”
Mandri was stuck in shock at the sight of so great an evil—rank upon rank of evil. Enough evil here to bring about the end of days.
“Hold on,” said Obo, unconcerned. “These demons here, they want to kill me?”
“Nothing so crude,” Pel replied. “They simply want to put your Spark back into its rightful place.”
One of the demons nearest Mandri, a tusked woman with the body of a boar snarled and hissed, spraying Mandri’s leg with its stinking spittle.
“She is hungry,” Pel said, amused.
“I’m afraid that this is all unacceptable.”
Obo’s repudiation jolted Pel into amazement. Her thin lips grew tight, her brows jumped, and then she burst into a tremendous fit of laughter, a cackle which was taken up by her demon horde and escalated into a roar.
“Oh, my, my!” she said. “Unacceptable?! My dear creature, we have collected an uncountable number of Sparks throughout the ages. Yours will be no different.”
“Of that uncountable number, how many belonged to Mazid?”
“We have collected the Sparks of gods. I assure you, yours will be no different.”
“Then it seems a peaceable conclusion to our disagreement is not possible.”
“It never was.”
“Very well,” said Obo, and he opened his mouth. His throat ran gold and fire poured out in a beam as bright as the sun, smashing through the air where Pel had been—had been. The old witch expected this turn, and she’d flown away in a blur before Obo’s fire could singe her. Instead, his burst of blazing flame smashed into the doors of Shis.
“Huh,” Obo sputtered. “She’s fast for an old bat.”
Then Pel’s voice screamed out from the void above, “FEAST!”
That word was, as far as witchy pronouncements go, frighteningly unambiguous. It set the sea of demons to chattering—teeth chatter, giggle chatter, yapping-sucking-squealing chatter, and to Mandri’s horror, he saw threads of guiding purpose spool out of these demon’s Sparks and latch onto his own, and onto Obo’s, and onto Moto’s and and Moteah’s. There were so many demons and so many threads that the purpose was thick as a blanket, a circular blanket that split when a black, goat-headed demon took a step forward from the demon’s circle. Next to it was a fish-headed bear giant, and they both loomed large and snarled.
“Relax,” said Obo without a hint of worry, “We can all survive this. If you keep low and—”
The hunting shriek of a demon screeched out as the beast swooped down upon them. This demon was truly frightening—bat-winged and the size of a child, with a child’s flat face and enormous funnel ears that wrapped around its goofy head to frame its pea-sized eyes. It reached down with its feet and splayed its finger-talons wide, and just as it made to shriek again, its whole head was wooshed away by a roaring burst of Mazidfire.
The flame was so hot that it heated the demon’s chest into incandescence. The headless body burst into flames and hurtled overhead like a meteor before crashing into the crowd of demons behind. 
As the first blow struck, all Shis broke loose.
Demons came running, hopping, sliding, striding, galloping towards Mandri and the others. Scales sparkled and muscles bulged, whiskered snouts snapped and fanged maws hissed, pointed beaks screamed for oblivion—but Obo’s golden fire screamed back. He swung his coruscating flame in two great sweeping arcs, and he cut down a circle around Mandri, Moto, and Moteah, obliterating the first rank of evil, cutting the confidence out of that goat-headed demon at the waist. Those that scurried underneath Obo’s sweeping flame—the dog, hog, and lizard demons, the beetle demons—these Obo dispatched with incredible precision and blinding speed as more than twenty beams of fire flared out of his mouth in space of a breath, vaporizing the head of each demented creature on contact. Every smoking corpse burst into flame, leaving a ring of sizzling flesh to serve as stumbling blocks to the rest of the onrushing horde. 
Moto and Moteah gathered close to Mandri, close to Obo, who danced atop Mandri’s shoulder and dealt death to this demon horde. His fire spiraled round and round, and at each turn his flame traveled further out, mowing down larger and larger swathes of evil. In the wake of his golden beam was a smattering of distant explosions as those who fell combusted. 
But the demons were undeterred by the slaughter. On they came. It was not bravery, it was dumb, single-minded evil which drove them to consume all Sparks. And on and on they came. Thousands. Obo blasted birds and bats and all manner of giant insects out of the sky. But more flew and climbed out from unseen holes in the faraway ceiling. Their rippling backs glinted against the flash of Mazidfire, and it seemed the very skin of the cavern rock was writhing, for the swarm of Shis poured forth to protect their nest.
Each of them were tethered by shimmering threads to Mandri’s Spark, yet Obo’s fire spiraled through them all, and one by one these threads burst into mist as their sources were snuffed out. Amongst the roar of fire and agony, Mandri was pricked by the thought that Obo might be a god, a new god for a new age, a god who could conquer malignant purpose. And this little god stood supreme on Mandri’s shoulders, and Mandri could not contain himself as he whooped his excitement. Obo—disgraceful, graceful, pitiful, glorious Obo—was turning away the army of Shis all by himself.
Mandri’s eyes welled up with tears, as being so close to such awesome power was overwhelming. He also cried from the pain as Obo pulled sharply on his hair to keep from falling. But mostly the tears were due to honest awe and fascination. Obo’s pale skin glowed hot as the golden fire poured out of him, and for Mandri, that heat was the sun. He basked in its radiance. He craned his neck to view his savior’s face, and he marveled at the quickness of Obo’s eyes, darting from evil to evil, scouring them with his light.
Then something in Obo’s neck snapped, a muscle or tendon, and Obo’s silver eyes rolled back in their sockets as his flame continued to ruin the dark. His head tilted backwards, undirected, and a worrisome bulge extruded out the side of his white-hot neck until it burst.
Mandri screamed in horror as a gout of golden fire fountained out of that hole in Obo’s throat. Its heat was terrifying, and the force of its surge split the rest of Obo’s neck wide open. Then came a final, sputtering flash of gold, and Obo’s head peeled all the way back onto his shoulders. His fingers lost their grip on Mandri’s hair, and he fell off his perch.
Mandri twisted round and caught the falling Mazid.
“What happened!?” Moteah cried as she scanned the black sky above for some renewed assault which Obo might have missed, but there was only a rain of streaming flames as dead demons fell to the ground.
“Is it dead?” Moto asked as he propped Obo’s head up, hoping the front of Obo’s neck might reattach. But Obo’s eyes did not list from their split-eyed gaze, and his body was fully limp.
Obo had cleared a wide, flaming circle around them, a lake of combusted corpses, but Obo had not killed them all. A thousand threads of murderous purpose stretched through the flames and latched on to Obo’s golden Spark
Mandri wrenched up in rage.
“NO!”
He grabbed hold of his golden knife, and he slashed at those strangling threads as he’d seen Elrahet do. His wild flailing nearly slashed Moto’s hand, but he didn’t care, he slashed out again, and again, and again, and with each slicing stroke, bundles of these puppetry strings fell away, but they grew right back, rejoining themselves to Obo’s Spark.
“They come!” Moteah wailed, and her frightened cry was chased by a bout of cackling laughter as Pel spied their despair from the dark above. She swooped down, and her black robe billowed like smoke. She alighted upon the back of a smoldering toad-man demon whose long tongue rolled out onto the floor. The sight of her beaming smile filled Mandri with rage.
In her hand was her golden blade, and her golden Spark was free from the net of purpose which enmeshed everything else. But Mandri did not need to see a bright white thread to know her purpose, for she licked her long teeth at the sight of Obo’s Spark.
That would not do.
Mandri took his golden knife and sliced open a gash right down Obo’s chest, all the way down to the belly. He reached in and pulled at the ribs, which easily unbuckled from the gleaming white sternum. It opened like the wing of a bird cage, and when Mandri saw his own severed hand laying there in the goop, he almost burst into tears, for that hand was the only part of him that had done anyone any good. There it lay, unused.
“Halt!” Pel shouted. The horde of demons halted by her side. The command was also meant for Mandri, and an anxious quiver split Pel’s lips. “Put down the knife,” she said. “You know not what you do.”
Mandri gripped the knife more tightly. He looked down at Obo’s spherical stomach which listed in the oozing, smoking mess that was Obo’s insides. And there was Obo’s golden Spark. Mandri did not know what to do with it. He only knew that he didn’t want Pel to have it. More than anything he’d ever wanted, he wanted to stop that old witch from swallowing this blessed Spark. 
He reached down with his blade and nicked the stomach’s wet curve. An amber juice spilled out and mixed in with the rest of Obo’s muck.
And the Spark was there, bright as ever. A glorious sliver of its golden light peeped through the hole in the membrane and muscle.
Mandri hesitated.
There was a thread of purpose connecting him to it.
“Yes!” Pell cackled. “Deny my will. Do what you want. Be young Mandrameen and swallow that Spark.”
An anxious moment passed as Mandri wondered what he should do. The many faces of evil surrounded him. Their number was dwarfed by the darkness. Mandri tried to find the thread which marked his future winding through them, but it was all too complex. In the end, it was the sight of Obo’s broken face which made his mind, and at that same instant, Pel let loose a wild scream and took flight. She shot straight for Mandri, and the shock of her gnashing teeth nearly cowed him.
Mandri bent and sipped that liquid Spark into his mouth, then swallowed.
The Spark slimed down his throat.
Pel, flying furious, dodged Moto and Moteah’s swinging swords for their savage arcs were betrayed by arcs of preceding purpose. And just before her gnashing teeth smacked into Mandri’s chest, Obo’s golden Spark merged with Mandri’s own.
At once he was struck by both the witch and an all encompassing bliss. His body crashed to the floor while his mind was lost in senseless joy. Nothing mattered. This wasn’t despair, this was liberation. He was at the bottom of being, and down there was a warmth there that he could dwell. There was a presence there. He was being hugged. Somehow, Obo was with him, as was Elrahet, and that gnawing loneliness which plagued him since he came wailing out of his mother’s womb was gone, gone as if it were never there.
He was brought back to reality by Pel’s haunting laughter.
He lay on the ground, and she was kneeling over him. The brightness of her Spark was dazzling. The brightness of his own Spark glinted in her eyes, but she did not move to feast. And in the depths of Mandri’s bliss, her smile took on new meaning. Instead of delighting in his fear, she seemed satisfied, as if his swallowing of the Spark were a job well done.
“Beautiful,” she muttered as she marveled at Mandri’s joy. And more than admiration, the look in her eyes was one of longing. She locked her gaze with his, and Mandri could feel the emotion pouring out of her as vividly as if she were his mother, a lover, a dearest friend, a most hated enemy. All their history felt tied together, and this was a final parting.
“You see, don’t you, that there is a being greater than yourself.”
She then raised her knife in the air and brought it down upon her own belly. She ripped the gash wide with a pained jerk. Blood poured over her fingers, and with her free hand, she reached in, grabbed her stomach, and pulled it out of her belly.
Her stomach’s mouth had been severed, but the intestines trailed along like a horrible, squelching, worm. She lowered her stomach’s open lip to Mandri’s awestruck mouth.
“Savor the taste,” she wheezed as she tipped her stomach like a wine bag.
Her Spark spilled out and it forced its way into Mandri’s throat. Reality twanged as Schisol’s gift merged with Solraheen’s—twinned divinities combined into one inside his body.
Mandri felt he might explode.
His flesh was not built to house this power.
He coughed.
His stomach spasmed.
Pel’s bony hands fell upon his mouth and forced his jaw shut. With each new breath, her strength dwindled, and as the seed of divinity took root in a stomach fold, she fell back. The smack of her shoulders against the ground forced out an eonic sigh.
With her death, the net of purpose which bound the horde of demons snapped. Their snarling, spitting, chatter went silent, and they all stood as dumb as cattle. Moto and Moteah huddled together against the weight of what they’d witnessed. The demon nearest to them, a bubble-backed ox with a single fang, mooed at them as if in recognition. Then out of that demon’s pink spark came a wiggling thread of purpose. It latched onto the wiggling tail of a sand cat demon with reticulated fur.
The Ox turned its great head towards the cat. Slobber dripped down its jowl. It let loose a bovine bleat, then charged. The cat yowled and reared, and as fast as a thunderclap the whole cavern erupted into chaos—the whole demonic horde fell upon itself. Snake and fowl chased each other. Lizard-man squared off against lizard-woman. Limbs and blood and bodies went flying through the air. Fangs and fingernails ripped at every manner of stomach, and if any demon stopped to eat, its own flesh was torn.
Mandri jumped up with such vigor as he had never felt. He grabbed Pel’s golden knife out of her stomach, and he ran towards the huddled siblings. Their Sparks shone bright. They were almost all he could see. Moteah’s face was a blur. Moto’s voice seemed disembodied.
“We need to get out of here!” Moto screamed as a bat-man demon flew low, chasing a giant fly with the head of a purse-lipped fish.
Mandri handed Pel’s golden knife out to the blur that was Moto.
“Swing it in the air,” he said.
“What?”
Mandri lashed out with his own golden knife and cut a thread of demonic purpose as it wandered towards Moto’s hip.
“Just start swinging and follow me!”
Mandri raced away. The siblings followed, and he charted a certain path through the ravenous, self-defeating horde. He hopped over flailing tail and claw, and he slid under a giant man-stork’s strides. He paused every now then to make sure that insatiable threads which snuck by Moto’s flailing knife were cut away. 
They ran and ran, and all the while, Mandri was losing his sense of bliss. Fear crept in between heavy breaths—not fear of demons, he could avoid them easily. Fear of something else. Something much deeper. Something that he’d swallowed.</Text>
            <Notes>Pell has cut away all her purpose.

—for dying is no great sacrifice, no, Schisol will live, He’ll live for all eternity alone, weeping, just to protect against the chance of His brother rising up and starting it all over again.”

GRAB GOLDEN BLADE

“Because he is gaburshegee. He is infertile ground. He denies everyone else’s plans for his life. No one in the world can tell him what to do. Only, there’s one more person he must reject.”
“You?” Mandri asked.
“Yourself.”

Scintilla of doubt

You deny everyone else’s plans, 

That’s a map of the balkans. It always repays inspection

It was a ___ of bird and beast and fishy-freak feast.


Moto, who’d taken up responsibility for the rear of their little file, mumbled a prayer and kept on marching, and when Mandri lost sight of light of the man’s torch, he dared a whisper to Obo, who still sat in his pack.
“Obo,” he said.
“What?”
“What do you know about Shis?”
“There are too many conflicting stories,” Obo said.</Notes>

Although very good and useful things can be found on the Internet, we know as well that it’s a place where irresponsible anonymity and shameless animosity regrettably compete, embracing perverse calumniation. The One, Holy, Catholic, Apostolic and Palmarian Church, without provoking it, is a victim of these kind of attacks.
The Palmarian Church is fallaciously and cunningly attacked by way of her members and her doctrine. Things are said of her Popes that are painful to repeat, in particular regarding Saint Gregory XVII the Very Great, the first Pope whose See was in El Palmar de Troya. The falseness of those infamous lies can begin to be suspected simply noticing that, with refined cunning, they all make reference to alleged incidents that in themselves are unverifiable. Moreover, Saint Gregory XVII – in the same way as his first predecessor, Saint Peter I the Very Great, who didn’t permit even as Pope that in the Gospel his errors and sins be concealed – never hid his true sins and defects: whoever wishes to know them has only to read his twenty-seventh Pontifical Document or his heavenly vision from 21st of January 2001.

            <Text>A man who expects too much sets out into the Sand alone. Unbeknown to him, a woman who expects too little sets out from the opposite direction. The two travelers happen to cross paths in the shifting middle of the Sand’s Empty Portion. They are hundreds of leagues from any farm or road, hundreds of years from anyone ever setting foot in that spot of the world again. It’s an unlikely convergence in space and time, in the most inhospitable desert, yet the man who expects too much will doubt the significance of this meeting. He actually expects to find a bit of strangeness out in the great sand sea—after all, the desert is large but the world is small and full of chance encounters. 
He looks at the woman who he has stumbled upon and all he can see is the fulfillment of expectation. That is all it is to the man who expects too much. No need to invoke the name of Solraheen.
The other traveler, the woman who expects too little, she is stunned by the significance of the moment. She did not expect to see another person in a place where no one else should be. After all, this part of the Sand is large and full of nothing. For this to happen, for two Sparks to meet in such a wasteland without intending to, well, it could not be a simple coincidence. She and he must have been brought together for some purpose.
Overwhelmed by this glimpse of the divine plan, she turns her eyes to the heavens and invokes the name of Solraheen.
The story ends there. It is nine long lines in the original Old Jandri script, nine lines scratched into an old clay tablet the size of a washing board. Some say the ending is missing, that there is another tablet hidden in a secret vault of some ancient city buried by time, waiting for providence to be revealed. Solitants preach that there must be another tablet, one which proves that the story is about Solraheen Himself. They say Solraheen is the man who expects too little. The woman is his bride. It is the story of their meeting.
But what do they know?
They’re freaks. Maybe that man was just a man and the woman was just a woman and that’s all there is to it. That’s what Seb Ugluu believed. Sometimes he’d dare to venture even further and say that the man and woman never existed at all and that the story is a fable.
He’d tell anyone who’d listen to his liquored up sermons that this story, the raw events, were not important. What was important was the lesson, and there was a lesson in those nine lines, a lesson that’s made easier to see by asking a few simple questions:
 What would have happened if the woman had journeyed into the desert and made it through safely without encountering a soul? 
Absolutely nothing. 
And if nothing had happened, would she have glimpsed the divine plan? 
Absolutely not.
She would have trudged along the ridges of the ergs, her shoulder set against the wind, and she wouldn’t have given a single thought to Solraheen except to pray for her safety.
She never would have been overwhelmed by His mysteries.
She never would have shed a tear at the wonder of chance.
She never would have turned her eyes to the heavens and laced His name with magnificence.
And yet, Solraheen would have been there all the same.
“That’d be the lesson,” Seb would say. Solraheen’s hand is there and it is always there. It is there in the meeting, and it is there in the absence of it. It is there in the pain, and it is there in the pleasure. To be struck dumb by the sight of His plan in one case and not the other is the same as to not see the plan at all. 
The key was to avoid expectations. Expectations turn the vividness of the present moment into an ignorable blur. 
Seb liked to put it a little more bluntly, “Expectations will get ya up the ass.”
He said it, and that’s how it was.
Of course, none of this stopped him from having expectations himself. No one is perfect. Not even Solraheen.
Seb was something of a master of low expectations, because thirty years of living in a desert land that most languages call Emptiness made it easy to keep expectations as low as possible.
Like clouds. Seb did not expect to see clouds. This close to the coast one might have expected to see a bit of moisture pluming the sky but Seb knew better. He knew how the Hias mountains shadowed the Junei hills from rain, how the Istil wind was too weak to carry water up and over those peaks. It was strange because the Hias were hardly mountains at all. The Burgos mountains, those were mountains, fully grown mountains with bald heads and stern granite faces frowning at pilgrims passing by. The Hias were nothing but big mounds of dirt pimpled with boulders. Chins tufted with thornscrub. It seemed like even the weakest watering wind should be able to make it up and over them.
The winds used to be able to do it, in some ancient age. The evidence was there in the foothills. He’d walked the ridges of the Hias and he’d looked east towards the Junei Plain where he could see the lighter orange clay of long-dried washes snaking through the red foothills for as far as there were foothills.
Of course, when he was down in those foothills he never noticed the washes. Down there he’d only see sun baked clay and that clay is so hard that he couldn’t imagine it had ever seen rain. One night, Seb spit on the ground and when he woke, five whole hands later, that glob of spit was still there. The ground was so hard his spit couldn’t seep into it. Some of that might have to do with the fact that Seb’s spit was thick and sticky from all the borcandi spines he chewed, but still, it proved the point. It was like the ground had been dry for so long that it didn’t want to get wet. Like that story of the lonesome spearman who’d been at war for so long that when he returned home to the kindness of his wife he killed her. Just couldn’t deal with a good loving. The Hias hills were like that. A lot of the Sand was like that. Hateful. Nothing lived in it.
Absolutely nothing.
There were lizards, but lizards were everywhere so they didn’t count. Piss on a rock, any rock, and some little lizard will scuttle out from nowhere to sip the urine. 
Birds don’t count either because they’re only passing through. 
Beetles could be found by ripping the waxy bark off bamber trees. Sometimes Seb would have to bore all the way into the tree’s stringy, yellow core to find them. But green crust beetles don’t count as ‘something’. The problem with them is their shells guard a smell that makes the stomach curl, and that smell can’t be boiled or steamed, so they aren’t good eating, and as far as Seb was concerned, if it’s not good eating it might as well not exist. The only things worth paying any mind are things that kill and the things that keep him alive.
Everything else is nothing. 
There’s men out in the Sand, but men are boring. There’s women, but that’s all Seb would say about them—they’re out there. There were other things too, but mostly there was nothing. 
That’s what Seb saw as he stood atop one of the Junei foothills and looked out over the red and empty Junei plain—he saw nothing. Mostly he saw nothing because his eyes weren’t good at seeing way far out. It was mostly a blur. But even if he could see he knew there wouldn’t be a horizon because it’d be lost in the shimmer of a mirage, the kind that looks like water only it's not. A mirage was the perfect metaphor for how Seb viewed the Sand, because it looked like something, but really it was nothing.
Lots and lots of nothing.
“Ey, Seb! There's somethin ‘ere!”
Seb’s ears pricked at the words. The shout had come from a nearby ravine.
Quick and spry as a lizard zipped up on freeweed, Seb scrambled over to the lip of that ravine and peered down into its deep belly. 
One of his fellows was standing there in the middle of it. All the Ayramun were swaddled from head to toe in brown or black wool dusted red by clay, but Seb knew it was Gugi down there because of the way he stood. Only Seb and Gugi stood with that twitchy restlessness that marks out a Jandri man who’s not stopped chewing the spines of borcandi leaves since the day they were weaned off the tit. And Gugi was also a little taller than most. A little lankier. 
Gugi stuck his skinny arm up in the air and waved it towards Seb.
Seb sneered at the eagerness.
“Put your goddamned hand down,” Seb shouted. “I can see ya just fine.”
“Then get your ass down here!” Gugi shouted back.
Seb harrumphed, then started his climb down into the ravine.
As far as ravines go it seemed as full of nothing as any other ravine. It was steeper than most, and it was dry and dusty so Seb struggled to find purchase on the slope. He was forced into a clumsy half-scramble-half-slide to get down the bottom, which was about thirty yards down. Once there he took a moment to shake out the dirt that had fallen into his left boot.
The unexpected thing about this ravine was how even and straight it was, almost like a road. It went straight as an arrow for a full fifty yards before getting lost around a bend. This run was speckled with the dried out husks of karkle bushes. They looked like big black hairballs. Gugi was standing in front of one of them, looking a little spooked.
Seb took his time ambling on over. He fingered a fresh borcandi spine out of his sleeve pocket as he went. He knew there wouldn’t be anything worth noticing because Gugi had a penchant for pointing out any old thing that caught his interest. Maybe there’d be a pricked-up drag-belly hissing inside that bush, but fat little lizards doing four-legged push-ups and flashing their ruddy throats weren’t worth shouting about. 
They weren’t something.
They were to be expected.
Part of the ignorable blur.
Gugi urged him on with an impatient flap of his hand. 
Seb laughed and said, “I ain’t gonna run in this heat.”
Gugi shook his head and mumbled something Seb couldn’t hear. 
“Pipe down, white light, I’m comin’.”
Seb eyed the karkle bush. There was definitely something hidden underneath its twiggy branches. A lumpy shape of something shadowed. A creature of some sort. Big, dark, unmoving, and apparently unconcerned with how Gugi was brushing the karkle’s branches aside to get a better look. 
“What is it?” Seb asked as he crouched next to Gugi.
“See for yourself,” Gugi said as he parted the bush’s brambles.
Seb peered down into the bush’s shadow. His jaw went slack in surprise, and his barely-chewed borcandi spine slipped from his lip.
“Schisol’s shadow,” he muttered. 
There was a skeleton underneath that damned bush.
“Shit.”
“Ain’t it?” Gugi said, eyes open wide in frightened wonder. “Ya know, this is the first bush I looked under.”
“No. The first one?”
“Yep. It’s the first bush I looked under. I was like, this bush is in the perfect position, halfway-up, halfway-down, bet it will be the best spot to—”
“You sayin’ this is the first bush you looked under?”
“Yep.”
Gugi’s eyes weren’t lying. It was the first bush he’d looked under. There were at least forty other bushes in that dusty ravine, and the first one Gugi looks under has got a dead body in it. A quick glance around told Seb it was probably the only one that had a full set of bones in it.
This was really something.
A strange coincidence.
A divine sign.
Seb’s skin prickled.
He picked up his dropped chew and popped it back into his mouth, and resumed his chewing with zeal. It was a little sandy, but Seb wasn’t going to waste a spine. Spines helped him think. They helped him find reasonable conclusions.
This could be a prank.
He eyed Gugi with suspicion.
Gugi was a prankster, had a prankster’s face—thin, a long crooked nose, restless eyes, bad skin, mostly it was in the way he chewed his spines, open-mouthed, provocative, sigh-smiling. It was nasty, the way he chewed, because the man’s teeth were rubbed down to black and yellow nubs. Seb’s teeth were like that too, but he had the good sense to keep his mouth shut. Even when he talked, his lips worked hard to conceal the graveyard in his mouth.
Gugi said, “Ain’t fresh. And it don’t smell.”
“No shit it don’t smell. Thems picked clean.”
Gugi started playing a game of point-and-see, like he was want to do.
“Got an arm,” he said. “Both hands too, but they all scattered. Not a lick of skin.”
Seb squatted down to get away from Gugi’s inane observations. He peered under the low brim of the karkle’s branches.
“Gotta be a man,” he said.
Gugi squatted down next to Seb. “Help me get him out,” he said.
Seb noticed the ground around the bush was stepped on. He set an accusing eye on Seb and asked, “Did you put these bones here?”
“What? No.”
“Gugi. I’m only gonna ask one more time. Did you put these bones here?”
Seb couldn’t read Gugi’s face. The man was so well practiced in deceit. Only sometimes did Gugi’s eyes gave things away, and this wasn’t one of those times.
Gugi said, “You think I’d kidnap some random bit’s bones, haul them all the way out here, then stuff ‘em up under this bush, just to stir you up?”
His eyes weren’t telling. Sometimes, if Seb paused and stared hard at Gugi, the guilt would get to him, and he’d give it up. 
“I didn’t do shit! Damn. I found it here like I said.”
“Then who put it here?” Seb said. “Ain’t nobody jus’ crawl up under a random bush and die.”
“Could be a pilgrim,” Gugi replied. “He’s prolly some pilgrim that was headed for the pass. Crawled up under here to seek shade and forgot to wake up.”
“If that’s what happened, it’s even worse.”
“Why’s that?”
“Because it means a god put him here. Or a demon. It’s providence, one way or the other. Could be curse.”
“It ain’t no curse. It’s jus’ bones.”
“There’s no such thing as ‘jus’ bones’. This goes with what I been sayin’ this whole time—we shouldn’t be settin’ up this damn ambush in these Spark scrubbin’ hills.”
“Seb, if it’s a curse, then let’s move it somewhere else. I aim to use this bush. It’s the perfect spot.”
Seb couldn’t believe his ears. “You gonna hide in this bush?”
“I am,” said Gugi, without a hint of trepidation.
“You gonna hide in the one bush that’s got dead bones in it?”
“There won’t be no bones when we move ‘em. That’s why I need your help. Damn.” 
&quot;You lost your water? This the clearest shout of a cursed bush I ever heard. And more in point of fact, Ayram ought to hear about this. ‘Cause if this is the place where—&quot;
&quot;Don't worry Ayram ‘bout this shit. Jus’ help me move the damn thing.”
“Gugi, how do you not see what’s goin’ on here?”
“Grab his foot.”
“Gugi, listen to me—This is Solraheen tellin’ you that if you hide in this bush, then you gonna die.”
“Grab his foot.”
“No.”
“I grab one, you grab the other.”
Gugi reached down and took a firm grip of the biggest bone in the dead left foot. He pulled it out and tossed it to Seb, 

Gugi said, “You know this body here—this body is the perfect chance for you to get to bother Elrahet.”
“How’s that?”
“You don’t think an old witch don’t want to look over a nice white set of bones? I bet you bring a few bones with you, and now you got something to pester her with instead of your boring old self. Put a skull next to her, and she ain’t gonna be able to shoo you away.”
“Maybe,” Seb said hesitantly.
“Help me carry the bones to Elrahet, and I’ll give you twenty spines.”
The furrow in Seb’s brow softened. “Twenty?”
Gugi nodded. “Twenty.”
Twenty was a lot of spines. A couple weeks worth. There was no telling when they’d be back in the putty hills and he could pick another fill.
“How about it?” Gugi asked.
“Alright.”
Seb bent down to gather up the other foot of the corpse, but Gugi brushed him away, saying, “I’ll make it forty spines if you carry it all yourself.”
“You ain’t got forty spines.”
“I’ll give you twenty spines, and my God’s Eye burgeons.”
“Give me twenty spines, and you tell me where you get your God’s Eye burgeons.”
“No chance. It’s twenty and the burgeons, and you carry this bit all the way to Ayram.”
“I ain’t got a bag.”
“I do.”
Gugi’s pulled the strap of his slump-shouldered bag over his head, and , a bunch of little nothings
“If you don’t think it’s cursed, then what you givin’ up your burgeons’ for? Carry it yourself.”
“I don’t wanna carry it.”
Seb’s brow tightened up again, and he asked, “Why not?”
Gugi smiled. “Because it’s cursed,” he said.
This was why no one liked Gugi—he was never upfront about the way things were. He’d betray anyone he could, if anyone ever thought to trust him. Seb nearly slapped him. “You thought you could get me to take up this cursed body for a measly twenty spines and some God’s Eye burgeons?”
“Am I wrong?”
Gugi’s face twisted into that annoying, presumptuous grin. Seb wanted nothing more than to break some of Ayram’s rules on that grin, but he thought better of it. Best thing to do was to take the grand scheme of things into account.
There were cursed bones under a bush, where no cursed bones should be. 
Maybe he was looking at this all wrong.
Maybe them bones wasn’t cursed.
Solraheen’s hand is there in the pain, and it’s there in the pleasure. A curse could be a blessing, and a blessing could be a curse. There’s no way of knowing which is which until it all plays out. It’s expectations that get in the way of seeing that. If he looked at all this with no expectations, and abstracted out the deadness of the bones from the strangeness of the circumstances, then no doubt he would take Gugi’s deal. God’s Eye burgeons for a little bit of toil? 
The best thing to do was to take the deal.
He said to Gugi, “You ain’t wrong, but dammit, you know I’m gonna kill you someday.” 
“Sure thing, Seb.”
“Before we do anythin’, you’re gonna gimme them burgeons.”
“I’ll give you the spines now, and the burgeons later.”
“Burgeons now, spines later.”
Gugi sighed, then pulled out a leather pouch from his robe and tossed it to Seb. Seb caught it, checked it, pocketed it, and then he crouched down, reached under the karkle’s twigs, and started swiping the bones up into the bag. The bigger bones he had to handle fresh on the skin of his palms, which was disconcerting, but it was over before he knew it. He didn’t stick around for Gugi’s mocking laugh. He took his haul back west, towards the Junei pass, towards the cliff where Ayram and Elrahet were planning out the ambush that would hopefully end all their ambushes for good. He didn’t know why they needed to know about these bones, but he knew they needed to know. They needed to know because he felt like they needed to know.
Even if they didn’t need to know, he was going to do what he wanted to do, and that was how things were.

            <Text>“What did you do that!?” Obo exclaimed. His face was not well suited for anger. W
Mandri replied, “I was trying to earn her trust.”
“You would earn her trust by betraying mine?”
“That’s the idea.”
“You would prove yourself trustworthy by being untrustworthy?”
Mandri set about wrapping the ends of the poultice around his leg. “If we want her to tell us what is going on, then we’ve got to get her to lower her guard, and the best way to do that is to be honest. Honesty is disarming. You should try it sometime.”
“Honesty requires discretion, Mandri, otherwise it causes more problems than it solves.”
“I know what I’m doing.”
“Yet, she left the room.”
“Obo, she left because of you. She hates you. They all hate you. They’re not ever going to talk to you, and because of that, we’ve got to get them to talk to me, and to do that, they have to trust me. If that means they trust you less, so be it. What’s the harm?”
Obo’s mood softened a little. “I don’t blame you for not knowing this—it’s my fault for not telling you—but this girl reacts extremely negatively to anything that doesn’t reek of kindness.”
“What makes you say that?”
“Anything that’s harsh, or argumentative, or loud, puts her off. She removes herself from any perceived hostility.”

Mandri drew a side-long smirk towards Obo and said, “We’ve been scheming an escape. That’s why he wants to introduce himself.”
“What?”
“He wants to get to know you to better understand how he can use you. Manipulate you. That’s what he’s been doing with me. He’s a schemer. Look at him.”

“No more talking with the Mazid,” she said. 
“Why not?”
“Because I said so.”
Her eyes flicked to the end of the unwrapped poultice. “And you can tie that up yourself.” She took down her basket from behind and quickly gathered up her ministrations.
“Moto’s your brother, right?”
She nodded.
“You know, he’s the one who did this to me.”
“He bit you?”
“No, he— ”
“I don’t care.”
“But—”
“Am I Moto? No? Then shut up about it.”


Both he and Moteah looked at Obo.
“That is not true,” Obo insisted. Mandri marveled at how hard it was to read his face. He played at indignation, but it wasn’t quite that, not really. Hard to read a face without features—hairless brows, lashless eyes, and colorless skin—Obo looked more like an under-painting than a fully realized person.
“Obo also told me he never lies, so you know that means he lies all the time.”
“That is not true either.”
“Obo, you’re not fooling anyone.”

            <Title>Solgi Erg</Title>
            <Text>The evening sun brought them out of the storm’s deep-sand wake and onto solid clay. This was still officially part of the Sand’s Pitted Portion, though there were no pits. There were scraggly bushes and a few stunted trees with wavy trunks. Ayram propped his great pack up against one of these miniature, leaf-bare trees, and then he lay up underneath it to squeeze in a short rest. He permitted Seb to build a smokeless fire. Mandri felt smart in reminding everyone that a Mazidariga didn’t need smoke to find them, and he was told that the Hrks were not the only people from which they needed to hide.
They sat around the fire, watching the sun set. They munched on hardtack, and Mandri was allowed a swig of wine that tasted like sour beer. They conversed about the terrain ahead and the difficulties they might face. Conversation turned to the Great Solgi Erg. The Great Erg was not in their way, but any fireside chat about the Sand’s features cannot end without mentioning it at least once. 
 Mandri made the mistake of calling it the Solgi Erg. 
“The Great Solgi Erg,” Moteah corrected.
“My apologies.”
“Plenty of ergs in the sand, only one of them is Great. Elrahet knows the story of the Erg’s creation.” She said this with some enthusiasm, as if yearning to hear it again.
Elrahet simply sneered and said, “No man or woman knows the story.”
“But you said—”
“There were old memories, memories said to have come straight from the mouth of Solraheen—those memories are lies. No truth survives unscathed from the age when Solraheen shaped His voice into word, for that age was long before the corruption of signs and symbols. The story I know is one shaped by memory, and memory is one big belly-aching lie.”
“But what about—”
“Solraheen made those mountains of sand a long time ago,” Elrahet said, completely ignoring Moteah’s stammering. “That is all that can be said for the truth of the Great Erg. Everything else is in doubt. The very name is in doubt. You know that line of sand as the Great Solgi Erg for you were brought up in this Solitant infested world, but that sand has other names. Older names. Which is the true name? Who can say?”
Mandri admired the old woman’s stamina. She’d been walking all day, and here she was, charging through the telling of a story.
She said, “The Solitants claim that Solraheen planted a stick in the ground to mark one of His garden’s eight corners. Then He left. He left that stick in the ground. Where did He go? Only Sol-knows-where. They say He left to pace out the rest of His garden. They say His passing along the surface of the world kicked up the first wind, the Shulsai, and this wind circled the earth and came back around to puff upon that planted stick. 
“The Shulsai blew sand against the stick, and soon an egg of a sand dune built up in the stick’s lee. Nine moons later, and that fledgling dune had grown up to swallow the stick whole. All it took was that one stick, and it birthed the first dune, and this dune grew, and grew, and grew until it was named the Primal Erg, and it was belly-full, rolling across the world, leaving littler ergs in its wake. It rolled all the way to the edge of land, and there it stopped. It has been bleeding into the sea ever since, half the size of what it once was. Now we call it the Great Solgi Erg.”
“Now Mandri,” Moteah said when Elrahet began to nibble at the edge of a wafer of hardtack. “Do you think Solraheen meant to do it? Do you think He knew that after planting that stick in the ground, that a whole sand sea would swell up around it? Did He make the erg on purpose?”
“I don’t think Solraheen makes mistakes,” said Mandri.
“Yessss,” said Elrahet, hissing like a snake. “Yes, that’s what the Solitants say. They call it the Solgi Erg, because Solgi means, ‘Sol’s gift’. Yet I heard it called the Great Solzima Erg, and zima means—do you know what it means?”
“No.”
“It means shame. It is named ‘Sol’s shame’, because it is a mistake. If Solraheen had intended for the erg to form, He would have built it up with his own two hands as He did with everything else in His garden. And why should He want to turn fertile black earth into a mountain of useless sand? These Old Believers could not believe that Solraheen would wander off into the middle of the world and shape lakes that reflect the light of the divine, fill them with creatures of unfathomable grace and beauty, and yet, at the same time, He would leave the Erg to struggle up on its own, a basic sameness of stuff with no redeeming qualities. All the erg did was procreate and ripple the wind. Hah! Same could be said for Hrks!”
Her excited, toothless smile settled into a deep and easy sneer. “Old Believers claim that when Solraheen returned to the stick that He’d stuck in Jandri’s eastern rib, and when He saw the Erg standing there, He fell into a deep despair. It would take eons to clean up those dunes, even for Him. So He created the Buggal wind to blow it away, and then He left.”
“Well, that’s not the story that I’ve been told,” said Mandri.
“Oh? Enlighten me, young Lord.”
“I couldn’t do the story justice.”
“Have you ever seen the Erg for yourself?” 
“I have seen it. From the water.”
Elrahet chuckled. “From the water, he says! You’ve been bit by Solitants, boy. Yes, I know their story. See how Solraheen’s golden light shimmers across Sand, they say. And think of the variety! Tidal dunes in the lee of hills, echoing dunes on the windward side. Crescent dunes, snake dunes, crater dunes rimmed with grass. Go to the Empty Portion and marvel at the rows of arcing dunes marching towards the horizon, or lose your mind at the sight of the perfectly flat and straight ridges line the Seedra. Stripes, domes, lizardfeet, hairpins, scallops, stars, all mounds of sand that vary in size in temperament. It rivals any family of flowers. 
“They say that these dunes are pigment, that the wind is the brush, and that Solraheen’s hand is the hand which sets all things in motion. The Sand is alive, it moves and creates itself—they’re especially fond of saying that. They see the Sand as a Sparked being, alive as much as you and I. The Ergs drift across the desert, eat the rocks, and shit them out behind, the parts they can’t digest. You can hear the dunes howl if you stoop and listen. And the Solitants say all this to sell a lie, they say all you need to do to change the world is to plant a leg in the sand, as Solraheen planted His stick, and the wave you create can become a mountain. It’s a hopeful message. I hope you don’t believe it.”</Text>

            <Text>A man who expects too much sets out into the Sand alone. Unbeknown to him, a woman who expects too little sets out from the opposite direction. The two travelers happen to cross paths in the shifting middle of the Sand’s Empty Portion. They are hundreds of leagues from any farm or road, hundreds of years from anyone ever setting foot in that spot of the world again. It’s an unlikely convergence in space and time, in the most inhospitable desert, yet the man who expects too much will doubt the significance of this meeting. He actually expects to find a bit of strangeness out in the great sand sea—after all, the desert is large but the world is small and full of chance encounters. 
He looks at the woman who he has stumbled upon and all he can see is the fulfillment of expectation. That is all it is to the man who expects too much. No need to invoke the name of Solraheen.
The other traveler, the woman who expects too little, she is stunned by the significance of the moment. She did not expect to see another person in a place where no one else should be. After all, this part of the Sand is large and full of nothing. For this to happen, for two Sparks to meet in such a wasteland without intending to, well, it could not be a simple coincidence. She and he must have been brought together for some purpose.
Overwhelmed by this glimpse of the divine plan, she turns her eyes to the heavens and invokes the name of Solraheen.
The story ends there. It is nine long lines in the original Old Jandri script, nine lines scratched into an old clay tablet the size of a washing board. Some say the ending is missing, that there is another tablet hidden in a secret vault of some ancient city buried by time, waiting for providence to be revealed. Solitants preach that there must be another tablet, one which proves that the story is about Solraheen Himself. They say Solraheen is the man who expects too little. The woman is his bride. It is the story of their meeting.
But what do they know?
They’re freaks. Maybe that man was just a man and the woman was just a woman and that’s all there is to it. That’s what Seb Ugluu believed. Sometimes he’d dare to venture even further and say that the man and woman never existed at all and that the story is a fable.
He’d tell anyone who’d listen to his liquored up sermons that this story, the raw events, were not important. What was important was the lesson, and there was a lesson in those nine lines, a lesson that’s made easier to see by asking a few simple questions:
 What would have happened if the woman had journeyed into the desert and made it through safely without encountering a soul? 
Absolutely nothing. 
And if nothing had happened, would she have glimpsed the divine plan? 
Absolutely not.
She would have trudged along the ridges of the ergs, her shoulder set against the wind, and she wouldn’t have given a single thought to Solraheen except to pray for her safety.
She never would have been overwhelmed by His mysteries.
She never would have shed a tear at the wonder of chance.
She never would have turned her eyes to the heavens and laced His name with magnificence.
And yet, Solraheen would have been there all the same.
“That’d be the lesson,” Seb would say. Solraheen’s hand is there and it is always there. It is there in the meeting, and it is there in the absence of it. It is there in the pain, and it is there in the pleasure. To be struck dumb by the sight of His plan in one case and not the other is the same as to not see the plan at all. 
The key was to avoid expectations. Expectations turn the vividness of the present moment into an ignorable blur. 
Seb liked to put it a little more bluntly, “Expectations will get ya up the ass.”
He said it, and that’s how it was.
Of course, none of this stopped him from having expectations himself. No one is perfect. Not even Solraheen.
Seb was something of a master of low expectations, because thirty years of living in a desert land that most languages call Emptiness made it easy to keep expectations as low as possible.
Like clouds. Seb did not expect to see clouds. This close to the coast one might have expected to see a bit of moisture pluming the sky but Seb knew better. He knew how the Hias mountains shadowed the Junei hills from rain, how the Istil wind was too weak to carry water up and over those peaks. It was strange because the Hias were hardly mountains at all. The Burgos mountains, those were mountains, fully grown mountains with bald heads and stern granite faces frowning at pilgrims passing by. The Hias were nothing but big mounds of dirt pimpled with boulders. Chins tufted with thornscrub. It seemed like even the weakest watering wind should be able to make it up and over them.
The winds used to be able to do it, in some ancient age. The evidence was there in the foothills. He’d walked the ridges of the Hias and he’d looked east towards the Junei Plain where he could see the lighter orange clay of long-dried washes snaking through the red foothills for as far as there were foothills.
Of course, when he was down in those foothills he never noticed the washes. Down there he’d only see sun baked clay and that clay is so hard that he couldn’t imagine it had ever seen rain. One night, Seb spit on the ground and when he woke, five whole hands later, that glob of spit was still there. The ground was so hard his spit couldn’t seep into it. Some of that might have to do with the fact that Seb’s spit was thick and sticky from all the borcandi spines he chewed, but still, it proved the point. It was like the ground had been dry for so long that it didn’t want to get wet. Like that story of the lonesome spearman who’d been at war for so long that when he returned home to the kindness of his wife he killed her. Just couldn’t deal with a good loving. The Hias hills were like that. A lot of the Sand was like that. Hateful. Nothing lived in it.
Absolutely nothing.
There were lizards, but lizards were everywhere so they didn’t count. Piss on a rock, any rock, and some little lizard will scuttle out from nowhere to sip the urine. 
Birds don’t count either because they’re only passing through. 
Beetles could be found by ripping the waxy bark off bamber trees. Sometimes Seb would have to bore all the way into the tree’s stringy, yellow core to find them. But green crust beetles don’t count as ‘something’. The problem with them is their shells guard a smell that makes the stomach curl, and that smell can’t be boiled or steamed, so they aren’t good eating, and as far as Seb was concerned, if it’s not good eating it might as well not exist. The only things worth paying any mind are things that kill and the things that keep him alive.
Everything else is nothing. 
There’s men out in the Sand, but men are boring. There’s women, but that’s all Seb would say about them—they’re out there. There were other things too, but mostly there was nothing. 
That’s what Seb saw as he stood atop one of the Junei foothills and looked out over the red and empty Junei plain—he saw nothing. Mostly he saw nothing because his eyes weren’t good at seeing way far out. It was mostly a blur. But even if he could see he knew there wouldn’t be a horizon because it’d be lost in the shimmer of a mirage, the kind that looks like water only it's not. A mirage was the perfect metaphor for how Seb viewed the Sand, because it looked like something, but really it was nothing.
Lots and lots of nothing.

“When philosophy study meta-philosophy, they can’t do philosophy anymore. I’ll stand behind Russell and Moore and the other early analytic philosophers.. The aim of philosophy is to give a picture of the whole of reality, the fundamental things in it, and the most important ways in which those things are related to one another.
- my conception is still philosophy as such; philosophy as model optimization and transversal of the possibility space.
Of course this is a blank cheque, because you want to know what ‘generality’ means, or what it means to be ‘fundamental’, what are important was of being related, what does it mean to be related. This is a rough shape for what things should turn out to be, and it distinguishes philosophy from science in the following fashion - in contrast with science, philosophy concerns itself with the fact that such and such are the *only* kinds of things there are. Because of its general character, philosophy also enters into question of exclusion, about what there isn’t in reality.

Philosophy is further removed from the tribunal of experience than any other discipline. The underdetermination fo theory by data is far greater there than elsewhere -Quine
As such philosophy is far less certain than any other discipline.

How order arises in the world and how thought directs itself upon these things.

The question of realtions is one of the most important issues in philosophy, as most other things turn on it. Order is one of the most fundamental things about the world, events are arranged in space and time, events have causes, configured upon the laws of nature, can be measured. How is any of this possible? If order
isn't possible then we will have to condemn what science and common sense say about the world to the bin of appearances and self-contradictions. If there is no order then the true reality which cannot be ordered will be confined to inscrutable something concealed behind the phantasmagoria of number, space, time, and matter.

and indeed that was exactly the conception that bradley proposed in 1893 in his appearance in reality
the world we encounter because it fundamentally consists in things related to one another in these ordered ways

and cannot ultimately be intelligible must be mere appearance because order is unintelligible so reality must be something

fundamentally unordered but which since we don't encounter it remains ultimately inscrutable to us

 so far as moore and russell's were concerned nothing said by a philosopher
could possibly justify drawing the conclusion that there was no order in the world

we are far more certain of the findings of science and common sense than of the validity and soundness of
8:24
any philosophical argument deployed against them the reasoning here was later developed by
8:29
moore um in his defense of common sense realism about the external world he famously
8:34
offered to refute the skeptic by holding up his hands and saying here are hands and he thought that
8:40
namely here or two external external world items and he thought there was no philosophical argument you
8:46
could raise against the validity and soundness of that argument who whose character was more certain than the
8:53
argument that i just gave 

so it's because we have we are certain or relatively certain of what science and common sense tell us the philosophy has to
9:53
ultimately to be constrained to make sense of what science and common sense say to understand how ultimately the things
9:59
said by science and common sense can hang together in a unified synoptic world vision

ffirming that relations are necessary to our world view doesn't tell us what relations are and
10:18
what i'd like us to talk about a little bit today is some of the specific accounts that russell provided
10:24
microexplanations if you will of how relations actually actually succeed in fulfilling the metaphysical responsibility fall into
10:30
them of explaining how order arises i said earlier that um so i'm skeptical
10:36
of there being any uh fulfilling or deeply enlightening meta philosophy


the first which arose in around 1903
11:40
is the view that relations are essentially endowed with what frege called sense or sometimes direction not to be as
11:45
confused with  frege’s notion of sense for those who are interested in frege. this view was destined to become the mainstream view amongst philosophers indeed i think it still is the mainstream view amongst philosophers
11:58
um let me point you to what he says here. A relational proposition may be symbolized by A or B where R is the relation and A and B are the terms. okay now we get the idea of direction that is to say it's a characteristic of a relation of two terms that proceeds so to speak from one end A to the other B and this is what we call the sense of the relation and as is we shall find the source of order and series in the world. Things can come from first, second, and third, is that there’s a direction involved, applying first to A, and then to B. From this we get the converse relation, which is the ralation that holds between B and A whenever R holds between A and B. The difference between an asymmetrical sign and its converse. E.g. John is taller than eve, eve is shorter than adam.

Russel’s synonomy arguemnt
Before and after only differ linguistically, there is not a different reality corresponding to them.  - Neutral theory of relations. Relations dont have a direction they dont travel in one way rather than another. This view was dropped, and russle returned to his early view that relations are inherently directional.

Two theories of relations, two theories of judgement. 1.) propositions were essentially external items

Avoid the fate of idealist philosophers, to maximise our exposure of the human mind to what there is in reality, not hide behind the veil of apperances. So they made the contents of our minds the propositions not internal arrangements of ideas but actually identified the propositions with combat with complex unities composed of the very entities they were thinking about

When russell declared to russell in 1901, that when you think about Mont Blanc, Mont Blanc and all its snow fields is literallly a constituent of your thought, theres no intermediary that you’re aquainted with which gives you access to that proposition rather your thought which is directly out and encapsulates mont blanc with all the snow feilds thats what we’re all doing right now.

Judgement is then conceived as a binary relation between a subject and a proposition conceived of.

S judges that P - gives the logic form of judgement. A subject to a proposition is a unified complex entity.

Russell and moore started to worry about what is this complex entity. 

First theory said that judgement was a binary rleation between subject and proposition - true and false.

His second theory was that judgement is a multiple relation. It’s a relation which doesn’t take you between a subject and a single proposition, but takes you between the subject and all the things that intuitively speaking that proposition is about.

1910 paper - nature of truth and falsehood.
A loves B. This consists of a relation of the person judging to a and love and b. i.e. to the terms A and B and the relation ‘loves’, but the judgment is not the same as the judgement b loves a, thus the relation must not be abstractly before the mind but must be before it as proceeding from A to B rather than from B to A.
The corresponding complex which is to make our judgements true consists of a related b by the relation which was before us in our judgmenet. The idea is, instead of hte mind simply embracing a proposition you’re to imagine the cognitive tentacles reaching out from your mind and then touching on the individual elements of a proposition rather as you might touch on the notes of a keyboard to play a melody. It’s the critical order in which the mind reaches out and touches upon the things it’s thinking about that constitutes as being a proposition. And what you think is true when the way in which the judgment relation touches upon the elements that you’re thinking about corresponds to the way in which those things are actually arranged in the world. So the idea is that the fact that Subject judges in this way has enough unity to render a truth valuable, but not so much as to make a mystery of the difference between true and false propositions.

So by thinking about truth as an extrinsic property of our judgement rather than intrinsic feature we can see how we can judge false propositions well in order to get the theory precise. What you have to do is explain what it means for the cognitive tentacles to touch upon the elements of a proposition in the right order in the right way and to conceive of the relation proceeding from a to b. What does it mean to hold a relation before the mind is proceeding from a and b, well that was where russell devoted his attention. Then Wittgenstein arrived on the scene. So here’s the anti-hero of our story. Russell was writing about these views in his theory of knowledge manuscript which he abanded as a result of criticism’s in 1913. 
“I showed wittgenstein a crucial part of what I’ve been writing and he said it was all wrong, not realiesing the difficulties that he had tried, my view and knew it wouldn’t work, I couldn’t udnerstand his objection, in fact he was very inarticulate but I felt in my bones that he had seen something that I had missed.

Witt- I believe it’s obvious that from the proposition A judges, say that A is in relation R to B, that, correctly analyzed, the proposition A or B or Not A or B must follow directly without the use of any other premise.
every right theory of judgment must make it impossible for me to judge that this table pen holders the book russell's theory does not satisfy this requirement proper theory of judgment must make it impossible to judge nonsense.

The problem of false propositions.



The American philosopher Norman Malcolm credits Piero Sraffa with breaking Wittgenstein's hold of the notion that a proposition must literally be a picture of reality by means of a rude gesture from Sraffa, followed by Sraffa asking, &quot;What is the logical form of that?&quot;[3] In the Introduction to the book written in 1945 Wittgenstein said Sraffa &quot;for many years unceasingly practiced on my thoughts. I am indebted to this stimulus for the most consequential ideas in this book&quot;. 

Wittgenstein develops this discussion of games into the key notion of a language-game. For Wittgenstein, his use of the term language-game &quot;is meant to bring into prominence the fact that the speaking of language is part of an activity, or of a life-form.&quot;[5] A central feature of language-games is that language is used in context and cannot be understood outside of that context. Wittgenstein lists the following as examples of language-games: “Giving orders, and obeying them”; “describing the appearance of an object, or giving its measurements”; “constructing an object from a description (a drawing)”; “reporting an event”; “speculating about an event.&quot;[5] The famous example is the meaning of the word &quot;game&quot;. We speak of various kinds of games: board games, betting games, sports, and &quot;war games&quot;. These are all different uses of the word &quot;games&quot;. Wittgenstein also gives the example of &quot;Water!&quot;, which can be used as an exclamation, an order, a request, or an answer to a question. The meaning of the word depends on the language-game in which it is used. Another way Wittgenstein makes the point is that the word &quot;water&quot; has no meaning apart from its use within a language-game. One might use the word as an order to have someone else bring you a glass of water. But it can also be used to warn someone that the water has been poisoned. One might even use the word as a code by members of a secret society. 

The Investigations deal largely with the difficulties of language and meaning. Wittgenstein viewed the tools of language as being fundamentally simple [a][non-primary source needed], and he believed that philosophers had obscured this simplicity by misusing language and by asking meaningless questions. He attempted in the Investigations to make things clear: &quot;Der Fliege den Ausweg aus dem Fliegenglas zeigen&quot;—to show the fly the way out of the fly bottle.[6] 


The individual words in a language name objects—sentences are combinations of such names. In this picture of language, we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands. 

The essential point of this exercise is often missed. Wittgenstein's point is not that it is impossible to define &quot;game&quot;, but that even if we don't have a definition, we can still use the word successfully 

Ernest Gellner wrote the book Words and Things, in which he was fiercely critical of the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, J. L. Austin, Gilbert Ryle, Antony Flew, P. F. Strawson and many others. Ryle refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal Mind (which he edited), and Bertrand Russell (who had written an approving foreword) protested in a letter to The Times. A response from Ryle and a lengthy correspondence ensued.[35]
Besides stressing the differences between the Investigations' and the Tractatus, there are critical approaches which have argued that there is much more continuity and similarity between the two works than supposed. One of these is the New Wittgenstein approach.

Hacker argues that these are indeed problems, only not empirical ones. They are conceptual problems and puzzlements that are to be dissolved or resolved by logico-linguistic analysis. It follows that scientific inquiry (learning more facts about humans or the world) does not help to resolve them anymore than discoveries in physics can help to prove a mathematical theorem. His 2003 book &quot;Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience&quot;, co-authored with neuroscientist Max Bennett, contains an exposition of these views, and critiques of the ideas of many contemporary neuroscientists and philosophers, including Francis Crick, Antonio Damasio, Daniel Dennett, John Searle, and others. 


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hacker

Hacker in general finds many received components of current philosophy of mind to be incoherent. He rejects mind-brain identity theories, as well as functionalism, eliminativism and other forms of reductionism. He advocates methodological pluralism, denying that standard explanations of human conduct are causal, and insisting on the irreducibility of explanation in terms of reasons and goals. He denies that psychological attributes can be intelligibly ascribed to the brain, insisting that they are ascribable only to the human being as a whole. He has endeavoured to show that the puzzles and 'mysteries' of consciousness dissolve under careful analysis of the various forms of intransitive and transitive consciousness, and that so-called qualia are no more than a philosopher's fiction. 

Russell despised psychologism; he wanted a strict and clear relationship between analytical language (in logic and mathematics) and the physical world. Even as early as the Tractatus, Wittgenstein was focused on trying to deal with the paradoxes and outright holes in Russell’s kind of analytical philosophy, though in the Tractatus he was merely looking for a means to limit philosophical language to what actually could be rigorously representative. By the time Wittgenstein got to the Investigations, he was fully committed to the idea that language was social and conventional, not objective and analytical, and while there was no way that Russell could refute that, there’s also no way that Russell could accept it without abandoning his own life-project.

&quot;When they (my elders) named some object, and accordingly moved towards something, I saw this and I grasped that the thing was called by the sound they uttered when they meant to point it out. Their intention was shewn by their bodily movements, as it were the natural language of all peoples: the expression of the face, the play of the eyes, the movement of other parts of the body, and the tone of voice which expresses our state of mind in seeking, having, rejecting, or avoiding something. Thus, as I heard words repeatedly used in their proper places in various sentences, I gradually learnt to understand what objects they signified; and after I had trained my mouth to form these signs, I used them to express my own desires.&quot;  - Augustine

These words, it seems to me, give us a particular picture of the essence of human language. It is this: the individual words in language name objects—sentences are combinations of such names.——In this picture of language we find the roots of the following idea: Every word has a meaning. This meaning is correlated with the word. It is the object for which the word stands. Augustine does not speak of there being any difference between kinds of word. If you describe the learning of language in this way you are, I believe, thinking primarily of nouns like &quot;table&quot;, &quot;chair&quot;, &quot;bread&quot;, and of people's names, and only secondarily of the names of certain actions and properties; and of the remaining kinds of word as something that will take care of itself. Now think of the following use of lang 


That philosophical concept of meaning has its place in a primitive idea of the way language functions. But one can also say that it is the idea of a language more primitive than ours. Let us imagine a language for which the description given by Augustine is right. The language is meant to serve for communication between a builder A and an assistant B. A is building with buildingstones: there are blocks, pillars, slabs and beams. B has to pass the stones, and that in the order in which A needs them. For this purpose they use a language consisting of the words &quot;block&quot;, &quot;pillar&quot;, &quot;slab&quot;, &quot;beam&quot;. A calls them out;—B brings the stone which he has learnt to bring at such-and-such a call.——Conceive this as a complete primitive language. 3. Augustine, we might say, does describe a system of communication; only not everything that we call language is this system. And one has to say this in many cases where the question arises &quot;Is this an appropriate description or not?&quot; The answer is: &quot;Yes, it is appropriate, but only for this narrowly circumscribed region, not for the whole of what you were claiming to describe.&quot; It is as if someone were to say: &quot;A game consists in moving objects about on a surface according to certain rules . . .&quot;—and we replied: You seem to be thinking of board games, but there are others. You can make your definition correct by expressly restricting it to those games. 


A child uses such primitive forms of language when it learns to talk. Here the teaching of language is not explanation, but training. 

An important part of the training will consist in the teacher's pointing to the objects, directing the child's attention to them, and at the same time uttering a word; for instance, the word &quot;slab&quot; as he points to that shape. 
This ostensive teaching of words can be said to establish an association between the word and the thing. But what does this mean? Well, it may mean various things; but one very likely thinks first of all that a picture of the object comes before the child's mind when it hears the word. But now, if this does happen—is it the purpose of the word?—Yes, it may be the purpose.—I can imagine such a use of words 
But if the ostensive teaching has this effect,—am I to say that it effects an understanding of the word? Don't you understand the call &quot;Slab!&quot; if you act upon it in such-and-such a way?—Doubtless the ostensive teaching helped to bring this about; but only together with a particular training. With different training the same ostensive teaching of these words would have effected a quite different understanding. &quot;I set the brake up by connecting up rod and lever.&quot;—Yes, given the whole of the rest of the mechanism. Only in conjunction with that is it a brake-lever, and separated from its support it is not even a lever; it may be anything, or nothing 

We can also think of the whole process of using words in (2) as one of those games by means of which children learn their native language. I will call these games &quot;language-games&quot; and will sometimes speak of a primitive language as a language-game. And the processes of naming the stones and of repeating words after someone might also be called language-games. Think of much of the use of words in games like ring-a-ring-a-roses. I shall also call the whole, consisting of language and the actions into which it is woven, the &quot;language-game&quot;.

            <Text>What felt like a full day passed before the dull howl of the storm outside subsided. When it was gone, Mandri was forced out of the ladder room so that Ayram could punch his way through the glutted hole in the ceiling. The first stab of Ayram’s spear saw a tumble of bricks fall down to the ground, and the second sent a stream of sand pouring into the room. It poured for a worrying while, filling up the room to as high as Ayram’s waist, and Mandri’s eyes. Eventually, it trickled to a stop. A few more stabs of Ayram’s spear encouraged a further collapse of stone and the glorious golden light of day shone through. Ayram climbed out, then called for his people to join him.
Mandri emerged into the fresh desert air and was surprised to find himself at the bottom of a conical pit of sand. Ayram was standing up on the rim of this crater, reckoning the storm’s track. He said the beast was headed north-to-northeast. The Hrks would be blocked from that direction, and that meant the best path forward was towards the Goree Pass. 
For his plans to succeed, they would have to move fast. They would be traveling during daylight hours.
They departed in much the same fashion as they had arrived, with Seb’s steady pace carrying him a long way out in front, followed by Ayram and Moto, followed by Mandri hauling Obo and  his ridiculous sword and two sacks of charmed rocks. The women remained in the rear.
The energy of the passing storm still hadn’t left Mandri. That sandstorm, now darkening the northern wastes, was the most incredible thing he’d ever experienced while sober. It had him humming old pilgrims tunes about the desert’s beauty. But this sentiment did not last long, for the sun was up, the heat was rising, and the wind was blowing. As it is in the world of the Sand, when the wind blows, the sand accumulates. Sand attracts sand attracts sand. It sneaks into the shoes, shimmies under the nails, it chokes, and stifles, and narrows the world. And that’s how it was for the vast majority of the journey towards the Goree pass, so Mandri kept his head down and plodded through it. But it was a long journey, and as the Sand knew Mandri was a stranger, it was intent on providing a bit of show-and-tell.</Text>

            <Text>Humans are redoubtable creatures when gold is at hand. There isn’t much a man or woman wouldn’t do for gold, for gold is as bright and as immutable as the divine. Leave it in the dirt for a million years and it will stay as brilliant as the day it was interred. Roll it around in the hands and it provokes a yearning akin to spiritual rapture—a yearning for more, for as much as one can get.
//
The folk of Meskalim devoted their lives to gold, even though they had practically none. There used to be a well-stocked gold mine running under the city, but it had long run dry. Meskalim’s temple was poor and its people poorer. Its streets weren’t laid out with any sense, much less paved, and these mucky avenues didn’t adhere to the natural contours of the land because when someone wanted to build a house they simply plopped it down wherever inspiration struck. And these houses were ugly things, shouldn’t be called houses—they were dwellings, crumpled slugs of mud, lumber, and straw with windowless walls all askew. There wasn’t a true roof beam in all the lower city. A horde of these things were smashed up against each other like one big deposit of mud that the Istil wind had just happened to blow together.
Mandri couldn’t stand the sight of it unless he was deep in a burgeon binge.
Unfortunately, he had to pace his beer because he couldn’t afford to be so run through that he couldn’t walk. He had to feather the beer’s effect, take sips from his beer-skin every hundred staggered steps or so to keep himself bouncing off that point of no return. It was a dangerous game, taking off the edge in chunks, but it was one he was determined to play to avoid thinking about, well, thinking about most things. Primarily he was fleeing from the memory of that old witchy bitch’s bloody haunting face. If he didn’t keep moving, she might pop out of the clouds and smash right through his belly like she’d done to Gil.
Thankfully, the constant patter of a wispy rain was helping to keep him grounded. And, dare he think it, Meskalim looked somehow pretty in the gray light of a sun shining though rain clouds.
Surely, though, this beauty was the work of the burgeons. Mandri had seen his reflection in a puddle, and his pupils were blown so wide that the smallest slight of light could get in there, bounce around, and blind him to all ugliness. Every surface sparkled. The falling rain dazzled. Even the cool muck welling up between his toes as he splashed along Meskalim’s streets was flecked with radiant light.
The more Mandri drank, the more he became convinced that this was more than burgeons playing with light and wetness. It seemed as if the sparkling bits of light themselves were tangible, like he could get them glommed up in between his fingertips and lick them, and perhaps this oily celestial film that coated every surface was always there it took burgeonsight to see it.
He lingered in the middle of an empty crossroad, surrounded by some of the blobbiest mud-caked slums in all of Meskalim. Each roof was topped off with little nipple chimneys and there wasn’t a wooden door in sight—only rags hanging down to cover their lamplit thresholds. Mandrameen stood, motionless, back hunched, hair drenched, brown robe slipping off his shoulder, for he was struck dumb by the sight of his own hand.
He held it up and studied it, for his own skin was sparkling. In the hollow of his palm was a pool of that starry substance. He tried to touch the little sparkles, tried to rub them off, but that was no good because his fingers were sparkling too. It wasn’t wetness, he was sure of it.
He licked his index finger and a heavenly sensation flooded into into his mouth. It was a tingling flavor that tasted like honey mixed with the vigor of youth. It tasted like the smell of a field of wildflowers. It tasted like apple-juice mixed with god.
He squealed with delight. 
He bent down and scraped up a dollop of mud with his finger, then licked it. Again, his mouth was flooded with the flavor. 
He rushed over to the nearest mud-caked wall, where an awning protected some large clay pots from the rain. He knelt down and licked the handles, the rims, the bodies. Again he tasted that divine flavor. There was a little brown pup shivering behind one of these pots, and Mandri picked the little beast up by it’s scruff and licked it, and it, too, tasted of heaven.
He dropped the pup and opened his mouth to the sky and tried to lick the air to check if the air itself was suffused with this substance. His tongue was caught mid-curl when a disgusted voice shot out of the rain, saying, “Get lost you freak!”
Mandri spun around, feet sliding in the mud. He raised his hands to defend himself, but there was no one there, nothing but glistening mounds of mud, soggy rags, and the sound of rain plunking off the broken clay pots that piled up in every nook and cranny.
Mandri couldn’t see the Meskalimi eyes peeping out at him, but he could damn well feel them. These destitute people were hiding in their hovels of slop and they were judging him. They could not see what he saw. Their dim-sighted eyes could only see a too-skinny young man standing in the muck, hackles raised, licking the air like a maniac.
“You do not see what I see!” Mandri shouted.
“Get lost!”
 Mandri spun around again, trying to place the voice, then sort of hissed when he realized there might be more than one of them speaking out.
“I see Sol’s light!” he shouted.
“GET LOST!”
Mandri yelped and took off running.
He ran and ran, following the road wherever it was going. He stopped when he realized that he was liable to slip and crack his skull. He also realized he’d dropped his beer-skin somewhere along the way. He thought about going back and trying to find it, but that wasn’t possible, because he didn’t know where he was and what paths he’d taken to get here. 
There is one way to orient oneself inside Meskalim—memorize all the faces of Meskalim’s central hill. The hill towered over the rumps and clumps of mud that was the city proper. The hill itself was studded with proper white buildings, each clinging to the hill like barnacles on a washed up corpse. These were the various offices of Hrkan government, as well as the mansions of the people who staffed them. It just so happened that when Mandri looked up at Meskalim’s hill, he was looking at the house of Salavan Soreen. As governor of Meskalim, Salavan’s house claimed a privileged vista at the top of the hill’s southern cliff face. Its wide balcony leered over the rest of the city below, and over Mandri, reminding him what he was supposed to be doing. 
He set off at a stuttering trot.
Along the way he stole a knife, because who leaves a stout little knife laying outside in a bowl of kakanut shells? Someone who wants it stolen, that’s who. Mandri simply complied. He also needed it more, so by divine right it was his. 
He knotted the knife up in the folds of his robe that hung loose around his waist, and he found that if he bent forward a bit, then the bulge of the knife’s handle would get lost amongst the folds. So he walked, stooping a little, all the way up Meskalim’s hill. It was hard trudging. His legs were completely out of wire when he came upon Salavan’s house. The damned thing was surrounded by a monstrous white wall. If he was going to kill Meskalim’s governor, he needed it to move.
Mandri hated walls. He’d always believed that walls had gone too far beyond their original scope. The first walls were knee-high stacks of stones set out in pastures to mark boundaries between goat herds—a pure and wholesome purpose. This wall, Salavan’s wall, was among the most perverse. It was huge, four-men tall, and its purpose was to stand there and look daunting so that poor people didn’t get any ideas. Most walls that big in a place as wet as Meskalim are streaked with black and yellow grime dripping to the street, but Salavan’s wall was pristine. Its plaster was as smooth and as white as the day it was slathered on. No doubt Salavan spent more money cleaning that wall than he spent on bread for widows and orphans, or for anything for anyone. That wall was more important than human life, more important than Mandri’s life. That wall’s raw materials could buy at least fifty Mandrameens. Its maintenance? At least five Mandris a year.
At least this wall was doing a job in keeping him out. Some walls on the lower rungs of Meskalim’s hill couldn’t keep out a flying shit. They’re purely decorative. Imagine that—a decorative wall—it’s not even trying to fend off the poors, all it's doing is letting them know they aren’t liked.
Mandri stood there in front of Salavan’s wall like an idiot. The burgeonsight was warping all the little dimples and scratches and faint finger-drags that were imprinted there in the plaster. Mandri couldn’t shake the feeling that the wall was daring him, like a schoolyard bully, to just try to breach it and see what happens.
There was a squared-out arch in the middle of this wall, and underneath this arch was an ironwood gate guarded by two thugs on either side. These brawny men were huddled close to the gate so as to squeeze themselves inside the narrow shelter of the arch. It wasn’t doing them much good. They were as sodden as Mandri. Like everything else, the burgeonsight was making them sparkle. That didn’t stop them from looking like demons.
In the best of light, a Meskalimi thug’s face is an unsettling thing. A lifetime of trading violence for money fixes a man’s expression into a state of permanent concern, and once the brow and cheek gets slashed with scars, the whole thing takes on a look of putrefied misery. Blur that face a little with rain, twist it a little with burgeonsight, and now it’s a demon’s face that could bend the bravest spine. And that’s what Mandri saw when he looked at those two thugs guarding Salavan’s gate, he saw full-blooded demons.
And they had swords—short, street-wise swords clipped high up on the belt.
Mandri believed that his burgeonsight, waning though it was, revealed the truth and showed these ‘men’ for what they were—actual demons. They couldn’t be full-fledged demons, because such demons should be tasked with more important things than watching a gate. They would be greasing the feet of backsliding priests, or tricking young beauties into thinking that taking it up the bum doesn’t count.
It then occurred to Mandri that he didn’t know why he was actually going through with all this. Ostensibly, he was here to placate the fury of a demon witch, but until this moment, standing in front of this stupid white wall, he hadn’t actually considered the possibility of not showing up. Pell had told him to go and see Salavan, and now here he was, seeing about Salavan. 
Perhaps he wasn’t fully in control of his own faculties.
Perhaps Pell had puppeteered him.
Or perhaps it was the burgeons.
One of the demons peeked out from under the arch and shouted, “Hey—scram, boy!”
“Git yous butt gawn,” the other said. His vowels were as stubborn as a mule.
Do demons have regional accents?
It sounded like this demon grew up in a sun-slum near Iskabat.
The first demon had no doubt crawled out of a Jeketian gutter, for his lilt and swagger could only have come from someone steeped in the capital of the Hrkan world.
Mandri caught his wits and said, “I’m here to see Salavan Soreen.”
The two demons looked at each other. A whispered word was shared.
The first of them asked, “Why?”
The other asked, “Whatchu gawtta knife fur?”
Mandri looked down and saw that he was gripping his knife so tight that his knuckles were white. 
“Oh...uh…sorry.”
The demon from Iskabat pulled his short sword from its scabbard and he brandished it at Mandri. 
He said, “Cuhm an get dem feengahs cut.”
Mandri stepped back and waved his hands in clear submission. He said, “I’m here because Pell sent me.”
“Pell sent you?” the Jeketian demon asked.
Mandri nodded.
“What’s your name?”
“Mandrameen.”
The Iskabati demon grunted and the Jeketian slouched back against the gate. Evidently, they had been expecting him.
The Iskabati waved his sword and said, “Poop thuh lil’ hippy.”
“What?”
“Drop the knife,” said the Jeketian.
“Why?”
“Are you dumb? You’re not getting inside with a knife.”
It seemed unwise to give up the knife. If Mandri handed it over and passed through the gate he’d be ambling into the clutches of a Salavan without the means to defend himself.
Probably, he would die. 
But what good was a Mandri wielded knife against a demon king?
He’d die with or without it.
He could run away.
But where would he go? He would probably die in a gutter within a week.
If there were alternative options, Mandri couldn’t see them because burgeonsight has a rooting effect, it roots a person into the present, makes it hard to see into the future. There were an infinite number of possible paths his life’s direction could take, and presumably some of these didn’t lead to a quick death. Burgeonsight narrowed it down to just one—go through the gate.
Some people say that this is why burgeons are bad for a person’s Spark. They say that burgeons make people ignorant of the future and so they don’t plan for it, and the next thing that happens is a ruined life. Mandri would argue that everyone walks through life’s infinite possibilities with their eyes set on a narrow array of options, so if sober people are ignoring an effective infinity, what’s the harm in taking a burgeon to ignore a couple more? At least he wasn’t trying to build walls, those literal embodiments of the restriction of possibility. What’s worse than burgeons is building a wall and funneling only the ‘good’ things through the gate. These people are higher on fear than Mandri had ever been on burgeons.
He dropped the knife.
The Hrkan demon opened the gate’s cutout door and motioned Mandri in.
The door clanged behind him, and a shiver ran through his spine.
It’s amazing how fast he could come to regret a decision.</Text>

            <Title>Dead Lizard</Title>
            <Text>The first object of note was the half-buried corpse of a large lizard, maybe half Mandri’s size. It was freshly dead from the storm, though it didn’t look like it, as most of its flesh had been stripped from the bone. What was left was being torn up by a small horde of flying beetles that looked like green jewels. Seb briefly stopped to collect as many of these beetles as she could. She offered one to Mandri, but Mandri declined.
Seb said, “They’re good chewin’, but I don’t got the teeth for ‘em anymore.” She proceeded to suck out the beetle’s innards through its rump like it were an oyster.
A few feet away from this dead lizard was a living one of the same species. Moteah called it a garool, and she said they slept unstirred under the sand for months until a rain came, and they’d wake up, mate, lay eggs, feast, then return to their quiescence. A charmed life, if not for the fact that this one’s partner was dead.</Text>

            <Text>On the sixth day, or was it the seventh? On the seventh day, they crossed a charnel road, and on the other side of it was a small rock cairn splattered with white paint. This marked the grave of a pilgrim. An epitaph had been written on a stick of wood and stuck in the ground right next to it, but the writing had been scoured into illegibility.
No one knew which shrine the charnel road led to, or from which city the road began.</Text>

            <Title>Misanthrope Obo</Title>
            <Text>This was the common thread to Obo’s daily gibes—he didn’t think highly of humans. As the days wore on he talked more and more about what people got up to without the guiding light of the Hrkan world.
He spoke of how, in the distant age of temple cities, there was an Old Jandri custom that forbade anyone from selling land. The purpose was good-natured, as the wise sages of those cities had enough history to know what causes a city’s collapse, for wealth attracts wealth just as sand attracts sand, and inevitably the wealthiest end up with everything—all the money, and all the land. Since the people have nothing, they either leave or simply rebel. 
To combat this, the city sages decided to prevent the sale of land so that a family could persist for generations regardless of what the rich wolves were up to. Land could be had only through inheritance. If a childless couple found their work too heavy in their old age, they could adopt a few straight-backed persons to till their fields and reap the harvests, and these children could stand to inherit on the condition that they provided grain, oil, and clothes to their adoptive parents for as long as the old folks lived.
But the rich were too clever for it. Judges were bribed, councils were captured, and by hook or by crook they weasled their way into the lines of succession. This practice carried on for more than one hundred years in the heart of Old Jandri. What began as a few rich, wicked schemers evolved into wicked consortiums of ‘sons’ who shared pools of silver and gold from which poor landowners were forced to turn to in times of drought, signing over the birthright of their trueborn children to the rich. Such was the depravity that a single man was once the adopted child of five-hundred and fifty-two different sets of parents. 
According to Obo, this was the birth of the Old Jandri banking system. The pretense of adoption was shed and more sophisticated systems of accumulation were devised. It wasn’t overthrown until the Hrks came and put a stop to it.</Text>

            <Title>Seb the Servant</Title>
            <Text>Seb waved a hand over Mandri’s sightless eyes. The boy was catatonic, limbs limp on the cold stone floor. She leaned over Mandri’s face and she could see the boy’s pupils flicker as his mind fell deeper and deeper into the trance of the God’s Eye burgeon. 
What sights did he see?
Seb had taken God’s Eye three times. She could never recall exactly what had occurred. There was only the sense that her Spark had blossomed and then burst, and she felt like she’d died and risen again. What lingered was the shadow of a memory, a feeling of brushing up against omniscience. That sensation was enough, sometimes, to sustain the illusion that she had finally killed her Self for good, but one night’s sleep and she was back to normal.
Always back to normal.
She sometimes didn’t like God’s Eye burgeons because of that. It was like treating a beggar to a Lord’s feast and kicking him out onto the street again. Seb thought it was better to starve.
Seb folded Mandri’s arms over his sweating chest so that the boy didn’t look so much like he was dead. That ended up making Mandri look more like a corpse, arms crossed over like that, so Seb undid the arms and sighed.
Should she cross his arms, or shouldn’t she?
This arms-crossing business was indicative of a deeper problem. If whatever she does is what she was meant to do, then why worry about it?
She worried because she couldn’t help herself from worrying. Whatever she did was what she was meant to do, and that included worrying about what she was meant to do.
What worried her most was that she could do nothing—never speak, never move, never feel—and that, too, would be what she was supposed to do. She could kill her body and that would be right, even though it was wrong. It was a damned if she did, damned if she did situation. There was no room in it for reason.
She took a deep breath.
She thought about licking a slice of burgeon.
Just one lick. Maybe one drop on the tip of the tongue.
She knew she shouldn’t, because Pel would be here soon.
But what if she did?
If she did, then that’s what was supposed to happen, and Pel couldn’t be mad about that.
Pel would be mad, but she shouldn’t be.
If Pel were mad, that was fine, too. And she herself couldn’t be mad about Pel getting mad. Unless she did get mad.
Seb sighed again.
She sat back down in the blackwood chair and leaned back as far as it allowed, which wasn’t far at all. She let her eyelids droop and tried to empty her thoughts as she stared into the fire.
Be nothing, like a rock is nothing.
Think about nothing 
Don’t think about nothing—have no thoughts.
And avoid, at all costs, those bubbling expectations. 
She began to hum. Humming helped to push the threat of thought into his mind’s crowded periphery.
“MMMMmmmmmmm…”
“MMMmmmmm…”
“MMMMMmmmmm…”
Seb stayed that way in front of the fire, humming like a lizard in heat, almost as lost in the sauce of nothingness as Mandri was, and just as she began to nod asleep, an old, distinguished woman’s voice echoed into the cave.
“My troubled Seb,” the voice said. “What troubles my troubled Seb?”
Seb twisted around in her chair, and the rock wall behind melted open to reveal a tall, thin woman draped in a black curtain of a robe. A ruffled shawl framed her stern face neatly. Her thin lips spread into a smile. She was Pel, terrifying to most who bear her witness, but to Seb she was a beauty, smart and austere, a witch from which she could define her purpose.
“Well?” Pel asked. “What has so enthralled the mind of Seb?”
Seb jumped out of her chair and cast herself down at Pel’s feet. Her forehead bumped hard on the rock. “Nothin’, my lady. I wasn’t thinkin’ of nothin’.”
“Mm-hmm.”
Pel’s voice had a way of benevolence, even when she was suspicious—especially when she was suspicious, for she delighted in being deceived.
“And I see you’ve found a fool.”
“Yes.”
“A fool I’ve seen before.”
Pel glided over to the catatonic Mandri. Recognition flashed in her eyes. “You should have seen this one’s face when I swallowed his Ox’s Spark. Salavan was convinced he would make a fine champion for our Lord.”
Seb scuttled around to face her mistress, and as she did, Pel’s gentle hand came to rest upon her shoulder. At Pel’s touch, all the tension in Seb’s body evaporated, and she gasped.
“That’s better, isn’t it?” Pel said. Her voice could soothe the hardest Spark. When she turned her attention back to Mandri, Seb grew jealous.
“I found him dead in the Junei hills,” Seb said.
“I know,” said Pel. 
“Elrahet made him a Mazid’s Minder. She seen’t somethin’ in him, an’ I thought…”
“You have been faithful,” Pel said before singing Seb’s name in a doting swerve, “Seb, Seb, Seb.” Her fingers alighted upon Seb’s bony back and Seb shivered.
“My child,” she said as she kneaded with practiced care. “It’s been too long.”
Seb melted under Pel’s touch. The witch’s hands pushed and spread Seb’s thin muscles like dough over her spine and ribs. Pel built the pressure in waves, a rising tide of tenderness. 
“Your faith warrants a boon,” Pel said. “Ask and you shall receive.”
Seb bit her lip.
“I wish to see as you see.”
Pel’s massage stopped with a sudden jerk, and the comfort spreading through Seb’s whole body snapped.
“You know that gift is not for you.”
Seb’s eyes welled up with tears.
“I know it, but…”
“Why would you ask? Don’t tell me…I wonder…Oh, my...”
Seb sneaked a peek at her lady, who was eying the boy on the floor as if seeing something for the first time. 
“My, oh my,” Pel muttered in surprise.
She reached into her robes and pulled out a brown paper booklet. Seb had seen it before, as Pel pulled it out anytime she needed to consult her visions of the future. She flipped to a blank page and gasped. Her excitement grew as her eyes flicked between the book’s rough pulp pages and the body on the floor.
“Seb, you are brilliant!”
“Thank you,” Seb said, not knowing what for.
“But why would she… perhaps she doesn’t see it?”
Pel knelt down beside the boy. She sat in contemplative silence for a whole finger, staring at his stomach. Then her arms flew into some witchy ritual motion, and she stretched out her hands and appeared to brush the air. She rolled her fingers several times as if combing invisible hair. She pinched a spot of nothing between her finger and thumb and dragged it out.
Though Seb could not see it, she knew that Pel was pinching a thread of fate, and she watched in awe as Pel pulled out her golden knife and cut it.
Once this was done, Pel shuffled around to the boy’s other side, and she said to Seb, “I want you to watch this.”
Seb had been peeking the whole time, but now she lifted her eyes. There was her lady, kneeling next to Mandri’s head but looking at her. Pel’s keen eyes could penetrate right through Seb’s Self and see the Spark. In Pel’s hand was a near empty vial of a shimmering, iridescent fluid—the last few tears of Schisol.
“This is not for you,” she said. “Never ask again.”
Seb wanted to arch her neck and scream about unfairness, and reading her mind, Pel answered, “Would you know what to do with it?”
Seb lowered her gaze in shame, for Pel was right. Pel was always right, though that didn’t make Seb feel any better. She wanted to smash her skull against the rock, and when she heard the pop of the vial’s cork she almost did it.
“The Amalgamete will soothe your sorrow,” Pel said, unclear as to whether she was speaking to Seb or Mandri. She administered one of Schisol’s tears to each of Mandri’s eyes. “Until that day comes, you will have to settle for my blessing.”
Pel stood up with graceful airs and glided over to Seb. She stooped, reached all the way down, and lifted Seb’s chin with her graceful finger. Pel’s crone nose and aged skin belied an unfathomable beauty.
The truth was in her eyes.
The truth was in her kiss.
The touch of her lips upon the forehead filled Seb with amazement, for Pel implanted a warmth that spread through the whole body like a wave, radiating out until every single inch of Seb was enveloped in a loving embrace. What Pel chased out was loneliness. What she undid was the knot in the stomach which Seb never could untie. Only her kiss could do this. Only Schisol’s memory, through her, could do this. And for the briefest moment, an exalted breath, Seb felt truly whole. 
She could not contain her wonder, and her dirty cheeks ran wet with tears.
“Feel better?” Pel asked.
“I do.”
The moment Pel removed her finger from Seb’s chin, the spell was broken, and Seb returned her head to the floor where it belonged. The chill of the stone was startling. Like the come-down from the God’s Eye burgeon, the same-old Seb flooded in. She would have wept if it weren’t for her lady’s aura of resolve.
Pel then sat down in the chair and the fabric squeaked tight against its wooden frame.
 “Now tell me, what has Elrahet said about this boy you’ve brought me?”
“The Ayramun have captured a Mazid.”
“That is not what I asked.”
“But they got a Mazid!” Seb exclaimed, lamenting her role in the Mazid’s capture. “They plan to hunt the ‘malgamete!”
“And they shall perish.”
“Ayram don’t think so.”
“I do not care what the brute thinks—Elrahet is the one with eyes. Is she optimistic?”
Seb scraped her head against the rock. “Elrahet don’t speak to me.”
“What of her mood?”
“I try, and I try, and I try, but she don’t speak to me.”
The silence that followed frightened Seb, so she felt compelled to share some hopeful news. “The Hrks have these things called Riga which can hunt a Mazid down to anywhere. They’ll catch Ayram and Elrahet before they ever reach the bones of Bullr.”
The fire crackled, and Pel settled deeper into her chair. She crossed legs and set her free foot bobbing up and down. All the while she stared at Mandri.
“I think it would be best,” she finally said, “If they find the Amalgamete much sooner than they want to.”
“Why?”
Seb cringed in embarrassment for asking a question.
Pel let loose a deep sigh. “I worry about you, Seb. You are like a weed. Every time I pull you out of your body, you grow right back.”
“I’m sorry,” Seb whimpered. “I meant to say, what do you want me to do?”
“That’s better.”
Pel thought for another finger more, watching the flames, and every now and then consulting her book. “What I want you to do,” she finally said, “Is convince Ayram to change his plans. Have him head further south for the Goree Pass.”
“Why the Pass? I mean—yes, I will. But…Ayram won’t hear me, not on somethin’ like that. He barely hears Elrahet. Goin’ to the Pass would add two days of walkin’ for no gain.”
“I will help with that. You plant the seed in that barren skull of his, and I will make it blossom.”
“What about the boy?”
“What of him?”
Seb winced at her own insolence—she had no need to know anything. Pel would never waste Schisol’s tears on someone who was not worthy of them.
“Seb, you are precious,” Pel cooed. “In all my life I’ve never had a servant such as you, so close to the enemy. But even so, I wonder, are you afraid to die?”
Pel’s gentle voice was reassuring to Seb’s ear. And as Seb knew that Pel could read every quiver in her body, so she told the truth.
“Yes, I fear death.” The words came out with a sob.
“Now, now,” Pel replied. “You’ve done more for the Amalgamete than most. You are special, Seb. Should I say it again? You are special.”
“No I’m not!” Seb wailed. Her whole body was wracked by shame.
“That’s what makes you special,” Pel said, brimming with earnest concern. “Your hatred for yourself is a subtle righteousness. You know this. You know that all of life is a mistake, and that our Sparks belong together. That is why you are who you are—no one else would do. Only you could be right here, right now. So give thanks, Seb, and be glad. You could have been one of the nameless number doomed to be severed from the Whole.” 
Nothing Seb could say or do could express the extent to which she appreciated these words, so she stayed low and prostrated herself further, then whispered a prayer to the Amalgamete, a prayer of hope and wonder.
Pel was contented to hear it.
“Now,” Pel said. “I have a storm to summon.”
She stood up and walked over to the cavern slit and whistled. Her whistle awoke something in the darkness there, something which Seb could not see but could hear—an ominous thumping echo marching towards the room. Then came a grumbling growl, then a belly-rumbling snort, and then the scratching swish of a giant lizard’s tail sweeping over rock.
The scaled snout that pierced the veil of darkness near Pel’s thigh was red as red can be. It swayed from side to side, forked-tongue licking the air.
“Come on out,” Pel said with a wondrous lilt, as if she were talking to a child. 
The lizard’s bloody red head swung into the room. Its wide skull was nearly as long as Seb’s arm, and its slitted orange eyes were sunk behind an angry, ridged brow. Whatever teeth it had were hidden under jowls, but Seb knew what they looked like, for this was a man-eater, a juvenile keenkedra. Everyone on the Jandri continent knew the keenki’s teeth—short stubby fangs that were barely there because if they were any longer that would make it harder for the beast to swallow a wriggling man whole.
Aside from its dietary habits, keenkis were known for their size, their rich red color, and their characteristic short-armed shuffle. The crook of this particular lizard’s back came up to Pel’s waist—if it were an adult it would not have been able to squeeze into the room.
Pel gave it a friendly brush with the back of her knuckles, and the creature crawled beside her and nuzzled up against her leg. It raised its stiff neck for a good old scratch, which Pel was happy to provide. Her magic managed to coax a low humming growl of contentment. Seb thought she saw a smile. Then, suddenly, the beast was looking at her, bearing an expression akin to alarm, as if the creature had only now noticed Seb’s existence.
“Move the boy out of the way,” Pel said, and Seb did as her lady commanded, careful to make no sudden movements. Then Pel led the beast further into the room and she lay it down, belly facing the fire. Its long whip tail swished excitement against the floor. 
 Seb marveled at Pel’s control. Elrahet could only dream of conjuring up such a beast for sacrifice, and even then, she’d have trouble with flailing limbs. Pel’s lizard didn’t flinch an inch when she drew her knife and stabbed its gut, and it merely sighed as she thrust her arm into its stomach and felt around for its Spark.
The storm this sacrifice would conjure would be immense.</Text>

            <Title>Goree Pass</Title>
            <Text>The creation and the curse of the Goree Pass is a simple story. An ancient tribe, called the Solgruin, asked Solraheen to split the Goree mountains so that their overland journey east would be made easier. Solraheen denied them, for He did not want to destroy any part of His creation just to accommodate trade. But the Solgruin asked again, and again, and on the fourth asking, Solraheen lost His patience. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there He stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
The curse he spoke was heard by every ear in all the world.
“Look upon this scar which mars My creation and hate your selfish ways. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, but so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
Mandri loved this story. It was one of his favorites. Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin, and Mandri used it as justification to rip up a painting to spite a client. 
He’d only ever done it once, but what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a month and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the barbarian King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would walk through her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a barbaric outland King on a richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, “That looks just like your Pookum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Pookum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with a righteous fury, as that unfamiliar euphoria motivated him to tear the painting completely in half, which he did, and he did it right in front of that cursed woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have killed that woman, just as Solraheen killed those who journeyed the Goree Pass. Well, Solraheen didn’t kill them exactly, He cursed them.
Curses, it turns out, can be avoided through sheer reason. Solraheen said, “Cursed are you who pass through it,” and it was argued that He meant the ‘you’ to be a restrictive ‘you’ which refers only to the Solgruin. Everyone else could pass through fine, and pass through they did. After all, here was Mandri and the Ayramun, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the Pass. And people lived in the Pass, most notably the Greskalun, led by Greskal, an old Jandri tribe whose charge was to keep the pass free from anyone who had a single drop of Solgruin blood.
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, and further out was the black rock sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib from spreading out of control. 
The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen’s spite became, for the ground under Mandri’s feet grew uneven, and rocks popped up like roots to trip him. The Goree’s walls grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground. An eon of blasting sand rounded the edges of these cracks, pillowed the seams, giving the rock the appearance of being bloated with infection. Mandri’s mood dimmed at the sight of them—it was quite apparent that the place was cursed. 
Soon the Goree Pass was sighted in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree’s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Obo informed Mandri that this splinter was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the breadth of the Pass’s mouth, protecting against ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now, and had done so for centuries.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through a debris field from a mountain cleft exploding.
The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been impossible to believe if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Solraheen standing up on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the dusty wind. A god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe to set the mountains quaking, bursting, and out would come a torrent of stones the size of houses. In the blink of an eye, a long sliver of the mountain would be reduced to rubble.
The Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram walked with a bowed head, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his giant pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, as if his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—brooding and quiet.
Mandri was marching behind Seb, who was chewing her borcandi spines so hard that her jaw was going stiff. She had to sort of rub the spines between her stubby teeth instead of chew. And the woman wasn’t paying attention to where she was spitting her juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, she hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel above her.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted herself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Don’t disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me disrespect you?”
“You threaten a woman with her kneecaps, that’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“It was an accident.”
“And I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He was so irritated with the two of them that he doubled back. “Nobody talks from here on out. Nobody except me.”
Mandri asked, “Why? Is something wrong?”
“I said nobody talks.”
Ayram’s deep voice rumbled Mandri to his core. Obo was not so affected. He added, from behind Mandri’s ear, “The Hrks will be on us today.”
Ayram’s eyes went wide. “You can sense the Hrks?”
“I can,” said Obo, “But the Hrks aren’t who you should be worried about. It’s the Greskalun. Something’s happened to them.”
Seb groaned. “Can we gag the damn thing up?”
Ayram’s grave visage lingered on Obo a moment, unsure of how much he could trust the Mazid. Then he set off again towards the Pass, this time more cautiously, more careful to crouch and hide his bulk behind boulders.
By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. This once living mountain was dead and rotted through. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock, for they were as friable as the hardtack Mandri was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased—when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against the mountain’s foot, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the mountain were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread.
Then there was the black tower that poked out of the Pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower. And no bright Spark ever builds in black, though Mandri admitted that the tower’s blackness lent it monumental significance. So it was fitting, in a way, as the central task of a monument is to look like it doesn’t belong. The tall spike sticking out of the Pass did this quite comfortably. It marked a curse which did not belong.
Mandri feared he’d die on the approach, for the brittle rock above threatened to come galloping down upon him every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks as Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by the apparently invisible Hrkan pursuit. He pioneered a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo using a Mazidariga, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered for making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof that Obo was wrong about the Hrks, and that he was wrong about ‘something happening’ to the Greskalun. 
Then the Goree pass opened up before them.
The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle of the narrow pass. Stubby black stone walls filled the short gaps on either side of it. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s gate at its base, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that Obo was right—something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off towards the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb broke the rule of silence with a whisper. “Maybe they all retreated, went back to their temple.” Seb was so stressed out that she was chewing two spines at once and her words were garbled by a slosh of spit.
“Retreated from what?” Moteah asked.
“Don’t ask me,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Mandri.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “That could be! Happened before. That’s what pokes do when the pox gets on them, they run away then stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.” 
“I don’t think we should go in,” Mandri said, though he knew his opinion didn’t matter. He received several glares for his trouble. “It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since forever.”
“It is not cursed,” said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows. But as soon as he said the words, a black vulture appeared to melt out of the tower’s pointed roof. It hissed as it took flight.
“It’s only a bird,” Ayram muttered as they all watched the bird spread its long wings and ride a thermal high up into the air, where it wheeled in circles.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and soared up to join their brother’s holding pattern. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient curse.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Ayram, “Then the Hrks would have all choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The giant tried to maintain his stoic frown, but Mandri could see that the mood was affecting even him, which was perfectly understandable, for the strongest men have the most to lose from a curse, and a curse was not something they could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion that everything was going according to plan.
Ayram marched over to Mandri, and Mandri flinched, fearing that Ayram had somehow heard his thoughts.
“Take off your pack,” Ayram grumbled.
Mandri obediently swung Obo’s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it, set it down, and he squatted next to it so he could get a clear look at Obo’s face, or maybe it was so Obo could get a clear look at his—the man looked ready to kill.
“Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?” he asked. There was no room in his tone for games.
“No,” said Obo, as if the question were a bore. “You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. I know you outland pokes abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when—”
“The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.”
Obo set his sight on the tower itself. This was the first time he’d seen it, as he’d been stuck on Mandri’s back up until now. His face betrayed nothing.
He said, “If you are asking me if there’s an army of Hrkan Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. However, I do think your instincts are correct—what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter.”
Seb spat at Obo, and the loogie just missed his shoulder and splatted harmlessly against a rock. “Them Greskalun could be here. Pox, Hrks, drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” said Moteah, doubtfully.
Obo rolled his eyes at both women, and instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter. His elbows stretched his swaddling robe as he twisted around. Mandri couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight of it—Obo looked like a toddler trying to roll over, trying to get comfortable for a nap. With effort, Obo poked his right hand up out of the neck of his tightly wrapped robe, and he used it to widen the opening so that he could stick his whole pale arm through. Once done, he reached out behind him and grabbed a bone that was half buried in the dirt.
“Interesting bone, isn’t it?” he said. “I’m surprised it escaped your notice.”
Obo set the bone out before him, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.
“This is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.”
Seb stomped over and nudged it with her toe. “You find one bone and you think them dead? One bone in the ground? A bone in the ground ain’t unusual. Where else you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Let the Mazid speak,” said Ayram.
Obo nudged the bone so that it flipped over.
“This is an unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
He stroked the length of the bone’s fracture with a thin, white finger. It was a jagged fracture which stretched almost along the whole length of the bone, leaving the upturned half looking like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unfazed.
“Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that would be expected, because that’s how bones naturally break. A break like this—it’s not likely to happen accidentally.”
Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “So you say this person was killed? That’s not unusual.”
Mandri blurted out, “I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the Pass.”
“We’re not in the Pass.”
Obo said, “Whoever it was, however they died, that is not significant. What is significant, is that a blow to the leg would not crack the bone lengthwise like that. It could happen, but the chances of it occurring are exceedingly slim.”
“Get on with it,” Ayram grumbled.
“I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri ruin. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating each other. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone up so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside. Lizards can’t do this. Neither can dogs. They don’t have the hands for it.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with images of some grungy, sand-crusted cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his filed teeth.
Ayram held the bone out away from him as if it were diseased.
Elrahet waddled over and yanked the bone from his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the open socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone into Obo’s stumpy lap, and as it fell, Moteah shouted, “Look!”
She was pointing towards the tower’s gate, out of which Moto was sprinting. He sprinted at full speed, frenetic, as if being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust down there in the mouth of the Pass.
When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!” He looked over his shoulder and grimaced.
“Pick up the Mazid,” Ayram said to Mandri, and with that it was decided—Ayram would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower and its gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled, and bulging ever so slightly outward. Most of its bricks were chipped, some were twisted, some seemed to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The gate underneath was just as ominous, it was ten-men wide and its arch was fanged by metal teeth which would have scratched Ayram’s head if he did not duck. The gate tunnel was as long as the hall of a Hrkan Lord, cavernous enough to turn the thump of Ayram’s walking spear into an echoing beat. Aside from this steady meter, they passed through the dark in silence, casting wary glances at the empty door frames that pocketed either side.
Moto, who’d taken the lead, stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and the shadow of shadows passed over his face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it, and all around, stuck into the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were large wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
It was a desecration.
Such was the defilement that panic leapt into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. But he was rooted to the spot, for the horror robbed him of every faculty, and it set his stomach roiling in a terrible, growling fit.
The nearest wretch was only ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant pilgrim. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, lolled in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of Sol.
They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His broken scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor pilgrims littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.
Obo, with the use of his newly freed arm, hauled himself up onto Mandri’s shoulder to see for himself.
Mandri muttered, “What is this?” and for once, Obo had no answer.
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Seb, a woman who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil scene halfway through the tunnel, for she had not made it out into the courtyard. She was standing inside in the tunnel’s shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep as if her belly ached.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye towards his mournful band. He said, “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, even Hrkan pilgrims, but I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into her skin, and she said in turn, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? Sides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em ‘cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’.”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as she gestured at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them. “Moteah’s right.”
The stern assertion stunned them all back into silence, and Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the tunnel after the witch.
Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up as straight as her back allowed.
“Must have been the panic,” she said as she walked towards the courtyard. It seemed all her joints were aching, like every weary moment of the long journey was suddenly set upon her.
“Mere hate, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets a stomach growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light and surveyed the courtyard with a spiteful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? You have sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I don’t know what you—”
“PANIC!” Elrahet shrieked. “Panic sets its stomach growling. Panic wakes it up.”
“Wakes what up?” Mandri asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled.
“The Amalgamete.”
The graveled word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a rock aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“Was the Amalgamete that did this,” the witch declared. “A man who became the Amalgamete.”
Ayram, still composed, said, “We’ll do what we can for them, then we leave.”
“Nothing we can do can help these grim pilgrims.”
Seb spat her agreement onto the courtyard brick and said flatly, “Dead is dead.”
“They are not dead,” said Elrahet, sneering.
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim. He’d seen enough of death to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive.
On second glance the pilgrim’s wounds were quite peculiar. The strip of missing skin on the outside of his thigh was circumscribed by white-pink rings of fresh skin.
Fresh skin…
Still growing…
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered. Mandri sprang back just as the man’s ruined head jerked up, tossing a spill of blood at Mandri’s feet. The pilgrim’s tongue twisted out of his yawning mouth as he tried in vain to grasp a wet breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs. He wheezed and gulped, and his chest heaved against the rope of thorns, but in the end his eyes rolled back and his whole body went limp and quiet.
“His very Spark is bound to the pole,” Elrahet explained. She seemed unable to look upon the pilgrim. “He will die, and die, and die again.” Her bottom lip quivered, and she seemed about to explode in rage, then she then stamped her cane into the ground and proclaimed, “This is not safe! We must leave at once!”
She hobbled back into the tunnel.
Moto was the first to follow. Then Ayram and Moteah. Mandri joined them in the shadow of the tower and was glad to be gone from that courtyard.
Seb remained.
“Hold on,” she said, indignant. “We’re goin’ back!? What about the Greskalun?” She jabbed an open hand towards the dark rent in the mountains behind, as if the Greskalun were right there and the others only had to squint a little to see them.
“There are no Greskalun,” Moteah said again.
But Seb stood her ground. “You can’t know that ‘til we go and have a look! We at least got to look!”
“That Pass is cursed!” Moto exclaimed, but Seb merely crossed her arms and argued, “Can’t be worse than Hrks.” 
Then, from the desert, there came a sharp and roaring bleat—the Hrkan horn of war.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommm

The call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and all eyes raced westward, for there in the distance was a speck of man set against the glare of the desert. All that could be made of him were the familiar blue robes of a Hrkan scribe. At his side was a shorter figure wrapped in black, a Mazidariga, and behind them, from around the sprawling tumble of the Goree’s shattered stones, was a double-column of white robed soldiers marching in even squares.
“RUN!” Ayram roared, and if that wasn’t enough to prod Mandri into motion, the Mazidariga’s warbling whistle split the air, sending Obo into convulsions inside his litter. 
Mandri turned and ran through the accursed courtyard, weaving a route around the pilgrim poles and up the courtyard slope. There the whistle pitched into a mind splitting squeal. Mandri dropped to his knees. He cowered against the sound, and he prayed a broken prayer between gasps as Obo’s psuedospark was stolen.
When the whistling stopped, Mandri shrugged himself out of the litter’s straps and turned around to discover that Obo had gone limp.
Moteah ran right by him.
So did Moto.
Mandri shouted, “They got Obo!” 
Seb as she passed by and she shouted back, “Get runnin’ or you’re next!”
Mandri picked the litter back up and ran. Ayram came galloping by with Elrahet clinging to his pack like a spider. 
“Hurry!” she screeched. She climbed over Ayram’s pack to ride his shoulders as he overtook the file and led the flight into the dark heart of the Goree Pass.</Text>
            <Notes>OBO NEVER SAYS HE BELIEVES

Need to knock Obo unconscious here.


The more you listen to someone, the more they use the word ‘they’ the more likely their full of shit.

It was a metallic, tinny tone that quivered like a strandtail’s warble, only it was ten times louder and harsher than any shriek any bird could ever make. That damned sound cut through the rock so clearly that its source might as well have been in the room. For Mandri, it was an ear-splitting pain, but to Obo it was doing something stranger.</Notes>

            <Title>Succor of Salt</Title>
            <Text>They slept, each noon, for five hands. They propped up woolen blankets on bushes for shade, and Mandri was allowed to share one of these with Purl. He could hear Purl breathing, feel her warmth, and despite that, there was no pounding lust in his ears. Unusual for Mandri. He told Obo about it, because by now they were sharing most thoughts with each other, and Obo said the Hrkan hardtack Mandri was eating was mixed with succor of salt. Succor of salt is an anaphrodisiac. It curbs the libido. The Lords don’t want their troops rubbing uglies when they’ve got more important things to do..
Mandri resolved to eat no more of the hardtack, but changed his mind when Obo forced him to consider the alternative—he’d be out here in the Sand, lust pounding away, uglies alert, with no real way to find release.</Text>

Mandri followed Elrahet down into a meandering maze of close-felt darkness. The air was alive the sounds of footfalls and heavy breathing, some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight—no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons just waiting for a chance to strike. Then Elrahet turned a tight corner and passed underneath an unassuming gray stone frame with out so much as a shrug.
This door frame had perfectly plumb and squared columns.
Unfamiliar symbols were scratched into its posts.
Mandri hesitated.
Purl hustled past him with an annoyed shoulder.
Moteah ran right along. She assumed Mandri was too weak to keep up with the pace. “There’s no time for rest,” she said as she disappeared into the dark.
Moto, who’d taken up responsibility for the rear of their little file as they shuffled through the dark, paused before this doorless threshold. It was clear from his worried expression that the language was foreign to him. He muttered a prayer and kept on marching, and when Mandri lost sight of light of the man’s torch, he dared a whisper to Obo, who still sat in his pack.
“Obo,” he said.
“What?”
“What do you know about Shis?”
“There are too many conflicting stories,” Obo said.
Mandri waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock. “Can you read this?”
Obo climbed out of Mandri’s pack to peek over Mandri’s shoulder and get a gander.
“It’s Schisol’s screed,” he said.
“I knew it.”

Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth. 
Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right.
Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.
Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be together.

“We should keep moving, Mandri.”
“Why? They’re casually strolling down into Shis—and why? Because Elrahet said so? She could be leading us to a slaughter.”
The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of symbols. Mandri dared to reach out and touch them, and he found there wasn’t a single speck of dust polluting the grooves. Either they’d been cut yesterday, or someone was washing the rock.
“Mandri,” said Obo, “Whatever’s down here, I’ll handle it.”
Moteah’s voice came bounding out of the dark tunnel ahead.
“MANDRI!”
Obo shouted back, “We’re coming!”, and then he gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder.
Mandri stepped through the gate.
What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone threshold made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with a few thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs and that was it. And this path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. Elrahet and the others were creeping along this treacherous brink, with only a few cutout handholds keeping them from certain death.
Once all the Ayramun had shimmied across, it was Mandri’s turn. He tried to move but his knees were locked in fear. His armpits were practically sweating rain despite the chill that blew up from the fissure.
Mandri looked at the ledge as it flickered in the torchlight. It was barely there.
“Come on,” said Moto from the other side.
Mandri tossed his torch across—he wasn’t about to try this with only one hand. Then he prayed a wordless prayer, stepped up to the abyss, and began to side-shuffle along the ledge. He was halfway across when a sliver of stone broke out from under his leading foot. He swayed out into the darkness, but he was able to pull himself against the rock wall and regained his balance, but he didn’t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the abyss, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up and nearly knocking Mandri loose. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him.
They journeyed on and the rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. The walls were so narrow in places that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways, dragging his Obo laden pack behind like a stubborn dog. Elrahet marched through it all with purpose in her step. She spared no hesitation whenever a decision needed to be made about which dark and foreboding path to take. Mandri had expected this adventure under the earth would resemble their stumbling through the temple Shulgi—butting into dead ends and unremembered rooms, but that never happened. Elrahet had been here before.
She led them into a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill, and this left Mandri’s hands cold and clammy, and he started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself, for his torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable—hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows which he mistook for mere divots gave way to potholes to twist his ankle. And the longer it went on the less and less he cared about even these scrapes and bruises. He wondered if this malaise was a result of nearing to the core of Shis.
He measured out time by measuring the weariness in his legs. The start of soreness in his calves was a sign that it’d been at least four hands. Once the unremitting burn set into his thighs, well that marked at least a half-days journey. It was an accurate system, or so Mandri believed, because every time he reached the edge of giving up Elrahet stopped underneath a hang of rock and they rested, huddled around a small fire of twigs, though they rested only as long as it took for the fire to turn the twigs to ash. After the second rest like this, Mandri’s system of measurement was broke, because when they started out again his legs were already sore. 
 It wasn’t until the fourth march that Mandri’s shoes slapped onto paved floor. This came as a great surprise because the walls were still rough hewn, and his feet were so used to stubbing their toes against unsettling bumps, that finding themselves on a surface as flat as screeded sand challenged their whole sense of reality. It was grey clay tiling, and engraved along the border of each square tile was a jagged chain of thorns. This hall spilled out into a larger one, and this larger hall opened up into a cavern that was so large that its size was impossible to say. The entirety of this cavern floor was paved in those tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps the pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. It was unfamiliar design, like a flower with it’s petals closed, and though Mandri had never seen its like before he knew it was a sign of Schisol. 
The sound of their shuffling feet reverberated out into the emptiness, and they all hunched along as if sneaking. Mandri almost laughed at the sight of his skulking band, because if any nearby demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they’d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches. And they moved like this for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern’s end. They could go no further, for the grey stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a giant stone double-door that would take a team of oxen to open. These imposing doors were to sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures from which Batata had drawn inspiration. But these demons looked much more real when rendered in stone, and instead of whipping stick-figured humans, they were doing unmentionable things to men and women fully fleshed.
Set atop these doors was a stone head in flat relief, bald like Obo’s, and twice as unnerving because it seemed to be licking its lips at sight of Mandri’s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders, and the rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly arms stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door’s bottom hinges.
“Spark a fire,” said Elrahet as she eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn.
Moto unstrapped his pack and pulled out a handful broken twigs.
“More,” said Elrahet. “All of it. We might be waiting here a while.”
Mandri was thankful for the pause, though he wished Elrahet had picked a less conspicuous location. It seemed imprudent to make camp on the very doorstep of Shis, and judging from the nervous looks the others shared, he was not the only one to feel that way.
Moto recruited more wood from the others and set a campfire alight, making sure to keep a healthy distance away from the door. When that was done, he smothered everyone’s torch with the same rag that Obo had used to wipe himself clean of the Amalgamete’s stomach. Mandri, robbed of his own personal comfort flame, sat as close to the fire as he could. Meanwhile, Obo slid out of the litter to go and reflect upon the door.
The Mazyd stilted along on his nubby arms, a swiveling gait, a pitiful sight, yet Obo moved with an air of confidence, and he plopped himself down in before those terrifying doors so that Schisol’s head at the top was staring down right at him.
Obo said aloud, “Are we going to open it?”
“Open the doors of Shis!?” exclaimed Moto. “Are you mad?”
Moteah added, “What do you think you’ll find?”
“That’s why I want to open it,” said Obo as he studied the door’s manic display of torture. “I should very much like to see what all the fuss is about. After all, this is what we’ve come to see, isn’t it?”
All eyes turned to Elrahet, for only she knew what they were doing down here.
Elrahet pulled Moto’s pack aside so that she could sit on it and warm her bony knees by the fire. When she had settled, she said, “Come and sit. I’ve a story to tell that you all need to hear.”
Obo hurried over and sat down in the spot between Mandri and Purl. Moteah passed around a bag of jerked beef, while Moto was gracious enough to share a skin of beer—an unprecedented courtesy which led Mandri to wonder if this were a final meal. He chewed his food nervously as sounds echoed out of the cavern’s starless sky—faint drips water, the soft hiss of wind gusting up through some unseen shaft, the scuffle and shrieking squeak of a rat who’d met his end in the jaws of a silent hunter.
“My story begins at the Beginning,” Elrahet said, “When all existence belonged to a single Spark. Then Solrah came to be. No one knows how She came to be. Somehow, the Spark was pierced and Solrah bled out of it as sap bleeds out of a tree. Memory of Solrah survived through her son, Solraheen, for though Solrah died in childbirth, Solraheen inherited Her mind.
“This was the second age, when all that existed was Solraheen and the Spark. This age was, I believe, the longest of them all, though there were no days, and there were no years—there was no counting of time, and yet, well, it doesn’t matter. In the end, Solraheen grew lonely. He spoke the first word, and this word shattered the Spark, and from these fragments Solraheen created a garden world. He created land and sea for His enjoyment, and He created all manner of creatures for His companionship. He found this to be difficult, for the heat of the Spark withered stone and burned flesh and everything eventually died. But Solraheen was endlessly creative. He invented love, and in so doing he managed to tweak and bend the sacred Spark to defy death, for death was conquered with every new birth. He had created a creation which sustained itself—even created itself. Solraheen was proud, and like a proud parent he believed that His child should be free of His influence to continue on and define itself on its own terms. So he laid down to die, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, possessed by a different mind. This mind was none other than the mind of Schisol.”
Mandri hung tight to every word. This was not a telling he’d heard before. There were familiar elements, yes, but the telling was lured with heresy and forbidden knowledge, especially tantalizing was the suggestion that Solraheen and Schisol were of the same flesh.
“Schisol awoke into Solraheen’s body like a newborn babe—without knowledge of the world or even Himself, or even of Solrah who came before. He wandered His brother’s garden as confused as any of us ever did. As the ages passed His mind matured, and He felt the heat of Sparked creatures and saw how their every breath was a flame, how their bodies were burning, slowly, until death. He saw an endless cycle of loneliness and pain, and he came to believe that creation was a corruption, that all Sparks had been shattered from a single Spark, and that to cure loneliness and death they should be reunited again into an eternally happy whole, in perfect communion with each other. So He set about destroying the garden, killing all creatures and joining their Sparks together. It took Him a long millennia, but in the end He prevailed. The last thing to join together with the whole was Himself, and so He killed Himself, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, this time, in the possession of Solraheen.
“Solraheen awoke once again into a void next to the all-white Spark, and he saw that His creation had been erased. He had no memory of what had occurred while Schisol was in control of the body, and He had no memory of Schisol. He blamed Himself for His garden’s failure. Though His grief was immeasurable, He began His work again. This time He selected a number from amongst the creatures which roamed the earth and into them He invested Mind, so that they could, in His absence, act as stewards of all creation. These were the first humans, and they lived peaceably with each other, and they gave birth to Art, Philosophy, and a wondrous Civilization, so wondrous that Solraheen was once again satisfied again with His garden. As before, He laid down to rest so that His creation could come into its own, but instead of dying, His body rose again.
“Schisol,” Moto muttered in a breath of child-like wonder.
Elrahet nodded.
“Schisol awoke into His worst nightmare, for He saw that the all-white Spark had once again been split, and another miserable garden was blossoming, trapping all the splinters of the Spark into a never-ending cycle of dread and despair. Amongst the lonely creatures that roamed this garden were the saddest, loneliest, most terrifying creatures imaginable—humans. Then one day Schisol saw a man kill himself out of heartbreak, and instead of that man’s Spark being reinvested into the Spark-ensnaring cycle, the man’s Spark was lost forever, dimming the whole should it ever be put back together again. 
“Schisol set out again to destroy all creation. To hasten this end he explained to humanity their suffering, he taught them about the splitting of the Spark, and he enlisted their aid in destroying the rest of creation. But some humans remembered the teachings of Solraheen, they remembered that they did not want to die, and so they resisted. Schisol inflicted tortures upon them, but this pain instead invested them with tremendous power, and they became the lesser gods. These forces arrayed themselves against Schisol and His minions. A cataclysmic battle took place. Schisol Himself was slain. But he was not completely dead, his body arose again, centuries later, and again, Solraheen walked the earth.
“The world He walked was a land laid waste by war. He asked the struggling humans what had occurred, but He did not believe their stories, for some amongst them were liars, still under the sway of Schisol’s corrupted teachings even if they did not know it. Solraheen selected from amongst them a girl, one whom he trusted, and he gave her the gift of immortal life that she might act as His envoy, for He was concerned that if He were to die again, then His garden would become corrupted again. He did what he could to regenerate the world, but Schisol’s minions conspired to end Him. They summoned an Amalgamete, one much greater than Greskal, and this creature gave birth to the foulest of demons and it murdered Solraheen. But again, He did not die, not completely.
“He arose as Schisol, and Solraheen’s immortal envoy ran to Him, thinking, of course, that the He were Solraheen. It was then that the truth Their dual nature was revealed. Schisol learned that He Himself was responsible for all the suffering in this Garden, and His rage was boundless. Those were dark days, but when Schisol regained Himself, He came to believe that if he could communicate with Solraheen, He could convince Him that this garden was a perversion of the Spark, and that Solraheen would agree to put an end to all the senseless suffering. So, Schisol resolved to send a message to His twin brother—but as He did not trust Solraheen’s envoy to do the message justice, Schisol raised up a young woman for Himself and gave her eternal life. With her He shared His corrupted message, and then He ended Himself, that Solraheen might arise and learn the truth.
“Schisol’s envoy tried to convince Solraheen to destroy the world and reunite the Spark, but her message was ill received. Solraheen, in defiance of His brother’s wishes, regenerated the world anew. As you might guess, Schisol’s woman rallied Schisol’s minions, and they murdered Solraheen, and the world has been stuck in a cycling ever since. When Schisol lives, Solraheen’s blessed are martyred and their purified Sparks transform into gods who join together to undo Schisol’s terror. When Solraheen lives, Schisol’s minions raise up armies demons to undo Him. As you well know, we live in the age of Solraheen, but what has been done in this age has been done in no other—in a desperate attempt to end the cycle, Solraheen called down a piece of the void and trapped Himself underneath it, so as to forever forestall Schisol’s return. Even if He were to be killed, Schisol would awaken trapped underneath a mountain of Fabled Black.”
Obo spoke up and said, “I take that it didn’t work, else you wouldn’t need me to try and free Him.”
“Yes, it was a mistake. Solraheen hoped that with the battle over, that love and goodness would thrive and push Skisol’s minions back into their barrows under the earth. But He did not forsee what the Hrkan Lords would do to Him, or how they would twist his message. Without Solraheen’s guidance, Schisol’s creed has spread like weed, and I worry that when the next cycle comes, there won’t be enough righteous men and women to fight it.”
Elrahet stared longingly into the fire and the lines on her face grew deep. The others shared her contemplative stillness, for one cannot speak, or even think, when digesting a story as hers. Mandri chewed on his slip of beef and rummaged around his thoughts for a hint on how to feel about it—he’d heard too many world-explaining stories to be sure that Elrahet told the true, nonetheless, Elrahet had led him straight to the doors of Shis, so if anyone had such knowledge it should be her. A sign or confirmation, when suddenly, out of the darkness around him there arose a voice, a woman’s voice, a voice as old and rumbling as Elrahet’s.
“Welllllcome”, it said in a gnarled, as if it were inviting him to join the dead.
Mandri spun his back to fire and faced the cavernous void. He saw nothing and no one. Then came a grinding sound as stone slid against stone. The great doors of Shis were swiveling in their hinges. They swiveled inward, and they opened up a wide enough slit for a single figure to pass through—an old woman tall and graceful, robed in a single black sheet that draped down to the floor but did not touch, and as the woman moved towards the fire she seemed to float. Mandri recognized her instantly—it was Pell.
It was the demon-witch who’d killed is ox.
It was the dark priestess who’d set this  all into motion.
Both Moto and Moteah sprang up and drew their swords.
“Stay your hand!” Elrahet shouted. “She’s who we’ve come to see.” 
“Have you come to see me,” said Pell she drifted nearer, her long black robe reflecting a velvet sheen. “Or have you come to tell these people lies?”
“I told no lies,” Elrahet growled as she stood up with the help of her cane.
“Oh please,” said Pell, “You’re old enough to know that when you leave out important details, that’s as good as lying.”
Pell came to a halt a few yards away from the fire, careful not to enter the Ayramun’s circle. Moto and Moteah had yet to sheathe their swords.
“You know I could kill you all with a blink,” she said.
Moto’s hand tightened against the leather grip of his sword. Mandri knew swords were no use here, and that Moto, fast as he was, could not outswing the speed of that deceptive witch.
“She’s posturing,” Elrahet said as she made her way around the fire to confront her counterpart. She stood before the much taller witch and stamped her cane defiantly against the floor. “She and we have a truce.”
“We do,” said Pell. “Though I must admit, there’s always that lingering thought, isn’t there, that if I were to kill you one more time, it could be the death that sticks.”
Elrahet’s retort was grumble, to which Pell smiled and said, “If you’ve come to my door to offer yourselves to the slaughter, then I accept.”
“I said we’ve come to see you, and that’s all we’ve come to do. Seeing you is enough.”
Amusement flickered across Pell’s aged face.
“See me? That’s all? I know I’m beautiful, but to make such a journey to merely see me—it’s too flattering.”
“Some among us needed to see your evil for themselves.”
“Oh, I see.”
Pell’s imperious gaze turned to the others gathered around the fire, and especially Obo. She leered at him as a Lord leers at a broken man. 
 She said, “You’ve come to show off your new toy, is that it?”
“The Mazyd is no toy,” said Elrahet. “It’s as Sparked as you and me.”
The news shattered Pell’s smirk into a wrinkling frown. She spat at Obo, then regarded Elrahet anew with fury. “There’s no end to your perversions of the Spark, is there!? Still building abominations.”
“Abomination?” Elrahet snarled. “Speak of abomination, bitch—what of the poles in the Goree Pass?”
The mention of those accursed poles set Pell back at ease. She drew her lips tight and said, “You can hardly blame the demons. They’ve only been waiting five thousand years for these blessed days. That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You can feel it coming, can’t you? Despite all your travails in the Sand, you worry—it’s all been for nothing.”
“You do not see everything,” said Elrahet.
“Neither do you.”
“I see more than you.”
“Oh please, how could that possibly be true when your eyes have never grown accustomed to the dark?”
“We’ve killed your Amalgamete,” said Elrahet.
Pell deflected this triumph away with a wave of her hand. “I wasn’t referring to Greskal.”
Elrahet’s grin curdled into a scowl and Pell reveled in it. She then turned her attention to the Ayramun, savored their unease, and when her eyes finally alighted on Mandri she locked her gaze with his, and for a shuttered instant her true eyes flashed, bright and warm, golden threaded, declaring mystic tidings which Mandri could not being to comprehend—then she blinked and her eyes were dark again, she looked away, leaving Mandri to wonder if the others had caught it too.
“Gentle Sparks,” Pell said aloud, throwing her voice out into the cavern, “Would you please grace us with your presence?”
Her request fell into the black, and a moment later the black began stir. Mandri tried to rub the insanity out of his eyes, but yes, the black itself began to stir, and as it weaved and wound it squelched out growls and grated shrieks, then bright points of light emerged within it like jittering stars, and these stars mounded up, grew brighter, and as they did along came the the pitching laughter of demons—not just two, or three, or twenty, for that horde of stars resolved themselves into a horde of fire reflecting eyes—thousands of blinking eyes in a thousand different configurations—eyes set wide, bovine eyes, mousey eyes, eyes of giants, eight-fold sets of spider eyes swaying overhead, all of them hesitant to enter into the firelight, as if embarrassed of their own grotesquery. 
The first demon Mandri actually saw came ambling in and out of the dimness in a naked knuckle-walking strut. It was vaguely human, with a mouthless face that was scrunched towards the middle, as if its skin was being pulled into its nose. After this frightening sight, another set of glowing eyes stepped forth with confidence into the light, revealing a goat headed demon with black Zosan skin and a chiseled physique, and its feet were hooved as well. This demon was then joined by a circle of its horrid brethren, each leaping out, it seemed, from Mandri’s childhood dreams for there was every manner of mashed-up anatomy between man, insect, and beast. This circle of dread surrounded the Ayramun, a circle broken only by Pell and the doors of Shis behind her.
“You see,” Pell said to Elrahet, “You’ve spent so much time staring at Solraheen that His light has blinded you to what the world is becoming. Now, if you would, please leave, before I begin to forget the practical nature of our truce.”
Elrahet was stuck in shock at the sight of so great an evil—rank upon rank of evil. Her face was so that it seemed she’d just witnessed the very end of days. It was Purl who shook her out of this by saying her name, “Elrahet!”
The old witch snapped to and, 
“We leave!”
Everyone snatched up their packs and lit their torches in the campfire’s flame.
Obo did not move.
“Hold on,” he said to all. He stilted his way towards Pell so that she could see him clearly. He asked her, “These demons here, they want to kill me?”
“Nothing so crude,” said Pell. “They want to recover your Spark and add it to their own.”
One of the demons nearest Obo, a tusked woman with the body of a boar snarled and hissed, spraying Obo with its putrid spittle.
Pell said, “She wishes to put you back where you belong.”
Obo wiped his cheek and replied, “That is not acceptable.”
His blunt response jolted Pell into amazement. Her thin lips grew tight, her brows jumped, and then she burst into a tremendous fit of laughter which was taken up by her demon horde and escalated into terrifying noise that rivaled a peal of thunder.
“Oh, my, my!” she said. “Not acceptable?! My dear Mazyd, we have collected an uncountable number of Sparks throughout the ages—yours will be no different.”
“Of that uncountable number,” said Obo, “How many belonged to Mazyd?”
Pell stooped down to peer at Obo, hands on knees, as if she were lecturing a child.
“We have collected the Sparks of gods. I assure you, yours will be no different.”
“Then it seems a peaceable conclusion is not possible.”
“It never is.”
“Very well.”
Obo, , opened his mouth. A heartbeat later and his throat ran gold and fire poured out in a beam as bright as the sun, smashing through the air where Pell had been for she’d expected this turn, and disappeared into a flash of smoke before the heat could singe her. Obo’s blazing fire to smashed through this swirling cloud and it burned through the left door of Shis—such was its power that pushed through the stone as easily it would push through a slab of skin. Such was the dazzling brilliance of this roaring flame that it surprised even Obo.
“IDIOT!” Elrahet screamed as she swung her cane at Obo’s head. It smacked the Mazyd’s skull hard, but it was the cane that cracked.
“I didn’t know she could do that,” said Obo as he watched the smoke that was once a witch dissipate into nothingness. Mandri hoped for a moment that old witch might have, somehow, been vaporized by Obo’s power, but then her laugh echoed austere throughout the cavern.
“You’ve broken truce,” she said.
“Not me!” Elrahet replied.
But Pell was unforgiving. “You know the rules.”
The sea of demons began to chatter—teeth chatter, giggle chatter, yapping, sucking, squealing chatter—but they were all too timid to pounce. Then the black, goatheaded demon took a step forward, and this seemed to steel their spines.
Moteah, eyes wide in terror at a fish-headed bear giant looming tall above her, screamed, “You’ve doomed us!”
“Relax,” said Obo, “Someone give me a boost.”
Mandri ran to Obo, grabbed the Mazyd’s arm swung him up and onto the shoulder, where Obo, in this heightened state, tried to plead with the horde. “My dear fellows, if you wish to survive, then you will—”
His plea was cut short by the hunting shriek of a bat swooping overhead. This winged beast was the size of a child, with a child’s flat face and enormous funnel ears wrapping round its head to fan-frame its pea-sized eyes. It dropped out of the cavernous night like an arrow, its curved claws splayed and grasped, its round face contorted in anger—or maybe it was agony, for almost as soon as Mandri saw the creature its head was smashed by a roaring burst of mazydfire, a flame so hot it heated the whole head into incandescence and then it popped. The rest of the body burst into flames and hurtled overhead to crash into the crowd of demons behind. 
With the first blow struck, the army of Shis broke loose.
The demons came running, hopping, sliding, striding, galloping towards Mandri and the Ayramun. Their muscles bulged and their scales sparkled, their whiskered snouts and fanged maws hissed, their pointed beaks screamed for oblivion—but Obo’s golden mazydfire screamed back, it lashed out in two great sweeping arcs to cut down a circle around the Ayramun, obliterating the first rank of demons, cutting the confidence out of that goat-headed demon at the waist. Those that scurried underneath Obo’s sweeping flame—the dog, hog, and lizard demons, the beetle demons—these Obo dispatched with incredible precision and blinding speed as more than twenty blaring beams of flame blasted out of his mouth in space of a breath, vaporizing the head of each demented creature on contact, and when the mazydfire was gone their bodies burst whole into flame leaving a ring of sizzling, steaming flesh to serve as stumbling blocks to the rest of the onrushing horde. 
The Ayramun gathered close to Mandri, close to Obo, and they found safety there underneath his sweeping flame. Obo set himself proud on Mandri’s shoulder, and once all were near, his golden fury raged out again, this time spiraling round and round, cutting down hundreds, perhaps thousands, for at each rotation his mazydfire traveled further out, mowing down larger and larger swathes of demons, and as Obo’s golden beam swept through the dark it left in its wake a smattering of little explosions as all who fell combusted. All demons, no matter how large and fierce, fled before the slaughter. It was truly an awesome display of power, and it was sitting atop Mandri’s shoulder, and so great was Mandri’s awe that he could not contain himself and he whooped his excitement. Obo—pitiful Obo—had turned away the army of Shis all by himself.

Blasts them out of the sky, beam beam beam
The entire horde was dead.
Head turned towards the door. Low hum, ravaneous horde. Glint of firelight on their backs like a swarm of hornets.
“Um…I don’t have enough in me for all of them.”
Ayramun what that meant.
Elrahet screamed, “Run!”
Mandri slowest.
As he running. Heart exploding in his chest.
“Mandri.”
“What!?”
“Remember what you said about friendship?”
“Obo, what in the white light—”
“I’m going to prove something to you.”
Hops off.
Mandri running away.
Moto, moteah, and Purl cut them with swords. 
Demons ran right past them.
All to Obo.
it clicked. The conversation. He’d said no one. He wasn’t about to let Obo prove him wrong. Grab Obo and not let him do it.
Demons swarm. 
#
Obo was to slow. Beam weaker. Burning himself alive.
Slice.
Cut. 
#
No!
#
As if the sl. Time was slipping, Mandri had the. Frozen. As before, in the Goree Pass. The rainbowed light of purpose.
An urge, again to paint. A glorious scene. Figures in such as only artists could dream, a diorama of flesh, flame, and butchery. Threading through his eye.
He was crying, eyes wide, tears overflowing his lid. Not for his mother. Not for himself. He cried for Obo.
#
#
She pushes, tries to move. Hard as a statue.
“Incredible.”
She sways and moves and effortlessly glides. Admires Mandri.
#
“I didn’t think it’d happen so soon. I’ve been waiting for a thousand years, and here you are.”
Mandri did not dare to speak but his muscles the scene and if he were to speak the tension break.
“Tongue tied? Do I frighten you? I’m the mother of demons—who wouldn’t be scared of me?”
“Speak, Mandrameen. This is your moment.” 
“What is happening?”
“I can’t tell you. You can only be shown. You have to show yourself.”
#
She pulls out a the black stone canvas and paints.
#
“You want me to paint?”
#
“That is what you were made for. That is why you are here. Why else would you have come to very doorstep of Shis? You will paint a self-portrait—the first true self-portrait you’ve ever painting..”
#
“But what is happening?”
#
“You have to move beyond that Mandri. Your mind is rooted in causes and effects, but none of these are real. You believe that you are Mandrameen, but that, too, is an illusion. Mandri was born, he will die, while your real being knows neither beginning, nor end.”
Mandri flick to Obo.
“I can see I’m not making myself clear. Speech is too blunt a tool. If you begin to paint, I’m sure, you’ll come to understand.”
“No.”
“No?”
“I’m not going to do that.”
Remembering what happened last time.
Disappointment.
#
“Mandri, you are going to do it. Why else would you be here?”
Upset confusion into a Beatific smile.
“Remember Mandrameen the portrait painter? He knew what everyone looked like, except for himself. Isn’t that right? A true self-portrait is impossible because you don’t truly know your own face, even if you have a mirror—you can turn your head in every direction, but your eyes are always looking straight into themselves. You can look around and study your features, but you’ll never capture that look of looking away. That’s how the mirror nurtures the illusion of the self—you’re always looking straight into your own eyes and you begin to think that that is you. But you’ve never seen what you look like when you’re sleeping. You’ll never see what you look like when you’re dead. Everyone else’s eyes will shutter, but you’re own—you’ve never seen it happen, so who’s to say they’ll ever close? Do you blink, Mandri? Do you notice yourself blinking? Don’t blink now, or you might ruin it.
#
Mandri realized he hadn’t yet blinked since. His eyes were stuck in the trance.
#
“Do you sleep? What happens to Mandrameen when you sleep? Where does he go?”
“I’ve never thought about it.”
Sigh. 
“At least you’re honest. That’s more than I can say for most people.” 
Wistful look at Elrahet, Moto.
“Look at them. They can’t see any of this. Look at how frightened they are of dying. You see, all they’ll lose is the stories they create of themselves. They invent themselves just to torment themselves.”
Look to Obo.
“The Mazid too. What an ironic creature—spent its short life searching for freedom and finds it, but in so doing he’s become an enslaver of the Spark.”
“How do you know that?”
“I’ll talk about him as I wish. You know it because Schisol told you?”
“I do.”
Mandri throws the rock.
“Ack!”
Stare at Mandri. Burst into an absolute fit of laughter.
“Do you think you just proved me wrong!? You do, don’t you?”
“You’re so full of shit.
“Oh, my dear Mandri. How can you not see you’re the gaburshegee, the infertile ground, you deny everyone else’s plans for you, even mine. No one in the world can tell you what to do. But there’s one more person you have to reject.”
“Schisol?”
“Yourself. You see through everyone else’s manipulations, you need only to take it one step further.”
“And what if I don’t want to?”
“What you want is irrelevant.”
“Are you going to force me to paint a picture?”
“I cannot. You must pick up the brush on your own accord. When you’re ready. As you can see, we have all the time in the world.”
He’d heard enough. Sees Obo’s spark interest.
“Your Spark seeks another. This is what it wants.”
“You can be in union with it. This pain you feel, it is not necessary.”
Sees Obo. Tearjerk. Injustice. Wasteful. Meaning.
“I thought it was only Solraheen who’d make a sacrifice like this.”
“Solraheen a sacrifice!? You don’t actually believe that story, do you? You’re smarter than that, Mandri.”
Confusion.
“It was Schisol who called down the Fabled Black, not Solraheen. Schisol knew what would happen if the people were left to govern their own affairs. Given enough time, their selfishness, loneliness, and desperation would only strengthen in the absence of a god. Schisol trapped Himself to keep Solraheen from interfering with my work. And soon, when I am finished, and have united all the Spark, it is Schisol who will make the ultimate sacrifice—for dying is no great sacrifice, no, Schisol will live, He’ll live for all eternity alone, weeping, just to protect against the chance of His brother rising up and starting it all over again.”
#
“Where are you going?”
“To test a theory.”
Brings the Spark along, dragging the light of purpose along with him. Steps to the edge of the abyss.
“What are you doing?” Pell asked, her voice on as much of an edge as Mandri’s toes.
Mandri answered her by dropping Obo’s Spark. It fell into the Abyss, shining bright like a distant star, until finally, it disappeared all together, dragging a of million threads down with it.
He blinked.
Time restarted and the . As cleared, there was Pell, fuming. She shrieked a , “You’ll be back!” she shrieked. “It is FATED!”. Her final word echoed through the cavernous void, and then she split into smoke. 
Mandri turned, and there was the Ayramun, 
“What happened?” Purl asked.
“Let’s go,” he replied. Brushed passed Moto who shouted, “Boy!”
Mandri turned and said defiantly, “My name is Mandri.”
Moto , sorry about it, before asking calmly, “What happened?” 
“Obo sacrificed himself for you.”
“The Mazid?”
“His name was Obo.”
Kept on walking.
“Mandri!” Elrahet. “Can you see the threads of purpose?”
“Yes. Not right now. But I could. Can you?”
Nod.
“You can see them right now?”
“I can.”
“And where do they lead?”
#
#
Let me make clear. From now on, I am no longer Elrahet. I am Elrah. You are now the Elrahun. Leave me on pain of death. Betray me on pain of a tortured life. 
Sneer at them all.
Do you submit?
Purl kneeled. Moteah did as well. Moto, s to a woman but at a glare from his sister, he kneeled. 
Mandri . He would kneel for no one. He’d turned one old witch down.
Seeing Mandri still standing, Moto, and he stood back up. Ashamed and embarrassed that he’d ever 
Moteah pulled him back down.
Elrah said to Mandri, You will the Sand on your own, and you will die.
Your aid didn’t seem to help the rest of the Ayramun.
Insult.
#
The rest of the Elrahun followed.
#
Mandri has God’s Eye in his robe.
#
//“Where are you going?” asked Moteah.
He paused and said, “I’m going to free Solraheen.”
Mandri, though he did not know the way. 
//

Looking into Obo’s open chest, there was purl’s hand.

Tobs rocks - light of purpose - wondering what to do - picks one up - thread of purpose whistled up and arc to Pell’s forehead. He threw it. Expected it to kill her. Plunked on the floor
“Ack!”

            <Title>Elrahet's Story</Title>
            <Text>The God’s Eye burgeon weighed heavily in Mandri’s pocket. It was there and it was always there. And he couldn’t think about anything else. Perhaps the witch was the cause of his fixation. The God’s Eye sight had revealed a world tied together by threads of purpose, and it had shown how Elrahet could cut these threads that bound him to everything else.
He was tethered now only to Obo.
And perhaps the burgeon, too.
He wouldn’t mind being untethered to everything else, but that should be his choice, not anyone else’s. Waste away on a farm outside of Meskalim? That was his choice. This was too much. Elrahet had simply done what she wanted to do, like she was some well-adjusted person. Like Moto.
Elrahet was another thing he couldn’t stop thinking about. What he’d seen of Elrahet, under the influence of the God’s Eye burgeon, was indescribable. More than even Ayram, she was shrouded in blinding purpose.
As Mandri walked he began to suspect that his inability to think about anything else was due to the act of walking itself. Something about forward locomotion prevented lateral thinking. It explained why outland pokes seemed dumber than everyone else—too much walking. But it didn’t explain why he could talk about anything while walking, and talking was much the same as thinking. And it didn’t explain Obo, who wasn’t walking, and yet he was thinking about all the same things. When he shifted around around in his litter and asked a question, well of course, it was about Elrahet.
“What do you make of the witch?” he asked.
The question left Mandri speechless, and Obo asked again, “I said what do you make of the witch?”
“How did you know I was thinking about her?”
“I didn’t.”
Mandri doubted it. Obo was too attuned to Mandri’s moods for it to be mere coincidence.
Mandri said, “The witch is…she’s…do you know what I saw?”
“You mentioned it only briefly.”
“I saw white threads. Like spider threads, only they shimmered with brilliant color.”
“You said the witch could see them too?”
“She could see them and cut them. Each time she did, I changed. I can’t explain it, but… I think she was changing the future.”
“Isn’t that what we’re all trying to do?”
“Sure, but I mean, she could see the future, and change it.”
“I think we should ask the Ayramun about it.”
“What!? No. Absolutely not.”
“Mandri, something is going on which is clearly much deeper than what is going on.”
“Yeah, but that doesn’t mean we have to—”
“Let’s ask Moto.”
“Let’s not.”
Obo shouted, “Hey, Moto!” 
Moto was walking not ten yards in front. “What do you want?” he called back without turning to look.
Mandri whispered, “Obo, don’t,” but Obo ignored him, and called out again, “Could you come here, please?”
“What do you want?”
“We want to know what kind of witch Elrahet is.”
Moto suddenly stopped, and when he turned around, he did so slowly, deliberately, as if he’d been waiting for days to be asked this very question. “Who’s asking?” he asked. “You or Mandri?”
Mandri said, “Both of us.”
Moto looked over his shoulder towards Elrahet, who was some distance ahead, trailing Ayram. He cupped his voice and called out, “El!”
The old witch turned in her tracks and stared back. Her face was lost in the shadow of her cowl.
“The boy wants to know!” he called.
The old witch drew an arc in the air with her walking cane, then continued on marching.
 Moto said, “That means she’ll tell you at night’s rest.” He turned back to the trail.
The much anticipated night rest came quickly. Mandri helped build the fire, though his role was reduced to gathering fuel, as ‘maker of the fire’ was Moto’s role, a role reserved for men. True men. Not Mandri. Evidently, Mandri wasn’t strong enough to rub sticks together. But when the fire was finished, Mandri was allowed to sit as close to the fire as he could, and Obo slid out of his litter to join him. When everyone had gathered, Moto reminded Elrahet of her promise to tell her story.
“Ask again, and I won’t tell it,” Elrahet warned as she warmed her bony knees by the fire. Moteah passed around a bag of jerked beef. Moto was gracious enough to share a skin of beer—an unprecedented courtesy which led Mandri to wonder if this was a final meal. He took a nervous sip as the night settled in. The starry sky was bright. The air was pleasant. The soft hiss of the wind sprinkled sand. There was scuffle nearby as a squeaking desert rat met its end in the jaws of something or other, probably a lizard. At this point, Mandri wondered if Elrahet had died with her eyes stuck open. Then she grumbled, “Where to begin? It is likely that the boy’s mind is too polluted to understand.” She paused and stared at the campfire’s slender flicks of flame.
“I will begin at the beginning. More might have come before the beginning, but who can say? Solraheen emerged into the Void, and it was Solraheen, the Spark, and the Void. Nothing else. How did these three come to be? None can say. No, not even the Solitants.” She looked at Mandri as she envenomed the name of that religious order. Mandri pinched off a corner of a slip of salty beef. Elrahet watched him. He felt she was waiting for him to defend the dictates of the Solitants, and so he did.
“But the Solitants say that Solraheen came from the Spark when the Spark was pierced by—”
“Take or leave my story, boy, but first it must be given.”
“She means, shut up,” said Moto.
Mandri shrugged. “Solraheen had to come from somewhere.” Everyone stared at him like he was an idiot. Everyone but Ayram. Ayram was half asleep. So Mandri said, “Sorry,” and he poked his pinch of beef into his cheek to show that he was done interrupting.
“There was Solraheen, the Spark, and the Void,” Elrahet said, re-centering her story. “There were no days back then, there were no years to measure the passing of the age. It was an eternity. Solraheen spent this time alone. A hundred million thousand years alone. When He’d had enough, He uttered the first word, and the sound of the word shattered the Spark. From the Spark’s fragments, Solraheen created a garden world. He fashioned land and sea for His enjoyment. He created all manner of creatures for His companionship. It was beautiful, yet beauty loses its charm when it stays the same, for that was what He created—Stasis. Order. Every day the same. Each new day was indistinguishable from the day before, and so His garden did not give Him pleasure. The dullness reminded him of the very thing He’d tried to escape, it reminded Him of that timeless eon shared with the Void and the Spark.
“In His boundless wisdom, He brought forth a new creation, one in which living creatures no longer merely lived, but they brought forth offspring. There were many generations, all of them different from their forebears. And He gave these living things brighter Sparks than they’d had before, such Sparks as we possess. In so doing, He condemned the living things to die, for the heat of their Sparks slowly burned and killed them. That is the purpose of death—it is the plow which turns creation over anew and gives the seedlings room to grow.
“You might judge Solraheen for condemning all living things to death, but know that death comes for the sake of a deeper, flowing beauty, beauty such as Solraheen Himself never dreamed of. And He Himself would abide by death’s principles, for He truly believed that His creation must be free of His influence, that it might grow up to define itself on its own terms. Any proud and loving parent would die that their children might live to reach beyond them, so, Solraheen laid down to die, and die He did.”
This was a heresy Mandri had never heard. He blurted out, “Solraheen killed Himself? That’s not how He died.”
Moteah smacked him on the back of his head. “Shut up!”
Mandri fished for sympathy with a pouty look, but even Obo was annoyed with his interruptions. Mandri shrank back, and Elrahet continued on.
“Solraheen laid down to die—but!—He did not fully die. Against His will, His body awakened, possessed by a different mind. This mind was none other than the mind of Schisol.”
This was a telling that went too far. There were acceptably familiar elements, yes, but the old woman’s words were baited with blasphemous knowledge. Especially tantalizing was the suggestion that Solraheen and Schisol were of the same flesh.
“Schisol awoke inhabiting Solraheen’s body knowing nothing—no knowledge of the world or even of Himself, or even of Solraheen who came before. He wandered His brother’s garden as confused as any of us. As the ages passed, Schisol’s mind matured. He felt the heat of Sparked creatures and grew sorry for them. He saw how their every breath was invisible flame, how their bodies were burning, slowly, until death. He saw their endless cycle of loneliness and pain, and He came to believe that creation was a corruption. He correctly assumed that all Sparks had been shattered from a single all-white Spark, and from this He devised a cure—loneliness and death would disappear if all Sparks were to be reunited together again in sacred communion. So, Schisol set about destroying the garden, killing all the living creatures and joining their Sparks together. It took Him a long millennia, but in the end He prevailed. The last thing to join with this all-white Spark was Himself. And so, He killed Himself, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, this time, in the possession of Solraheen.
“Solraheen awoke into the Void accompanied by the single all-white Spark. He had no memory of what had occurred while Schisol was in control of Their body. He had no memory of Schisol. He knew only that He laid down to die amongst a beautiful world and had awakened into a Void. He was confused. Seeing no other to blame for the death of His garden world, He blamed Himself, and though His grief was immeasurable, He began His creative work once more. But this time He selected a number from amongst the creatures which roamed the world and invested them with Mind, so that they could, in His absence, act as stewards of creation. These were the first humans, and they wandered the land and sailed the seas and fulfilled their duty admirably, living peaceably with each other. Solraheen was once again satisfied, and as before, He laid down to die so that His creation could come into its own. But instead of dying, His body rose again.”
“Schisol,” Moto muttered in child-like wonder.
Elrahet nodded.
“Schisol awoke into His worst nightmare, for He saw that the all-white Spark had once again been split and fragmented. Another miserable garden had blossomed, trapping all the Spark’s splinters into a never-ending cycle of suffering and despair. Amongst the lonely creatures that roamed this garden were the saddest, loneliest, most terrifying creatures imaginable—humans. 
“Schisol set out to destroy creation for a second time. To hasten this end, He explained to humanity their suffering, how it was caused by the splitting of the Spark, and He enlisted their aid in destroying the rest of creation that it might be made whole. But some humans remembered their stewardship and the teachings of Solraheen. They remembered creation’s beauty. They resisted. Schisol inflicted tortures upon them, but this pain only transformed them into beings of tremendous power—these were the first of the lesser gods. They arrayed themselves against Schisol and His minions. A cataclysmic battle took place. All the lesser gods were killed, yet Schisol, too, was slain. But He was not completely dead. His body arose again, possessed by Solraheen.
“Solraheen awoke into a land laid waste by war. He asked the struggling humans what had occurred, but He did not understand their stories, for he did not understand His own dual nature. The people claimed that He Himself had   ordered the slaughter. While some men and women were eager to fulfill this dark command, there were those who had resisted. From amongst these righteous people, Solraheen selected a girl, one whom He trusted, and He made her His Envoy that she might preach and cleanse the garden of all corruption. Solraheen made her immortal, that she might maintain a thread of purity in His eventual absence, and together, they set out to regenerate the world. But Schisol’s minions, believing that their god had betrayed them, conspired to end Him. They summoned the first Amalgamete. This creature gave birth to the foulest of demons, a dark assassin with venom spun from shadows. Solraheen was murdered, but He did not die, He arose again as Schisol.
“It was then that the truth of Their dual nature was revealed, for Solraheen’s Envoy ran to Him, thinking, of course, that she was running to Solraheen. When Schisol learned that His twin Self was responsible for creating the garden, for creating this world of suffering, His rage was boundless…those were dark days. When Schisol regained Himself, He came to believe that if He could send a message to His brother, He could make Solraheen see fit to end the senseless suffering. But as Schisol did not trust Solraheen’s Envoy to do the message justice, He raised up another young woman for Himself and gave her eternal life. He called her his Shadow, and with her, He shared His foul message, and then He ended Himself, that Solraheen might arise and learn the truth.
“But Schisol’s message was ill received by Solraheen. As you might guess, Schisol’s Envoy rallied Schisol’s minions, and they murdered Solraheen, and thereafter came a cycling which lasted another long eternity. When the evil Schisol lived, Solraheen’s blessed were martyred and their purified Sparks transformed into gods who joined together to undo Schisol’s terror. When Solraheen lived, Schisol’s minions raised armies of demons to undo Him. In a desperate attempt to finish this endless struggle, Solraheen called down a piece of the Void, what your people call Fabled Black, and it fell from the sky as a meteor and obliterated Solraheen. He did this so as to prevent Schisol from ever rising again.”
“But the fight isn’t over,” said Moto, pointing out the obvious.
“Yes,” said Elrahet. “We made a mistake. The battle still rages, for Schisol’s Shadow still lives.”
“So does Solraheen’s Envoy,” Moto smirked.
“She does?” Mandri asked, and he was about to add, ‘Who?’, when he noticed that all eyes, including Ayram’s, were fixed on Elrahet.
Mandri wanted to deny it, for no one could be so special, and if they were, they wouldn’t be breathing the same air as him. But he’d seen Elrahet in the sight of The God’s Eye burgeon. If she was immortal, if she was Solraheen’s chosen, well that had explanatory power—that fantastic raiment of light which she wore could only be explained as an accumulation of purpose as the ages wound themselves around her.
And the story explained Pel, that evil witch. She must be Schisol’s Shadow. What else could these two witchy sisters with golden knives be but priestesses for the twin brother gods.
Dead gods.
This meant Elrahet and Pel were the closest things to divinity walking the world.
Them, and the Amalgamete.
If it were true.</Text>

            <Title>Salt Farm</Title>
            <Text>Two years ago, Mandri sold what little he owned and bought a farm ten miles outside of Meskalim. Gil, he’d rescued from a leech farm. The poor old ox was sunk in withers deep swamp water and tied to a frame. The ropes kept him still while leeches fed on him. Two wooden bars set under his legs to kept him standing or else he’d have collapsed into the swamp from pain and exhaustion.
Mandri and Gil tried growing burgeon bushes, but the land was not good for it. It wasn’t good for anything, because when Mandri bought the place the dirt was already worn out. Mandri didn’t know that at the time because he didn’t know anything about farming. The first few plantings were fine, but after that, any time a strong rain came it sucked the salt up out of the ground and it all pooled on the surface, so that eventually his field looked like a sweaty brown salt-stained tunic that had been left to dry out in the sun.
The only thing that would grow was a solitary hornscrub tree. It grew right smack-dab in the middle of the field. The tree’s shade was the only place to laze the days away, and lazing there meant Mandri and Gil would have to look upon the dead earth and scattered stalks of failure. 
It was no matter, though.
Peace of mind could be bought for the price of a burgeon.
A whole bushel could buy bliss.
Mandri found that if he mixed the burgeon’s juice into a milky-white barley beer that he’d left steeping in a hole in the ground, well, two mouthfuls of that and every worry melted away. 
He took one mouthful because he wanted to ease into it. There was no need to rush—it was a beautiful sunny day. There was even a breeze, and the sound of a cool breeze sifting through the boughs of his hornscrub tree was pleasing.
A breeze like that, it’s not something that can be captured by a painting.
Then again, nothing can be captured by a painting..
Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed.
The problem was always the same—an artist rips beauty out of the world and stitches its hide to a frame. Then, after having captured and killed the sublime, they sell it.
But its all a delusion. Nothing inside Nature can be pulled out from the whole. Every painting is a fantasy.
Mandri burped, and took another swig of his burgeon beer.
It was hard for him to not think about painting.
Painting was such a cruel thing to do to Nature.
Paint an oasis, and in so doing he’d be forced to reduce a palm leaf to a fleck of green. The beauty of a living leaf—its complexity, its pattern, its anastomosing veins pumped full of vital fluids, its birth and death and eventual decay, the role it plays on the branch, the branch on the tree, the system within a system, a whole universe unto itself nested inside a greater one—all that complexity, that beauty, reduced to a fleck of green.
Reduced, because the artist has something more important he wants you to look at. There’s a naked woman bathing in the mossy water. There’s no need to properly render the leaf. In fact, rendering that leaf, giving it light and shadow and form, that would only distract the eye from the droplets of jade gleaming on her cinnamon skin. The sensible thing to do, if he had to paint the leaf, was to slightly feather its edge into the sky so that eye doesn’t get caught on a hard line of verdant green set against a chalky blue. He might remove the leaf and the tree altogether if the thing doesn’t slide a wandering eye down towards the temptress’ bosom. And then he’d really done it, he’d not only reduced the leaf down to a daub of color, he’d erased it from existence entirely.
Maybe someone could say that he wasn’t trying to paint Nature, he was trying to paint a woman, and so of course he wouldn’t capture Nature’s essence, but that hardly matters.
“Go and try and paint all this,” Mandri said to Gil as his ox napped the noon away. “Take as long as you like. Take a lifetime. Take ten lifetimes! Then… and then…”
And then he forgot what he was on about because the hairs on Gil’s hide were starting to swirl.
But they only swirled a little bit.
A more intense, boiling swirl was something that only happened when Mandri took black-eye burgeons, and only then if he picked them fresh and got to their juice before it was ever exposed to the moisture sapping air. Down-valley burgeon beer, the kind which he was drinking, does something entirely different. Things will swirl, edges will bleed, but the chief effect was that anything bright would sparkle—Gil’s stubby white horns, the sunlight on the dusty earth, the puffs of cloud in the sky, pretty much everything that wasn’t hidden in shadow would sparkle. Most interestingly, the burgeonsight made it look like the salt stain on his field was squirming around. That was always a delight because it made Mandri feel like he hadn’t lost a battle to an inanimate thing. The salt was alive. It was a flood of wriggling white mites gnawing at the few decaying plants.
At least he’d managed to feed something.
He nestled deeper into the tree trunk’s embrace, and he sighed a little half-sipped, absent sigh, the kind of sigh that he’d start to make whenever he was ready for a nap. He let his eyelids slouch as he watched the flies buzz in and out of Gil’s snout. The ox would snore and blow those fuzzy black dots out of his great big nostrils, and then those flies would zip back in to lick at the only reliable source of moisture that they could find in this godforsaken field.
“Are you Mandrameen?”
Burgeon beer had never given Mandri an extra inner voice before. Odd that it should sound like an old hag. It was an unwelcome development. He did not want to pursue it.  He wanted to sleep.
“Go away,” he said.
But it didn’t go away. It kicked him in the shin.
“Ow!”
The pain pricked Mandri’s mind back into the moment. He opened his eyes and was stunned to see an old woman wrapped in white standing before him. She sparkled tremendously in the dappled light of the hornscrub boughs swaying above her.
Mandri had heard of burgeonsight granting visions, but it had never happened to him. He tried to blink the old woman away, but she was a stubborn vision. He picked up a little pebble and threw it at her. 
It hit her square on the nose.
“Ack!”
She wasn’t ready for it. Her arms flew up in a billow of sparkling white, and she staggered back a step.
She was real.
Mandri’s first instinct was to drink as much of his jumped-up beer as he could, because no doubt this hag would try to steal it.
Then again, she might not know what it was. It looked like milk. And it would be a waste to drink it all in one go—it would knock him out, and what was the point of that? No, that wouldn’t do. This was a special drink. He’d made plenty of special drinks, but this one was extra special because it was right here, a thing of the present. He could maybe try to hide it, tuck the clay jug away somewhere, maybe just nudge it behind the tree, but no doubt that harpy’s eyes were—
“Something wrong with you, boy?” 
The woman’s voice was dire, and there was a nasty squint in the shadow of her shawl as well as a nose that was impossible to reason with. She wasn’t too old, just sun-leathered, and dammit she was tall. Too tall for an old woman. That was man’s air she was breathing.
“I’ll ask again, are you Mandrameen?”
She must be strong too, because her back bore a large canvas sack that nearly doubled her size. And she hadn’t come adorned with the usual veneer of civilization—no shine-black bracelets, or bangles, or silver hoop earrings, no makeup or red-thread leaves trimming her robe. The only ornament she carried was a turtle-shell comb that she kept fashionably crooked in her waistband. The rest of her tawny self seemed slapped together in a reed hut on the banks of the Jek river. Her robes were white, yes, but stained brown and black all over. She was a feral thing, dirty with perfect teeth, all of those teeth were perfectly straight and sun-bleached. The burgeonsight made them sparkle. They practically outshone the sun.
She kicked his shin again.
“Ow!” Mandri moaned. “Dammit, yes, I’m Mandri.”
“Do you still have your testicles?” 
Her teeth flashed as she spoke. Her head pitched into a suspecting tilt. “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
Mandri shook his head in disbelief.
“Just because I don’t go in for the haggard women of Meskalim, that doesn’t make me a—what are you on about anyways?”
“Answer my question.”
“Of course I have my—hold on, who are you?”
“You have your testicles,?”
“Yes.”
“You’re not lying?”
“Did Lora send you?”
The woman unshouldered her heavy pack. It hit the ground with a dull thump, and this disturbed Gil, who raised his heavy head. The ox saw the woman, gave a snort, then promptly went back to sleep. 
Without asking if Mandri minded, the woman sat down upon her pack. She sat down right in front of his feet. Then she pulled from her ragged robe a brown paper booklet. This booklet had no cover, and its makeshift spine was composed of peeling wax and fraying twine.
She laid the booklet flat on her lap and flipped through a few pages. There weren’t many of them. Mandri craned his neck to see if he could read what was there, but the burgeonsight made that impossible. Edges were starting to bleed together.
“So, you are Mandrameen,” the woman said as she flattened an unruly page with her palm.
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. This time he was more demanding.
“I am Pel,” she said.
“Go away, Pel.”
Pel smirked. “I’m going to ask a few questions, and then I’ll be on my way.”
Mandri took another swig of beer. By the looks of her, Pel didn’t have any money, so if it was about money, she was here to take it. If that little book of hers was a book of debts, well, Mandri would not be able to pay up.
“Where are you from, Pel?”
“I come from that which everything comes—the all-white Spark.”
“Oh, you’re one of those.”
“And what is that?”
“An itinerant priest.”
“Priestess,” Pel corrected. “My god is—”
“The gods are all dead,” said Mandri, interrupting.
“Not my god. My god lives through the Hrkan Lords.”
“So I’ve heard.”
Pel gave a bemused sigh and flipped through her pages. “You’re drooling,” she said disdainfully. 
Mandri wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Burgeons can make a mess of a person, but he wasn’t so far gone yet. A peculiar thing about this particular brew was that it left his wits untouched. Well, mostly untouched. Maybe a little touched. Toddler touched. Honestly, Mandri wasn’t sure. He knew it wasn’t safe to reason about reason when burgeons were involved.
He said, “I’ve never seen a priest without a pound of gold or silver rattling around his neck.”
“Me and mine are struggling at the moment.”
“Then your Lord must not be a very strong Lord. Which is he? Lord Gagan?”
Pel ignored Mandri’s question and exclaimed, “Ah! here you are. Mandrameen Andramawmun. That is your full name?” She underlined his name with her finger.
Mandri nodded.
“You have a good name,” Pel said. “A strong Jandri name. An Old Jandri name. That’s good. And my notes say you started learning how to paint at the age of five. Is that right?”
Mandri’s eyes narrowed. If this woman was looking for an artist for some backwater temple icon, she’d come to the wrong place. Unless she had money.
“Do you have money?” he asked.
Pel either didn’t hear him, or pretended not to. She kept on reading from her book.
“My scribblings say you were a decent painter.”
She looked up to gauge Mandri’s reaction. This was some kind of challenge. He was determined to never indulge her. Though, high as he was, his face might be doing things all its own. That’s another thing about burgeons—it numbs the face but sometimes the muscles keep moving. He could be making kissy lips at her right now and he wouldn’t know it unless he focused.
“It says you have a…” Pel bent down to get a better look at the words. “It says you’ve a triptych hanging in the garden of Zee.”
Mandri nodded. 
“It is hanging inside the garden?”
“Yes.”
“You couldn’t make it into the house?”
Mandri blanched at the insinuation. “You’re a right old hag, aren’t you? You know what? You can leave. I don’t care if you’ve brought money, I’m not going to paint anything for you.”
“I’m not here to commission you.”
Mandri wilted.
“Well, whatever you’re here for, I don’t want it. Leave.”
Pel reached into her robe and pulled out a full silver string of little round coins. They sparkled magnificently.
“You’re in want of money?” she asked.
Mandri’s face must have been doing somersaults because the old woman looked almost frightened of him.
She said, “I will pay you to answer questions.”
“Questions about what?”
“Have you ever heard the word ‘gaburshegee’?”
“I’ve heard of burshegee.”
“Would you consider yourself to be ‘fertile ground’ or ‘infertile ground’?”
“Hold on, I’ve already answered one question.” 
He held out his hand like a beggar.
Pel untied the silver string. She unthreaded a shining disc and tossed it. Despite Mandri’s inebriated state, he snatched the coin out of the air. It was strangely light in his hand, an unfamiliar mint, and he couldn’t parse any of the identifying marks for the burgeonsight blurred it all underneath a smattering of sparkles. It wasn’t a Hrkan coin, anyways.
He said, “What’s this all about, anyways? You’re looking for a eunuch? They’re all in Jeket, aren’t they?”
“I am come in the service of Lord Salavan. As you may or may not be aware, his Lordship lacks a Mazid. To find one, we must first find the right person into which the Lord can invest his will.”
“That person is a eunuch?”
“There are many interpretations for the word gaburshegee, and whenever interpretations overlap in the same person, it makes it all the more likely that they are a true gaburshegee. It can mean ‘infertile ground’, ‘empty vessel’, or  simply, ‘eunuch’. It can also mean ‘impotent artist’. And here you are. I would say that a failed painter who tends a fruitless farm might qualify. Wouldn’t you agree?”
Mandri held out his hand again and said, “Pay in advance.”
“Curb your greed,” Pel said flatly. “I’ve plenty more questions to ask.”
She flipped to another page in her book. Then she flipped right back to where she’d been. 
“I might be skipping things I shouldn’t. Let me make sure…” She fingered a scribble, then read it aloud. “Have you ever prayed to Solraheen?”
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Answer the question, please. Have you ever prayed to the dead god Solraheen?”
“Of course I have, who hasn’t?”
Mandri held out his hand again.
Pel waved it away and said, “But have you spoken the words yourself? I’m not talking about being a part of a prayer circle as a child, where someone else does the heavy lifting. Have you ever run away to a quiet place and whispered words to Solraheen?”
“Who hasn’t?”
“Have you?”
Mandri tried to remember how many questions that made.
“One question at a time,” he said.
Pel cocked her eye, frowned, and scribbled something into her book.
“What’s that you’re writing there?”
Pel looked at him with a sinister eye.
“Can you read?” she asked.
“Of course I can read.”
“Then what does this say?”
She held the book open towards Mandri. The pages were blank.
“It doesn’t say anything.”
Pel tossed three more coins at him, and then she scribbled another secret nothing into her book.
“How many burgeons have you eaten?” she asked.
Mandri held out his greedy hand.
She said, “I’m not paying for that question.”
“I haven’t eaten any burgeons.”
“So you’re a liar?”
“I am not.”
“Hah! You should see your eyes. But that’s good. It’s good.” She jotted down another note. “You’re fitting the mold, Mandrameen. Does that excite you?”
“Are you going to pay for that question?”
“Boy, if the prospect of becoming one of the Mazidai does not excite you, then you’ve a dim Spark indeed.”
She flicked a coin into his lap.
“How do you feel about power over all, eternal life, and infinite pleasure?”
“I’ll take the pleasure,” said Mandri. “Leave the others.”
“Have you ever killed someone before?”
“No.”
“How do you feel about killing people?”
“What has that to do with any of this?”
A flash of annoyance cinched Pel’s weathered features. She tossed another coin into Mandri’s lap, then repeated her question.
“How do you feel about killing people?”
Mandri didn’t want to answer, but suspected it was the only way to get this old hag to leave. “Killing someone…well, it depends, doesn’t it? The morality of something like that, it depends. Am I killing in self-defense? Are these, I don’t know, are they murderers?”
“You think that killing someone is a question of morality?”
“Isn’t it?”
“Let me rephrase—How do you feel about people?”
“How do I feel about people?”
The old woman’s squint was getting severe. She asked, “You wouldn’t mind if everyone dropped dead?”
“Did I say that?”
“Stop answering my questions with questions.”
“Look, everybody should be judged on their own merits…what’s the point of this, anyways? You want me to kill someone?” 
“That is what the Mazidai do. They kill people.”
“Yes, I know, but—”
“Remember that people are dying all the time. Right this very moment, they are dying. I don’t mean one or two; hundreds, perhaps a thousand people are dying right now. It is the Lord’s duty to make sure that everyone is dying for a purpose.”
“And you need me?”
“Someone like you.”
“Not me?”
“It might be you.”
“Find someone else.”
Pel laughed. Hers was a grating laugh—half cackle, half delirious groan. “That is not how this works,” she said as she sat back on her bag and cherished Mandri’s simplicity. “I don’t pick someone to play the part. If you are fit for divine purpose, then that is that.”
With that, she closed her book and tucked it back into her robes. She then stood up, and Mandri, thinking she was about to leave, whispered a chime of praise.
“Oh, you’re coming too,” Pel said. “You’ve answered well…or poorly depending upon your view… I’m going to have to take you into Meskalim and see Lord Salavan.”
“I’m not going,” Mandri said as he snuggled back into his tree-crook. He tried to spy what Pel was thinking, but couldn’t, because the woman’s face was a cauldron brewing witchy weirdness. All those aged lines in her face were set to churning by the burgeonsight. But there was something more to it. She was staring at him too intensely. He was being beheld. Lovers do that, but so do murderers. Mandri didn’t want to be remembered by anyone, least of all by this woman.
“What keeps you here?” Pel asked. “You have nothing.” When Mandri didn’t answer, she guessed, “Is it the ox?” 
She stepped towards Gil and gave him a pat. Gil was awake now. His fat, bulging eyes were staring blankly off into the horizon.
“No,” said Mandri simply.
“Then you won’t mind if I make a meal of him.”
“What?” said Mandri as he startled to. He bruised his hip a little on a root, but he pushed through it to declare, “Gil’s not for eating.”
“You named the beast, Gil?”
“I did.”
Gil mooed in recognition.
Pel jingled her silver string, prompting Mandri to add, “And he’s not for sale either.”
Pel grimaced and tucked the silver back into her robe. In the same motion, she drew a long, golden knife from an unseen sheathe. The sudden sight of this thin, curved blade was startling, and the old woman reached down to Gil’s neck before Mandri’s limbs had even stretched.
“What are you doing!?” Mandri said in alarm. “Let him be.”
“All things die, dear Mandri. It’s near enough this ox’s time.”
With her free hand, Pel lifted Gil’s head, and she scraped her knife’s razor edge up and down against Gil’s throat. The poor beast, eager to get in a good scratch, closed his eyes and lifted his chin up higher to make sure Pel could scratch the whole length of it.
Mandri said, “If you put one scratch on him, I’m going to break your jaw on my knee.”
“You’d kill me to save your ox?”
“Without hesitation.”
Pel lowered her blade. “That’s not good,” she said. “That is a mark against you. If you are to be the Mazid, then you will need to be free of such attachments. Better that it happens sooner rather than later.”
With uncanny speed she cupped Gil’s snout under her arm and reached around his neck with her knife. She plunged her blade into the ox’s flesh, driving it tight up against his jaw, then abruptly yanked it round to the other side.
Gil let out a powerful bellow, deep and pitching, and his whole bulk lurched backwards, pulling his head from Pel’s grasp. Gil s bucked as he stood up on his knobbly knees, knocking Pel on her ass, and then he bolted off into the dusty field, bleeding and bleating as he went.  
Mandri, frozen by the sudden burst of violence, watched on in horror as Gill came to a stop just ten yards away, blood pouring into the earth, as if he’d realized he had nowhere to go. He looked back at Mandri and Pel, confused at the betrayal, and Mandri snapped—he picked up a rock, snarled, and leaped after the old hag who sat watching with glee.
One sharp elbow into the uglies sent Mandri sprawling to the ground.
“So, you’re not a eunuch,” Pel said with an awful sneer.
Mandri muttered a curse. He got to his knees and reached out to grab Pel’s robe, but the cloth seemed to melt between his fingers.
Then Pel jumped to her feet as if lifted by an unseen wind.
And then Mandri saw something he couldn’t believe.
Pel flew. She flew straight like an arrow towards the dying ox. To Mandri’s burgeon-addled eyes she was nothing but a scowling head and billowing robe, and he saw, for the briefest moment, her brown eyes alight with bestial rage. The sound of her shriek was borne not from her lungs, but from the deepest depths of Shis.
She plunged head first into Gil’s body, tearing a hole into his belly as easily as if her nose were made of chipped obsidian. Gil crumpled to the ground, and Pel went with him, her head and shoulders fixed into his side.
Before Gil’s spine had the chance to spasm, Pel tore herself from his flesh with the neck of his first stomach clenched between her teeth. She spat it out, then ripped the rest of the innards from their lining and hugged the largest stomach up to the sun. Then her lips began to utter a speech as black as night. 
Mandri clasped his ears, but he could not look away. He prepared himself for some final gross barbarity. Instead, Pel’s chanting squeezed a bright point of light from Gil’s stomach, and she sipped it into her chest through pursed lips, as one might sip a too-hot tea.
Satiated, she dropped Gill’s innards onto the dirt. The tension in her shoulders disappeared.
Next thing Mandri knew, she was standing above him. Her face was a withered sponge of blood, which the burgeonsight swirled into an even more terrifying horror.
“Time to see Lord Salavan,” she growled. “You can bring your burgeon beer.”</Text>

            <Text>A full day passed before the howl of the storm subsided. When it was gone, Ayram entered the ladder room and used his chisel-head spear to poke at the ceiling, hoping to knock loose material to open a way out. The first stab of his spear saw a tumble of bricks fall to the ground, and the second sent a stream of sand pouring into the room. It poured for a worrying while, filling the room with a mound of sand that reached as high as Ayram’s waist, and Mandri’s eyes. A short debate followed over whether to keep poking. Moto feared flooding the entire tunnel system with sand. Ayram ended the argument by stabbing again, and this encouraged a further collapse of stone, and suddenly the dark gave way to a flash of glorious late-morning light.
Then Ayram gathered Moteah by the hips and flung her up through the hole. She managed, somehow, to secure a rope, and she dropped it down behind her. Mandri was one of the last to climb out, and when he did, he was surprised to find himself kneeling at the bottom of a crater of sand. He crawled up to the crater’s rim, where Moteah faced east towards the storm and reckoned its track. It was obvious that the storm was swerving north-to-northeast, and that meant the best path forward was towards the Goree Pass. 
But they would have to move quickly. Who knew what the Hrkan hordes were up to?
Seb was already marching out into the inestimable distance. That sandstorm, now darkening the waste in front of her, was the most incredible power Mandri had ever experienced while sober. When he started walking, he was humming old pilgrims tunes about the desert’s beauty. He hummed for about half-a-hand, then the Sand got to him. The sun was up, the heat was rising, and the wind was blowing, and as it is in the Sand, when the wind blows, the sand accumulates. Sand attracted sand, which attracted more sand. It snuck into his shoes, shimmied under his nails, it choked, and stifled, and narrowed the world. And that’s how it was for the vast majority of the journey towards the Goree pass, so Mandri kept his head down and plodded through it. But it was a long journey, and as the Sand knew Mandri was a stranger, it was intent on providing a bit of show-and-tell.</Text>

            <Title>Godsight</Title>
            <Text>The first floor of the blackstone Western Tower was composed of a single dark hallway running north to south. In the middle of this hall, on either side, were two sets of wide-wood double doors that opened up into large, dust-strewn storage rooms with empty floors. At the end of the hall was a spiraling staircase.
The second floor of the tower was a single enormous room which wrapped around a central pillar. There were two narrow windows in this room, one which looked west, towards the corpse-strewn courtyard and the Goree Pass, and the other looked east, out towards the desert and the Hrkan line. This desert view was obstructed by the rim-lit silhouettes of the Ayramun as they jostled with each other to get a better look at the Hrkan horse and rider.
Ayram and  Elrahet were somewhere out there, ready to meet the fate they’d bought with the lives of their companions.
Mandri watched all this from his seat on the staircase. When he was sure no one would notice, he ducked down into the dark of the first floor to dab one meager droplet of juice from the God’s Eye burgeon onto his tongue—no more than that. The idea was to escape himself, not end up catatonic like before. He then plugged the tiny hole he’d made in the burgeon with a rolled up sliver of woolen rag, and he stuffed the blessed burgeon into the pocket of his sleeve to save for later. If he rationed it carefully, he reasoned, he could make the juice last for a week. The rest he’d roll flat and dry out, and from there he’d experiment to discover the best method of ingestion. He wouldn’t rule anything out. Then, he would steal another.
He sat down on the fourth stair-step and waited there in the dark for the burgeonsight to take hold. He knew it wouldn’t take long.
“Where’s Mandri?” Purl asked from above.
Mandri hid his disappointment well when he said, “I’m down here!”
He didn’t want his absence noted, lest Seb put two and two together, so he climbed back up stairs to join the others.
Purl was the only one who wasn’t glued to the western window. She was sitting against the curving wall, still strapped into her pack. 
“Don’t take it off,” she said to Mandri when she noticed him starting to unshoulder his own burden. 
“Why not?”
“We need to be ready to run.”
“It only takes a second to put it on.”
“Leave it on,” said Purl, demanding.
“Fine.” 
Mandri plopped himself down right next to Purl, pack and all. He leaned into her and said, “Do you have any idea how we’re supposed to get out of this?”
“Ayram has a plan,” she said flatly, as if she didn’t believe it either.
“Didn’t seem like it to me. His words, if I recall, were, ‘I’ll figure it out’.”
“When he says that it’s because he knows we won’t like the plan.”
“I see.”
“Why are you sweating?”
“I’m stressed. And my pack is heavy.”
“But it’s cold in here.”
“Yeah, well, I don’t know.”
He wasn’t about to admit that he’d just swallowed a single milky tear of a God’s Eye burgeon, and it was making his heart skip beats. Strangely, it wasn’t doing anything for his vision.
Purl saw him sigh and asked, “Are you that worried about the Mazid?”
“You mean Obo?”
“The first time I saw that Mazid, I watched it kill thirty Ayramun.”
“Wasn’t that the fault of his Minder?”
“He still should have apologized. At least, he shouldn’t be a prick about it.”
“I think there’s only so much you can expect from a Sparkless Mazid. They’re deceitful…prideful…irritating.”
“And ugly,” said Purl.
Mandri sank back into his pack, which was quite comfy to lean into with all the new additions. “Somehow, it’s all part of Obo’s charm. Like, somehow, if you take all those things together they all cancel each other out and it’s not so bad. Or maybe it’s just that everybody hates him and that’s why I’m drawn to him. It’s like, I mean…I don’t know…we get along.”
That droplet from the God’s Eye burgeon wasn’t doing anything to lighten his mood. It wasn’t expanding the ceiling into infinity, it wasn’t swirling the colors of the floor. It certainly wasn’t tamping down on the feeling of guilt that was stirring way down in his stomach. His legs were heating up.
He considered spritzing his tongue with some more of that burgeon juice, then decided against it. He should be bearing witness to Obo’s final waking moments—and they were his final moments, because even if this little gambit succeeded, there was no way the Ayramun were going to make it all the way to Jeket, much less free Solraheen. If he didn’t walk to that tower window and watch, then the memory of Obo’s passing would be the sole property of people who didn’t care.
Mandri shuffled his legs underneath him into a frog-like squat, and he leaned forward so that the great bulk of his pack was centered on his hips, and then he stood right up.
“Going to watch?” Purl asked.
“Might as well.”
 There wasn’t room enough for him at the window, between all those excited elbows. Then Moto decided that he was needed down below, so he left, and Mandri was able to squeeze himself into the picture before Seb and Moteah could close ranks.
He peered out over the sprawl of back shattered rocks leading out into the bright red desert, and after a moment of admiring the glow of day, and wondering when the God’s Burgeon would arrive, he blinked, and a rainbow light flashed across his vision.
He gasped and shut his eyes, but closed, his sight was flooded by that rainbow light, and it churned, and churned against his lids, forcing his eyes back open. Now his vision was a burst of color, pulsing through the spectrum—first red, into orange, and on, and on, and when this faded, the world was not the same as it was before.
What he saw was akin to burgeonsight, only far greater, for more than glistening surfaces he saw the fibrous iridescent light of unveiled purpose shining out from under the skin of every surface. This white-yet-spectrumed light was swimming under the sand, churning in the tower’s shadow, breathing out the tower itself. Tufted strands sparkled up out of the black stone of the window-sill underneath Mandri’s fingers—every element here and was bristling with the flighty colored fibers of purpose, and these fibers took flight and were hereby joined in Mandrameen’s eye, for his sight was the spindle that bound them together into a thread that wound back out through his widened iris and into the world, a yarn spun tight, a continuous threading and rethreading of purpose.
Threads of scintillating spectrumed light swirled out of the stomachs of the figures below—there winding out of Ayram and Elrahet, out of the horse, out of its blue-robed rider and black-robed Riga child.
Mandri caught his breath and realized time itself had stopped. The figures below were stuck in dynamic, limb-bent postures, seemingly fixed by the brilliant thread into a pyramidal frame—Ayram and Elrahet anchored bottom corners, the scribe on his white horse towered into a point. This was true purpose here, and where the purpose was strongest, the threads burned white. They keeling into the scribe, for he did not represent Hrkan power advantaged on a proud steed, he was that power, and in his lap was the Riga child, the very embodiment of Hrk’s assault on the sanctity of creation. White threads swirled around Ayram, who was not a symbol of the outland peoples, he was their paragon. Glowing brightest were all those threads connected to Elrahet, who was herself the very essence of the Sand given agency. Lying on the ground, woven into the middle of this divine tapestry, was Mazidobo, a creature constructed for the sole purpose of setting the affairs of humanity in order, and look where he was, destitute in the dirt, scarred and cowering and naked. The others looked past him as if he weren’t there at all.
Mandri lamented the lack of materials. If he’d only had a stick of charcoal and a board he could start sketching then and there. The urge to do so was overwhelming, for the scene was pleading with him to be given its own sacred body, a painting in a frame, an object to which the iridescent threads of the moment’s purpose could move about the world and inject their meaning into every future moment.
If he didn’t sketch it out now as he saw it, details would be forgotten. After one night’s sleep they'd be lost forever.
He was forced instead to imprint the scene upon his mind as best he could. He kept his eye jumping from detail to detail and back again, and then back again, and again, and again, and at each stop he beheld the object—an act beyond mere noticing. This was the artist's noticing, the lover's noticing, covetous noticing, jealous noticing, noticing to remember. Beholding not a lossless art, but what gets lost has chance of being reconstructed later.
He ran through the details again like a common sundry list.
The arc of the tower’s shadow splitting the scene in half. 
The coolness of color inside that shadow and its subtle, sumptuous grays, almost blue.
The size disparity between Ayram and Elrahet—both dark and shrouded in that tower’s shadow. 
The wind flicked hem of Elrahet’s desert-bitten robe.
The Hrkan horse, a splendid white horse—white as chalk. It’s brushed muscles glistened in the light of the sun. It’s neck was as wide as Ayram’s shoulders. It’s richly braided half-flicked in anxiousness.
Sitting in the brown saddle was the Hrkan scribe. His dark skin was reddened and glistening with kell oil. The trail of his blue robe was filigreed with golden leaves. His right arm cradled the black-bundled Riga with care. 
Obo on the ground. Pale. Fly-swatted. Staring at the sky. So perfect was the staging that the warm spectral edge of the tower's penumbra cut right across his stomach. 
The rest of the world—the black tower bricks, the mush of shattered rock and sand—these were static things and could be ignored because they could be revisited later. It was an injustice, abstracting them out as if they weren't bound by the bristling with purpose, but Mandri knew it was more than he could manage.
He ran through the details again, though his eyelids were feeling heavy. He noticed that in all this time he hadn’t blinked.
He shouldn’t blink.
He should keep them open.
Notice the arc of the tower’s shadow—that hadn't changed.
Ayram and Elrahet still stood resolute.
The horse hadn’t even shifted it’s weight. It’d been standing on two feet this whole time. Wonderful. 
He licked his lips. His mouth was dry. Burgeons have a way of doing that.
A new detail—the white line of Hrkan soldiers hanging in the distance. It would take a large canvas to accommodate them, and a lot of paint. He twinged at the thought having to fill up so large a frame.
Should he include the light of purpose? How to paint it?
He would have to worry about that later. The details need accounting.
A new detail—Ayram’s spear—how had he missed it? The dark tip of that spear formed an unsightly tangent with the horse’s leather stirrup, such that the stirrup and accompanying harness seemed to sprout out from the spear’s haft. This element would need to be fixed. It flattened the image. Mandri could adjust the angle of the bar in Ayram’s hand so that it needn’t intersect with the stirrup at all.
Would it be sacrilegious to alter this image in any way?
Was the angle of the spear part of the purpose?
Did he miss anything?
Yes, there was a vulture up in the sky. Mandri wished it wasn’t there, because a vulture circling the scene was too on the nose. People might start to think that this was all his own doing. Maybe he should remove the vulture.
No, that would be a step too far. 
He would have to include the vulture.
A new detail—sound. And now that he noticed it, all the sounds of the scene were coming at him in one long exhale. The faint scream of the vulture. The wind whistling over the mountains. The sparkling swish of whipping sand. A shrill whistle.
A whistle?
The Riga’s whistle.
He blinked, and suddenly the scene smashed into him. He shut his eyes and yelped, for the Riga’s shrill split into his head . He opened his eyes again just in time to see Obo’s gray Spark zipping out of his body and into the Riga’s mouth. Then Ayram roared, charged, and stabbed at the scribe with his spear. The scribe’s horse whinnied in fright, and reared as its rider was skewered up under his ribs.
“Mandri!”
The call had come from behind him.
He spun around and was surprised to find that Moteah and Seb were no longer squeezing against his shoulders, in fact, they weren’t even in the room. Gone, too, was the iridescent light of purpose that flooded his vision—there was only the stark, cold interior of the tower’s second level, deserted save for Purl who stood waist deep in the stairwell across the room. Her face was alight with wide-eyed urgency. “Come on!” she shouted, and then she ducked away down the stairs.
Mandri blinked in confusion.
He spun back around to the window so that he could narrate for Purl the magnificence of the scene below, but Ayram was already running back towards the tower, with Elrahet’s head popping out of the top of his backpack. Obo, and the Riga were gone. The Hrkan scribe lay flat on his stomach, face down into a thickening pool of his own blood. His frightened steed was charging hard into the emptiness of open desert. The Hrkan soldiers beyond had spread themselves out into a long white line—a net of swords marching towards the tower in double time. 
“Well, shit,” Mandri muttered.
Fear gripped him. He ran as fast as could towards the stairs, but each step was a chore for his limbs were thick with the lethargy left by the passing of the God’s Eye sight.
He staggered down the stairs and into the darkness of the first floor hallway. Here, the true bewilderment set in and his stomach turned. His throat made to vomit—his chest heaved three violent times, but the only thing to come of this wrenching were stray strings of spittle. He thanked Solraheen for the closeness of the cold stone walls, else he might not have managed to stumble out into the tower’s gateway tunnel.
“What are you doing!?” Purl shouted.
She had been waiting for him in the courtyard with the pilgrims.
“Hurry up!” she shouted.
Mandri followed her and fixed his eyes on the wheel-rutted path, thinking as best he could about his next step instead of the horror of the scene around him. That captivating light of purpose was nowhere to be seen around these poles. They weren’t anywhere. They had well and truly gone.
Mandri shouted, “It was incredible!”
Purl didn’t listen.
He chased her into the shadow of that god-stricken cleft of earth called the Goree Pass.</Text>

Mandri followed Elrahet down into a meandering maze of close-felt darkness. The air was alive the sounds of footfalls and heavy breathing, some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight—no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons just waiting for a chance to strike. Then Elrahet turned a tight corner and passed underneath an unassuming gray stone frame with out so much as a shrug.
This door frame had perfectly plumb and squared columns.
Unfamiliar symbols were scratched into its posts.
Mandri hesitated.
Purl hustled past him with an annoyed shoulder.
Moteah ran right along. She assumed Mandri was too weak to keep up with the pace. “There’s no time for rest,” she said as she disappeared into the dark.
Moto, who’d taken up responsibility for the rear of their little file as they shuffled through the dark, paused before this doorless threshold. It was clear from his worried expression that the language was foreign to him. He muttered a prayer and kept on marching, and when Mandri lost sight of light of the man’s torch, he dared a whisper to Obo, who still sat in his pack.
“Obo,” he said.
“What?”
“What do you know about Shis?”
“There are too many conflicting stories,” Obo said.
Mandri waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock. “Can you read this?”
Obo climbed out of Mandri’s pack to peek over Mandri’s shoulder and get a gander.
“It’s Schisol’s screed,” he said.
“I knew it.”

Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth. 
Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right.
Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.
Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be together.

“We should keep moving, Mandri.”
“Why? They’re casually strolling down into Shis—and why? Because Elrahet said so? She could be leading us to a slaughter.”
The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of symbols. Mandri dared to reach out and touch them, and he found there wasn’t a single speck of dust polluting the grooves. Either they’d been cut yesterday, or someone was washing the rock.
“Mandri,” said Obo, “Whatever’s down here, I’ll handle it.”
Moteah’s voice came bounding out of the dark tunnel ahead.
“MANDRI!”
Obo shouted back, “We’re coming!”, and then he gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder.
Mandri stepped through the gate.
What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone threshold made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with a few thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs and that was it. And this path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. Elrahet and the others were creeping along this treacherous brink, with only a few cutout handholds keeping them from certain death.
Once all the Ayramun had shimmied across, it was Mandri’s turn. He tried to move but his knees were locked in fear. His armpits were practically sweating rain despite the chill that blew up from the fissure.
Mandri looked at the ledge as it flickered in the torchlight. It was barely there.
“Come on,” said Moto from the other side.
Mandri tossed his torch across—he wasn’t about to try this with only one hand. Then he prayed a wordless prayer, stepped up to the abyss, and began to side-shuffle along the ledge. He was halfway across when a sliver of stone broke out from under his leading foot. He swayed out into the darkness, but he was able to pull himself against the rock wall and regained his balance, but he didn’t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the abyss, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up and nearly knocking Mandri loose. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him.
They journeyed on and the rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. The walls were so narrow in places that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways, dragging his Obo laden pack behind like a stubborn dog. Elrahet marched through it all with purpose in her step. She spared no hesitation whenever a decision needed to be made about which dark and foreboding path to take. Mandri had expected this adventure under the earth would resemble their stumbling through the temple Shulgi—butting into dead ends and unremembered rooms, but that never happened. Elrahet had been here before.
She led them into a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill, and this left Mandri’s hands cold and clammy, and he started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself, for his torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable—hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows which he mistook for mere divots gave way to potholes to twist his ankle. And the longer it went on the less and less he cared about even these scrapes and bruises. He wondered if this malaise was a result of nearing to the core of Shis.
He measured out time by measuring the weariness in his legs. The start of soreness in his calves was a sign that it’d been at least four hands. Once the unremitting burn set into his thighs, well that marked at least a half-days journey. It was an accurate system, or so Mandri believed, because every time he reached the edge of giving up Elrahet stopped underneath a hang of rock and they rested, huddled around a small fire of twigs, though they rested only as long as it took for the fire to turn the twigs to ash. After the second rest like this, Mandri’s system of measurement was broke, because when they started out again his legs were already sore. 
 It wasn’t until the fourth march that Mandri’s shoes slapped onto paved floor. This came as a great surprise because the walls were still rough hewn, and his feet were so used to stubbing their toes against unsettling bumps, that finding themselves on a surface as flat as screeded sand challenged their whole sense of reality. It was grey clay tiling, and engraved along the border of each square tile was a jagged chain of thorns. This hall spilled out into a larger one, and this larger hall opened up into a cavern that was so large that its size was impossible to say. The entirety of this cavern floor was paved in those tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps the pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. It was unfamiliar design, like a flower with it’s petals closed, and though Mandri had never seen its like before he knew it was a sign of Schisol. 
The sound of their shuffling feet reverberated out into the emptiness, and they all hunched along as if sneaking. Mandri almost laughed at the sight of his skulking band, because if any nearby demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they’d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches. And they moved like this for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern’s end. They could go no further, for the grey stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a giant stone double-door that would take a team of oxen to open. These imposing doors were to sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures from which Batata had drawn inspiration. But these demons looked much more real when rendered in stone, and instead of whipping stick-figured humans, they were doing unmentionable things to men and women fully fleshed.
Set atop these doors was a stone head in flat relief, bald like Obo’s, and twice as unnerving because it seemed to be licking its lips at sight of Mandri’s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders, and the rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly arms stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door’s bottom hinges.
“Spark a fire,” said Elrahet as she eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn.
Moto unstrapped his pack and pulled out a handful broken twigs.
“More,” said Elrahet. “All of it. We might be waiting here a while.”
Mandri was thankful for the pause, though he wished Elrahet had picked a less conspicuous location. It seemed imprudent to make camp on the very doorstep of Shis, and judging from the nervous looks the others shared, he was not the only one to feel that way.
Moto recruited more wood from the others and set a campfire alight, making sure to keep a healthy distance away from the door. When that was done, he smothered everyone’s torch with the same rag that Obo had used to wipe himself clean of the Amalgamete’s stomach. Mandri, robbed of his own personal comfort flame, sat as close to the fire as he could. Meanwhile, Obo slid out of the litter to go and reflect upon the door.
The Mazyd stilted along on his nubby arms, a swiveling gait, a pitiful sight, yet Obo moved with an air of confidence, and he plopped himself down in before those terrifying doors so that Schisol’s head at the top was staring down right at him.
Obo said aloud, “Are we going to open it?”
“Open the doors of Shis!?” exclaimed Moto. “Are you mad?”
Moteah added, “What do you think you’ll find?”
“That’s why I want to open it,” said Obo as he studied the door’s manic display of torture. “I should very much like to see what all the fuss is about. After all, this is what we’ve come to see, isn’t it?”
All eyes turned to Elrahet, for only she knew what they were doing down here.
Elrahet pulled Moto’s pack aside so that she could sit on it and warm her bony knees by the fire. When she had settled, she said, “Come and sit. I’ve a story to tell that you all need to hear.”
Obo hurried over and sat down in the spot between Mandri and Purl. Moteah passed around a bag of jerked beef, while Moto was gracious enough to share a skin of beer—an unprecedented courtesy which led Mandri to wonder if this were a final meal. He chewed his food nervously as sounds echoed out of the cavern’s starless sky—faint drips water, the soft hiss of wind gusting up through some unseen shaft, the scuffle and shrieking squeak of a rat who’d met his end in the jaws of a silent hunter.
“My story begins at the Beginning,” Elrahet said, “When all existence belonged to a single Spark. Then Solrah came to be. No one knows how She came to be. Somehow, the Spark was pierced and Solrah bled out of it as sap bleeds out of a tree. Memory of Solrah survived through her son, Solraheen, for though Solrah died in childbirth, Solraheen inherited Her mind.
“This was the second age, when all that existed was Solraheen and the Spark. This age was, I believe, the longest of them all, though there were no days, and there were no years—there was no counting of time, and yet, well, it doesn’t matter. In the end, Solraheen grew lonely. He spoke the first word, and this word shattered the Spark, and from these fragments Solraheen created a garden world. He created land and sea for His enjoyment, and He created all manner of creatures for His companionship. He found this to be difficult, for the heat of the Spark withered stone and burned flesh and everything eventually died. But Solraheen was endlessly creative. He invented love, and in so doing he managed to tweak and bend the sacred Spark to defy death, for death was conquered with every new birth. He had created a creation which sustained itself—even created itself. Solraheen was proud, and like a proud parent he believed that His child should be free of His influence to continue on and define itself on its own terms. So he laid down to die, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, possessed by a different mind. This mind was none other than the mind of Schisol.”
Mandri hung tight to every word. This was not a telling he’d heard before. There were familiar elements, yes, but the telling was lured with heresy and forbidden knowledge, especially tantalizing was the suggestion that Solraheen and Schisol were of the same flesh.
“Schisol awoke into Solraheen’s body like a newborn babe—without knowledge of the world or even Himself, or even of Solrah who came before. He wandered His brother’s garden as confused as any of us ever did. As the ages passed His mind matured, and He felt the heat of Sparked creatures and saw how their every breath was a flame, how their bodies were burning, slowly, until death. He saw an endless cycle of loneliness and pain, and he came to believe that creation was a corruption, that all Sparks had been shattered from a single Spark, and that to cure loneliness and death they should be reunited again into an eternally happy whole, in perfect communion with each other. So He set about destroying the garden, killing all creatures and joining their Sparks together. It took Him a long millennia, but in the end He prevailed. The last thing to join together with the whole was Himself, and so He killed Himself, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, this time, in the possession of Solraheen.
“Solraheen awoke once again into a void next to the all-white Spark, and he saw that His creation had been erased. He had no memory of what had occurred while Schisol was in control of the body, and He had no memory of Schisol. He blamed Himself for His garden’s failure. Though His grief was immeasurable, He began His work again. This time He selected a number from amongst the creatures which roamed the earth and into them He invested Mind, so that they could, in His absence, act as stewards of all creation. These were the first humans, and they lived peaceably with each other, and they gave birth to Art, Philosophy, and a wondrous Civilization, so wondrous that Solraheen was once again satisfied again with His garden. As before, He laid down to rest so that His creation could come into its own, but instead of dying, His body rose again.
“Schisol,” Moto muttered in a breath of child-like wonder.
Elrahet nodded.
“Schisol awoke into His worst nightmare, for He saw that the all-white Spark had once again been split, and another miserable garden was blossoming, trapping all the splinters of the Spark into a never-ending cycle of dread and despair. Amongst the lonely creatures that roamed this garden were the saddest, loneliest, most terrifying creatures imaginable—humans. Then one day Schisol saw a man kill himself out of heartbreak, and instead of that man’s Spark being reinvested into the Spark-ensnaring cycle, the man’s Spark was lost forever, dimming the whole should it ever be put back together again. 
“Schisol set out again to destroy all creation. To hasten this end he explained to humanity their suffering, he taught them about the splitting of the Spark, and he enlisted their aid in destroying the rest of creation. But some humans remembered the teachings of Solraheen, they remembered that they did not want to die, and so they resisted. Schisol inflicted tortures upon them, but this pain instead invested them with tremendous power, and they became the lesser gods. These forces arrayed themselves against Schisol and His minions. A cataclysmic battle took place. Schisol Himself was slain. But he was not completely dead, his body arose again, centuries later, and again, Solraheen walked the earth.
“The world He walked was a land laid waste by war. He asked the struggling humans what had occurred, but He did not believe their stories, for some amongst them were liars, still under the sway of Schisol’s corrupted teachings even if they did not know it. Solraheen selected from amongst them a girl, one whom he trusted, and he gave her the gift of immortal life that she might act as His envoy, for He was concerned that if He were to die again, then His garden would become corrupted again. He did what he could to regenerate the world, but Schisol’s minions conspired to end Him. They summoned an Amalgamete, one much greater than Greskal, and this creature gave birth to the foulest of demons and it murdered Solraheen. But again, He did not die, not completely.
“He arose as Schisol, and Solraheen’s immortal envoy ran to Him, thinking, of course, that the He were Solraheen. It was then that the truth Their dual nature was revealed. Schisol learned that He Himself was responsible for all the suffering in this Garden, and His rage was boundless. Those were dark days, but when Schisol regained Himself, He came to believe that if he could communicate with Solraheen, He could convince Him that this garden was a perversion of the Spark, and that Solraheen would agree to put an end to all the senseless suffering. So, Schisol resolved to send a message to His twin brother—but as He did not trust Solraheen’s envoy to do the message justice, Schisol raised up a young woman for Himself and gave her eternal life. With her He shared His corrupted message, and then He ended Himself, that Solraheen might arise and learn the truth.
“Schisol’s envoy tried to convince Solraheen to destroy the world and reunite the Spark, but her message was ill received. Solraheen, in defiance of His brother’s wishes, regenerated the world anew. As you might guess, Schisol’s woman rallied Schisol’s minions, and they murdered Solraheen, and the world has been stuck in a cycling ever since. When Schisol lives, Solraheen’s blessed are martyred and their purified Sparks transform into gods who join together to undo Schisol’s terror. When Solraheen lives, Schisol’s minions raise up armies demons to undo Him. As you well know, we live in the age of Solraheen, but what has been done in this age has been done in no other—in a desperate attempt to end the cycle, Solraheen called down a piece of the void and trapped Himself underneath it, so as to forever forestall Schisol’s return. Even if He were to be killed, Schisol would awaken trapped underneath a mountain of Fabled Black.”
Obo spoke up and said, “I take that it didn’t work, else you wouldn’t need me to try and free Him.”
“Yes, it was a mistake. Solraheen hoped that with the battle over, that love and goodness would thrive and push Skisol’s minions back into their barrows under the earth. But He did not forsee what the Hrkan Lords would do to Him, or how they would twist his message. Without Solraheen’s guidance, Schisol’s creed has spread like weed, and I worry that when the next cycle comes, there won’t be enough righteous men and women to fight it.”
Elrahet stared longingly into the fire and the lines on her face grew deep. The others shared her contemplative stillness, for one cannot speak, or even think, when digesting a story as hers. Mandri chewed on his slip of beef and rummaged around his thoughts for a hint on how to feel about it—he’d heard too many world-explaining stories to be sure that Elrahet told the true, nonetheless, Elrahet had led him straight to the doors of Shis, so if anyone had such knowledge it should be her. A sign or confirmation, when suddenly, out of the darkness around him there arose a voice, a woman’s voice, a voice as old and rumbling as Elrahet’s.
“Welllllcome”, it said in a gnarled, as if it were inviting him to join the dead.
Mandri spun his back to fire and faced the cavernous void. He saw nothing and no one. Then came a grinding sound as stone slid against stone. The great doors of Shis were swiveling in their hinges. They swiveled inward, and they opened up a wide enough slit for a single figure to pass through—an old woman tall and graceful, robed in a single black sheet that draped down to the floor but did not touch, and as the woman moved towards the fire she seemed to float. Mandri recognized her instantly—it was Pell.
It was the demon-witch who’d killed is ox.
It was the dark priestess who’d set this  all into motion.
Both Moto and Moteah sprang up and drew their swords.
“Stay your hand!” Elrahet shouted. “She’s who we’ve come to see.” 
“Have you come to see me,” said Pell she drifted nearer, her long black robe reflecting a velvet sheen. “Or have you come to tell these people lies?”
“I told no lies,” Elrahet growled as she stood up with the help of her cane.
“Oh please,” said Pell, “You’re old enough to know that when you leave out important details, that’s as good as lying.”
Pell came to a halt a few yards away from the fire, careful not to enter the Ayramun’s circle. Moto and Moteah had yet to sheathe their swords.
“You know I could kill you all with a blink,” she said.
Moto’s hand tightened against the leather grip of his sword. Mandri knew swords were no use here, and that Moto, fast as he was, could not outswing the speed of that deceptive witch.
“She’s posturing,” Elrahet said as she made her way around the fire to confront her counterpart. She stood before the much taller witch and stamped her cane defiantly against the floor. “She and we have a truce.”
“We do,” said Pell. “Though I must admit, there’s always that lingering thought, isn’t there, that if I were to kill you one more time, it could be the death that sticks.”
Elrahet’s retort was grumble, to which Pell smiled and said, “If you’ve come to my door to offer yourselves to the slaughter, then I accept.”
“I said we’ve come to see you, and that’s all we’ve come to do. Seeing you is enough.”
Amusement flickered across Pell’s aged face.
“See me? That’s all? I know I’m beautiful, but to make such a journey to merely see me—it’s too flattering.”
“Some among us needed to see your evil for themselves.”
“Oh, I see.”
Pell’s imperious gaze turned to the others gathered around the fire, and especially Obo. She leered at him as a Lord leers at a broken man. 
 She said, “You’ve come to show off your new toy, is that it?”
“The Mazyd is no toy,” said Elrahet. “It’s as Sparked as you and me.”
The news shattered Pell’s smirk into a wrinkling frown. She spat at Obo, then regarded Elrahet anew with fury. “There’s no end to your perversions of the Spark, is there!? Still building abominations.”
“Abomination?” Elrahet snarled. “Speak of abomination, bitch—what of the poles in the Goree Pass?”
The mention of those accursed poles set Pell back at ease. She drew her lips tight and said, “You can hardly blame the demons. They’ve only been waiting five thousand years for these blessed days. That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You can feel it coming, can’t you? Despite all your travails in the Sand, you worry—it’s all been for nothing.”
“You do not see everything,” said Elrahet.
“Neither do you.”
“I see more than you.”
“Oh please, how could that possibly be true when your eyes have never grown accustomed to the dark?”
“We’ve killed your Amalgamete,” said Elrahet.
Pell deflected this triumph away with a wave of her hand. “I wasn’t referring to Greskal.”
Elrahet’s grin curdled into a scowl and Pell reveled in it. She then turned her attention to the Ayramun, savored their unease, and when her eyes finally alighted on Mandri she locked her gaze with his, and for a shuttered instant her true eyes flashed, bright and warm, golden threaded, declaring mystic tidings which Mandri could not being to comprehend—then she blinked and her eyes were dark again, she looked away, leaving Mandri to wonder if the others had caught it too.
“Gentle Sparks,” Pell said aloud, throwing her voice out into the cavern, “Would you please grace us with your presence?”
Her request fell into the black, and a moment later the black began stir. Mandri tried to rub the insanity out of his eyes, but yes, the black itself began to stir, and as it weaved and wound it squelched out growls and grated shrieks, then bright points of light emerged within it like jittering stars, and these stars mounded up, grew brighter, and as they did along came the the pitching laughter of demons—not just two, or three, or twenty, for that horde of stars resolved themselves into a horde of fire reflecting eyes—thousands of blinking eyes in a thousand different configurations—eyes set wide, bovine eyes, mousey eyes, eyes of giants, eight-fold sets of spider eyes swaying overhead, all of them hesitant to enter into the firelight, as if embarrassed of their own grotesquery. 
The first demon Mandri actually saw came ambling in and out of the dimness in a naked knuckle-walking strut. It was vaguely human, with a mouthless face that was scrunched towards the middle, as if its skin was being pulled into its nose. After this frightening sight, another set of glowing eyes stepped forth with confidence into the light, revealing a goat headed demon with black Zosan skin and a chiseled physique, and its feet were hooved as well. This demon was then joined by a circle of its horrid brethren, each leaping out, it seemed, from Mandri’s childhood dreams for there was every manner of mashed-up anatomy between man, insect, and beast. This circle of dread surrounded the Ayramun, a circle broken only by Pell and the doors of Shis behind her.
“You see,” Pell said to Elrahet, “You’ve spent so much time staring at Solraheen that His light has blinded you to what the world is becoming. Now, if you would, please leave, before I begin to forget the practical nature of our truce.”
Elrahet was stuck in shock at the sight of so great an evil—rank upon rank of evil. Her face was so that it seemed she’d just witnessed the very end of days. It was Purl who shook her out of this by saying her name, “Elrahet!”
The old witch snapped to and, 
“We leave!”
Everyone snatched up their packs and lit their torches in the campfire’s flame.
Obo did not move.
“Hold on,” he said to all. He stilted his way towards Pell so that she could see him clearly. He asked her, “These demons here, they want to kill me?”
“Nothing so crude,” said Pell. “They want to recover your Spark and add it to their own.”
One of the demons nearest Obo, a tusked woman with the body of a boar snarled and hissed, spraying Obo with its putrid spittle.
Pell said, “She wishes to put you back where you belong.”
Obo wiped his cheek and replied, “That is not acceptable.”
His blunt response jolted Pell into amazement. Her thin lips grew tight, her brows jumped, and then she burst into a tremendous fit of laughter which was taken up by her demon horde and escalated into terrifying noise that rivaled a peal of thunder.
“Oh, my, my!” she said. “Not acceptable?! My dear Mazyd, we have collected an uncountable number of Sparks throughout the ages—yours will be no different.”
“Of that uncountable number,” said Obo, “How many belonged to Mazyd?”
Pell stooped down to peer at Obo, hands on knees, as if she were lecturing a child.
“We have collected the Sparks of gods. I assure you, yours will be no different.”
“Then it seems a peaceable conclusion is not possible.”
“It never is.”
“Very well.”
Obo, , opened his mouth. A heartbeat later and his throat ran gold and fire poured out in a beam as bright as the sun, smashing through the air where Pell had been for she’d expected this turn, and disappeared into a flash of smoke before the heat could singe her. Obo’s blazing fire to smashed through this swirling cloud and it burned through the left door of Shis—such was its power that pushed through the stone as easily it would push through a slab of skin. Such was the dazzling brilliance of this roaring flame that it surprised even Obo.
“IDIOT!” Elrahet screamed as she swung her cane at Obo’s head. It smacked the Mazyd’s skull hard, but it was the cane that cracked.
“I didn’t know she could do that,” said Obo as he watched the smoke that was once a witch dissipate into nothingness. Mandri hoped for a moment that old witch might have, somehow, been vaporized by Obo’s power, but then her laugh echoed austere throughout the cavern.
“You’ve broken truce,” she said.
“Not me!” Elrahet replied.
But Pell was unforgiving. “You know the rules.”
The sea of demons began to chatter—teeth chatter, giggle chatter, yapping, sucking, squealing chatter—but they were all too timid to pounce. Then the black, goatheaded demon took a step forward, and this seemed to steel their spines.
Moteah, eyes wide in terror at a fish-headed bear giant looming tall above her, screamed, “You’ve doomed us!”
“Relax,” said Obo, “Someone give me a boost.”
Mandri ran to Obo, grabbed the Mazyd’s arm swung him up and onto the shoulder, where Obo, in this heightened state, tried to plead with the horde. “My dear fellows, if you wish to survive, then you will—”
His plea was cut short by the hunting shriek of a bat swooping overhead. This winged beast was the size of a child, with a child’s flat face and enormous funnel ears wrapping round its head to fan-frame its pea-sized eyes. It dropped out of the cavernous night like an arrow, its curved claws splayed and grasped, its round face contorted in anger—or maybe it was agony, for almost as soon as Mandri saw the creature its head was smashed by a roaring burst of mazydfire, a flame so hot it heated the whole head into incandescence and then it popped. The rest of the body burst into flames and hurtled overhead to crash into the crowd of demons behind. 
With the first blow struck, the army of Shis broke loose.
The demons came running, hopping, sliding, striding, galloping towards Mandri and the Ayramun. Their muscles bulged and their scales sparkled, their whiskered snouts and fanged maws hissed, their pointed beaks screamed for oblivion—but Obo’s golden mazydfire screamed back, it lashed out in two great sweeping arcs to cut down a circle around the Ayramun, obliterating the first rank of demons, cutting the confidence out of that goat-headed demon at the waist. Those that scurried underneath Obo’s sweeping flame—the dog, hog, and lizard demons, the beetle demons—these Obo dispatched with incredible precision and blinding speed as more than twenty blaring beams of flame blasted out of his mouth in space of a breath, vaporizing the head of each demented creature on contact, and when the mazydfire was gone their bodies burst whole into flame leaving a ring of sizzling, steaming flesh to serve as stumbling blocks to the rest of the onrushing horde. 
The Ayramun gathered close to Mandri, close to Obo, and they found safety there underneath his sweeping flame. Obo set himself proud on Mandri’s shoulder, and once all were near, his golden fury raged out again, this time spiraling round and round, cutting down hundreds, perhaps thousands, for at each rotation his mazydfire traveled further out, mowing down larger and larger swathes of demons, and as Obo’s golden beam swept through the dark it left in its wake a smattering of little explosions as all who fell combusted. All demons, no matter how large and fierce, fled before the slaughter. It was truly an awesome display of power, and it was sitting atop Mandri’s shoulder, and so great was Mandri’s awe that he could not contain himself and he whooped his excitement. Obo—pitiful Obo—had turned away the army of Shis all by himself.

Blasts them out of the sky, beam beam beam
The entire horde was dead.
Head turned towards the door. Low hum, ravaneous horde. Glint of firelight on their backs like a swarm of hornets.
“Um…I don’t have enough in me for all of them.”
Ayramun what that meant.
Elrahet screamed, “Run!”
Mandri slowest.
As he running. Heart exploding in his chest.
“Mandri.”
“What!?”
“Remember what you said about friendship?”
“Obo, what in the white light—”
“I’m going to prove something to you.”
Hops off.
Mandri running away.
Moto, moteah, and Purl cut them with swords. 
Demons ran right past them.
All to Obo.
it clicked. The conversation. He’d said no one. He wasn’t about to let Obo prove him wrong. Grab Obo and not let him do it.
Demons swarm. 
#
Obo was to slow. Beam weaker. Burning himself alive.
Slice.
Cut. 
#
No!
#
As if the sl. Time was slipping, Mandri had the. Frozen. As before, in the Goree Pass. The rainbowed light of purpose.
An urge, again to paint. A glorious scene. Figures in such as only artists could dream, a diorama of flesh, flame, and butchery. Threading through his eye.
He was crying, eyes wide, tears overflowing his lid. Not for his mother. Not for himself. He cried for Obo.

She pushes, tries to move. Hard as a statue.
“Incredible.”
She sways and moves and effortlessly glides. Admires Mandri.
#
“I didn’t think it’d happen so soon. I’ve been waiting for a thousand years, and here you are.”
Mandri did not dare to speak but his muscles the scene and if he were to speak the tension break.
“Tongue tied? Do I frighten you? I’m the mother of demons—who wouldn’t be scared of me?”
“Speak, Mandrameen. This is your moment.” 
“What is happening?”
“I can’t tell you. You can only be shown. You have to show yourself.”
#
She pulls out a the black stone canvas and paints.
#
“You want me to paint?”
#
“That is what you were made for. That is why you are here. Why else would you have come to very doorstep of Shis? You will paint a self-portrait—the first true self-portrait you’ve ever painting..”
#
“But what is happening?”
#
“You have to move beyond that Mandri. Your mind is rooted in causes and effects, but none of these are real. You believe that you are Mandrameen, but that, too, is an illusion. Mandri was born, he will die, while your real being knows neither beginning, nor end.”
Mandri flick to Obo.
“I can see I’m not making myself clear. Speech is too blunt a tool. If you begin to paint, I’m sure, you’ll come to understand.”
“No.”
“No?”
“I’m not going to do that.”
Remembering what happened last time.
Disappointment.
#
“Mandri, you are going to do it. Why else would you be here?”
Upset confusion into a Beatific smile.
“Remember Mandrameen the portrait painter? He knew what everyone looked like, except for himself. Isn’t that right? A true self-portrait is impossible because you don’t truly know your own face, even if you have a mirror—you can turn your head in every direction, but your eyes are always looking straight into themselves. You can look around and study your features, but you’ll never capture that look of looking away. That’s how the mirror nurtures the illusion of the self—you’re always looking straight into your own eyes and you begin to think that that is you. But you’ve never seen what you look like when you’re sleeping. You’ll never see what you look like when you’re dead. Everyone else’s eyes will shutter, but you’re own—you’ve never seen it happen, so who’s to say they’ll ever close? Do you blink, Mandri? Do you notice yourself blinking? Don’t blink now, or you might ruin it.
#
Mandri realized he hadn’t yet blinked since. His eyes were stuck in the trance.
#
“Do you sleep? What happens to Mandrameen when you sleep? Where does he go?”
“I’ve never thought about it.”
Sigh. 
“At least you’re honest. That’s more than I can say for most people.” 
Wistful look at Elrahet, Moto.
“Look at them. They can’t see any of this. Look at how frightened they are of dying. You see, all they’ll lose is the stories they create of themselves. They invent themselves just to torment themselves.”
Look to Obo.
“The Mazid too. What an ironic creature—spent its short life searching for freedom and finds it, but in so doing he’s become an enslaver of the Spark.”
“How do you know that?”
“I’ll talk about him as I wish. You know it because Schisol told you?”
“I do.”
Mandri throws the rock.
“Ack!”
Stare at Mandri. Burst into an absolute fit of laughter.
“Do you think you just proved me wrong!? You do, don’t you?”
“You’re so full of shit.
“Oh, my dear Mandri. How can you not see you’re the gaburshegee, the infertile ground, you deny everyone else’s plans for you, even mine. No one in the world can tell you what to do. But there’s one more person you have to reject.”
“Schisol?”
“Yourself. You see through everyone else’s manipulations, you need only to take it one step further.”
“And what if I don’t want to?”
“What you want is irrelevant.”
“Are you going to force me to paint a picture?”
“I cannot. You must pick up the brush on your own accord. When you’re ready. As you can see, we have all the time in the world.”
He’d heard enough. Sees Obo’s spark interest.
“Your Spark seeks another. This is what it wants.”
“You can be in union with it. This pain you feel, it is not necessary.”
Sees Obo. Tearjerk. Injustice. Wasteful. Meaning.
“I thought it was only Solraheen who’d make a sacrifice like this.”
“Solraheen a sacrifice!? You don’t actually believe that story, do you? You’re smarter than that, Mandri.”
Confusion.
“It was Schisol who called down the Fabled Black, not Solraheen. Schisol knew what would happen if the people were left to govern their own affairs. Given enough time, their selfishness, loneliness, and desperation would only strengthen in the absence of a god. Schisol trapped Himself to keep Solraheen from interfering with my work. And soon, when I am finished, and have united all the Spark, it is Schisol who will make the ultimate sacrifice—for dying is no great sacrifice, no, Schisol will live, He’ll live for all eternity alone, weeping, just to protect against the chance of His brother rising up and starting it all over again.”
#
“Where are you going?”
“To test a theory.”
Brings the Spark along, dragging the light of purpose along with him. Steps to the edge of the abyss.
“What are you doing?” Pell asked, her voice on as much of an edge as Mandri’s toes.
Mandri answered her by dropping Obo’s Spark. It fell into the Abyss, shining bright like a distant star, until finally, it disappeared all together, dragging a of million threads down with it.
He blinked.
Time restarted and the . As cleared, there was Pell, fuming. She shrieked a , “You’ll be back!” she shrieked. “It is FATED!”. Her final word echoed through the cavernous void, and then she split into smoke. 
Mandri turned, and there was the Ayramun, 
“What happened?” Purl asked.
“Let’s go,” he replied. Brushed passed Moto who shouted, “Boy!”
Mandri turned and said defiantly, “My name is Mandri.”
Moto , sorry about it, before asking calmly, “What happened?” 
“Obo sacrificed himself for you.”
“The Mazid?”
“His name was Obo.”
Kept on walking.
“Mandri!” Elrahet. “Can you see the threads of purpose?”
“Yes. Not right now. But I could. Can you?”
Nod.
“You can see them right now?”
“I can.”
“And where do they lead?”
#
#
Let me make clear. From now on, I am no longer Elrahet. I am Elrah. You are now the Elrahun. Leave me on pain of death. Betray me on pain of a tortured life. 
Sneer at them all.
Do you submit?
Purl kneeled. Moteah did as well. Moto, s to a woman but at a glare from his sister, he kneeled. 
Mandri . He would kneel for no one. He’d turned one old witch down.
Seeing Mandri still standing, Moto, and he stood back up. Ashamed and embarrassed that he’d ever 
Moteah pulled him back down.
Elrah said to Mandri, You will the Sand on your own, and you will die.
Your aid didn’t seem to help the rest of the Ayramun.
Insult.
#
The rest of the Elrahun followed.
#
Mandri has God’s Eye in his robe.
#
//“Where are you going?” asked Moteah.
He paused and said, “I’m going to free Solraheen.”
Mandri, though he did not know the way.

Looking into Obo’s open chest, there was purl’s hand.

Tobs rocks - light of purpose - wondering what to do - picks one up - thread of purpose whistled up and arc to Pell’s forehead. He threw it. Expected it to kill her. Plunked on the floor
“Ack!”

            <Text>He’d go on to argue that providence is always there, well, almost always there—there are some exceptions. But nevermind those. Thinking about the exceptions didn’t help to see the divine plan. What did help was living in the present, and the key to living in the present is found by getting rid of all expectations. 

Seb once stumbled upon a bald, aching, stiff-jointed pilgrim who claimed that if you don’t have righteous eyes then the next best thing to have is nothing at all. The pilgrim claimed to be able to sit perfectly still and chant his mind into such a trance that his body required no food or water, nor even air, and more importantly, he said that his thoughts were free from expectations.
Seb tried to induce this meditative state in himself, but he couldn’t do it. He doubted the old pilgrim could either, at least not for any meaningful length of time. Sitting still and simply existing is what a rock does, and people aren’t rocks. People look at things, and when they look, they try to understand, and when they try to understand, the expectations inevitably come. But if that’s true, then how does one get to living in the present if expectations are inevitable?
The easiest thing to do would be to kill himself and be reunified with the All-White Spark. But he could only try that once. Until that day came, Seb figured that the best thing to do was to err on the side of the woman traveler in that nine-line story and expect as little as possible. At least she had some appreciation for divine mysteries.
Seb reasoned that having no expectations and expecting to not have anything were close enough to the same thing, and close enough usually got him what he wanted. If he put a lie on a hook he’d eventually pull up the truth, and maybe if he baited his hook with the crumb of an expectation, he’d pull up no expectations at all. This might not make any sense, but that didn’t matter, because sense was for people who were expecting sense. Seb was a creature of the present, a man who knew how to wait for the future, and he knew how to keep his expectations low while doing it. In fact,

            <Synopsis>!</Synopsis>
            <Text>Mandri stretched out his legs in a futile attempt to recover from the rigor of death. He wanted to stand up and walk around, but he was forced by circumstance to sit and wait in the bottom of the Ayramun’s limestone pit. He watched the sun as it crossed over to noon, such that its light shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. By then, most of the Ayramun had retreated into the tunnel. Forty stayed to keep watch over Mandri, and Mandri stayed because he thought he was supposed to. But he preferred the warmth. He set his back against the rock and shut his eyes, and he had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd of brown ragged pokes came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, away from Mandri, chattering excitedly like children. 
Mandri watched them blather, tried to pick up some hints about what was going on, then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention.
Out of the shadowed tunnel came Ayram.
Mandri had never seen a man so big.
He’d seen giants in paintings, but those were paintings. Those giants were Hrkan Lords painted to be twice their actual size, an unreality meant to lift up ordinary rulers in the eyes of their subjects. It was a genre known as ‘the conquering hero’, and it was a tired genre, a joke even amongst the Lords who knew they were ordinary men. And Mandri agreed. He’d never once spared an admiring thought for these men. The first thought that came to Mandri’s mind when he saw Ayram was, ‘Oh, shit,’ and the second was the more considered, ‘This must be Arnaggu’.
Arnaggu was the first Hrkan Lord, a true conquering hero, the inspiration for the genre. In some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towered above the windswept Forni plain. It was a terrifying piece. The relief itself sat four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicted stretched all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image was a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen dressed in the garb of slaves—naked torsos and skirted hips. Their limbs are splayed out like flattened lizards. Their faces are fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu’s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is depicted ten times larger than any other, and he stood at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage. His upper torso and head were the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seemed to be tearing himself out of the rock, eyes wild but brow untroubled, the look of royal rage, as if he’d just heard whispers of rebellion and was dead-set on cutting out the treacherous tongues with his blade.
Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen, and at first blush a prickling sense of awe stippled his skin. To contend with Arnaggu was to contend with the entirety of the rock.
Ayram looked like Arnaggu reborn, a true giant, with a stern countenance seemingly carved from stone. His hair was wrapped up in a black headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, black, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet Unkileen, who was himself named after a mountain. Ayram wasn’t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens. And the way he moved, with his too-long legs wrapped in faded black wool and swinging in a loping gait, he seemed possessed of that skinny-legged power that hides inside a horse.
Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, the man carried the body of a conquered wretch under his arm. This was none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo, whose bald head was twisted the right way around. Obo’s silver eyes blinked in the sun, and set against Ayram’s bronzed skin and black robes, his naked, chalk-white flesh was gleaming.
Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him. All of them stared at their master’s capture like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for a greasy hand to divvy up the meal. The awkward nakedness of Obo’s body drew hearty jeers. Weeg was quick to point out that this Mazid didn’t have an asshole.
“No wonder he acts like his shit don’t stink,” he said, smirking.
“It do when it come out the mouth,” said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.
“Bet it does!” Tob roared. He then slapped his knee and killed the joke by hitting it square in the face. “Shit comes out its mouth because it's full of shit!”
His belly-rumbling laugh was followed by a storm of obscenities that rained down upon poor Obo—almost all the Ayramun joined in. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.
Obo bore their insults with the bearing of a bullied child who’d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo stood up and smiled, almost gloating, and this triggered a roar of fury and renewed calls for the Obo’s head on a spike.
Ayram settled his people down with a shrill and sharp two-fingered whistle. 
He then turned to the cave from which he’d come and he shouted, “Elrahet!”.
His voice was deep and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous chest, and already echoed before they’d even left his lips, giving the unsettling impression that two men spoke at once..
An old woman’s voice came grumbling back from the cave.
“Sol’s light, I’m coming.”
A witch came hobbling out of the dark, clouded in a mass of ruffled black tatters, and leaning on a thigh-high cane of withered driftwood. She kept her shawled head downcast in deference, and with her spine as bowed as it was, she was no taller than Ayram’s hip.
She joined the Ayramun’s circle, completing it. As soon as she was settled, Ayram worked his piercing gaze upon the rest of his people, and eventually his eyes landed on Mandri.
“And you,” he said, “Come here.”
Forty pushed Mandri up, and whispered, “Go on.”
Mandri scuffled across the sand, passed a smirking Obo, and he stood before the giant, suddenly aware that everyone’s eyes were on him.
“What’s your name, boy?”
“Mandri.”
“Look at me, Mandri.”
Mandri looked up and tried to find Ayram’s eyes against a backdrop of blue-bright sky.
“You been crying, boy? ”
Mandri shook his head.
“Why are your eyes red and witless, puffy?”
The old witch stepped forward, steadied herself on her gnarled cane and said, “His body has not yet recovered from death. His face is still stuffed with blood.” The shadow of her cowl hid a sneering squint that folded so much age around her eyes that the eyes themselves were little more than black seeds thumb-pressed into her sockets. And those seeds were moving, they flitted underneath those wrinkles, studying the outline of Mandri’s figure as if they could see the smell of death exuding out from him. Eventually they fixed on his wounded arm.
“How is it?” she asked flatly.
Mandri raised his poulticed wrist. The sight of it alone was sickening, for the once-white linen was stained brown and black, and tufts of rotted vegetative matter sprouted out between the gaps in the slap-dash wrapping, and oozing out alongside was a dark, unsightly ooze.
“I don’t feel a thing,” Mandri muttered as he turned it over, marveling at the incongruity between sight and feeling. Indeed, he felt nothing at all, not only an absence of pain, but an absence of anger, too—these bandits had cut off his hand and he didn’t much care, though that probably had something to do with Ayram’s intimidating presence.
“That’s good,” said Ayram.
“It’s bad,” the witch corrected. “He must feel the hand to work it.”
“It’s no matter,” said Ayram, inflecting his words with encouragement as he set his own great hand upon Mandri’s shoulder. He then turned Mandri around to face Obo and the rest of the Ayramun.
“I want you to command it,” he said. “You have been made this Mazid’s Minder. Command it to kneel to me. If you command it to do anything other than kneel, I’m going to crush your spine.”
Ayram’s hand shifted to the back of Mandri’s neck. The calloused weight of it swallowed Mandri’s own soft and sinewy self, and when Ayram gave a slight, yet terrifying squeeze, Mandri nearly yelped.
“So, I just…tell him to kneel?”
“Yes.”
Mandri had seen a Minder only once before, and that was a fleeting glimpse. He’d never seen a Minder voice a command. His own word was never enough to compel anyone to do anything, so why it should work now was a mystery. 
“Tell the creature to kneel,” Ayram urged.
Obo’s pale skin was blinding in the brightness of noon-day sun. Mandri stared, and like some god-touched idiot he tried to summon some guiding sensation which might uncover some hidden instinct, if indeed he had been endowed with such a thing, but all he felt was the weight of Ayram’s hand on the back of his neck. 
He took a deep breath, steadied himself, and hoping to get it over with, he issued a soft but direct, “Kneel.” It was a command, but a pleading one, almost apologetic. While that was the only kind of command that Mandri respected, it did not have the desired effect. Obo did not move. Instead, he cocked his ear and asked, “Could you say that again? I didn’t quite catch your meaning.”
Mandri risked an over-the-shoulder glance at the giant who towered up behind him. All he could see of Ayram’s head from this angle was that bread-loaf beard, as well as a sharp nose poking out.
Mandri muttered, “It seems he doesn’t want to kneel.”
Ayram squeezed Mandri neck again and bellowed, “That was no command. Puff out your chest! Say it with conviction. Think of yourself as a fat Junkite Queen hungry for meat.”
Before Mandri could do any of this, the witch Elrahet ambled into view. Her knees slapped the black tatters of her robe, sending the robe’s ragged hem swinging to and fro. Her eyes still fretted over Mandri’s figure. She stood before him, between him and Obo, and she waved Ayram away with a flick of her knobby fingers. The giant grunted but obeyed.
Then she began to circle Mandri as a vulture circles its meal. As she moved she mumbled a guttural speech devoid of natural pauses where she might take a breath, and this flow of mumblings had a stupefying effect, such that Mandri felt his thoughts and feelings leave him. By the second circling he was so far removed from the moment that he almost didn’t see the witch’s right hand plunge into her ragged robes and emerge with a curved, golden knife.
It was a knife he had seen before.
In fact, it looked exactly like the knife that the demon witch Pel had used to slaughter Gil.
“Stare at the Mazid,” Elrahet growled when she noticed him noticing her. “Think of nothing but the Mazid.”
Mandri’s eyes instinctively flicked to Obo, but thinking of him was difficult to do because he had seen Elrahet lick her withered lips at the sight of his stomach. And she was holding that accursed knife. It was in the light of the sun.
“Look at the Mazid!” Elrahet snipped. “Nothing but the Mazid! Nothing but the Mazid.”
She lashed out with her blade faster than Mandri could flinch, and the blade sliced the air right in front of his belly-button. Mandri stiffened, an involuntary jerk, and now it was clear that this witch was ensorcelling him through her speech. He could actually feel Elrahet’s grating words pulling his mind down out of its perch and into a pleasant quietness, where nothing existed but the sight of Obo. It was an effect he had felt before when he’d sipped too much juice from a rotted bushel of black-spotted burgeons, it was a narrowing of the world between Mandri and his object of interest. But the witch was not done. She continued to circle, and every time her mumblings crescendoed into a witchy bark, she’d lash out with her blade and slash the air just above Mandri’s skin—above his arm, his shoulder, right in front of his nose—and each time Mandri felt some part of himself snap, as if every time she cut the air she cut one of his desires, unmooring his mind from the future so that it would drop a little further down into this trance. Soon it seemed that the only functional parts of him were his legs, which kept him standing, and his vision, though that, too, was blurring, as the limestone pit had dissolved into a whitish pucker behind Obo’s unfinished face.
A strange, bald face.
It needed eyebrows.
“Command it to kneel,” Elrahet snarled. “Shout it!”
An urge bubbled up out of Mandri’s gut and he vomited out a shout, “Kneel!”
The word that flew out of his mouth was not his own, or at least it seemed that way to his inner ear. He supposed it was magic, for the word shivered the sand underneath his feet, and a cool air blew up from nowhere and billowed the hem of his robe. And more than that, when the word passed out of his throat it wrenched at the Spark inside his stomach, and he wheezed as his insides twisted, doubling him over in pain.
When he caught his breath he looked up, and Obo was still standing, watching him. The effort seemed to amuse him. “Come now, Mandri,” he said with a relaxed smile. “If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
Ayram’s great hand gripped Mandri’s shoulder again and straightened him out.
“Again.”
Mandri clutched his stomach and nearly fainted.
“Feel for your hand,” Elrahet stressed as she waddled again into view. “You must use your hand. Feel for the pulse in your fingers and squeeze.” She motioned for Mandri to raise his arm and he did, he held that weedy poultice out before him as she began again to circle. He struggled against the witch’s mumblings as they dragged him back down into her thrall. He aimed his handless wrist at the Obo as if it were a weapon, and his mind ricocheted off the monstrous thought that his movements were not his own and he plunged into a vision of his severed hand stuck inside Obo’s chest. His pale, dead fingers were squeezing a malformed slug of muscle that passed for a heart.
“KNEEL!” He screamed, and the concussive word rattled the pit’s chalky walls then rebounded right back at him, shaking his own hardened heart in its cage and speeding into the cave behind, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back out. That this powerful shout had come from him was the least incredible thing, for the air between himself and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if his very shout had somehow thwacked the dusty ground between like an invisible whip.
Obo’s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether, and for a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Mandri’s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. 
“Almost!” said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had stolen all of Mandri’s strength. Mandri wobbled and collapsed to his knees for his insides felt like they had imploded and his handless wrist felt like it was burning.
“Oh,” said Obo, a smirk playing on his lips. “Is that what you wanted me to do?”
Mandri couldn’t breathe. He floundered in the sand, gasping.
Ayram strolled right on by and glowered over pale little Obo.
“Why are you not kneeling?” he asked the Mazid.
Obo stood defiant. “I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
Ayram pointed down at Mandri. “He is your Minder, yes?”
“He is.”
“Then why are you not kneeling?”
“His will is weak,” Obo said as if it were a matter of obvious fact.
Mandri buried his face into the crook of his arm as he cowered against the gawking stares of the Ayramun.
“In truth,” said Obo, “A Minder cannot command a Mazid to do anything. A Minder can only stop me from doing something they don’t want me to do.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then said, “What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which.”
There was another pause, and when Mandri peeked out he saw Obo’s face wrinkled in amusement. Obo said, “If you are unsatisfied, you can always try again, but I tell you, you’ve chosen the wrong man to be Minder.”
Ayram spun around. Mandri cringed, fearing the giant’s boot would come down on him, but Ayram was looking to his witch.
“Why the boy?” he asked.
Elrahet grunted. “You would doubt my judgment, now of all times?”
“I need to know.”
Elrahet grunted again. She shuffled nearer. Mandri thought he could hear her old bones jangling inside her skin. She said, “A Minder’s connection to their Mazid is a leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash to achieve some measure of control. This boy here lacks that training. Everyone here lacks that training. So it is no surprise that with him the leash is long. It will require time and effort on my part to focus him.”
From the way Ayram scrunched his brow, this explanation was just on the verge of being acceptable. “If the boy has no control, then why hasn’t the Mazid burnt us all with its fire?”
“As I’ve said before,” said Elrahet, voice weary and annoyed, “Mazidfire dwells in the Mazid, but it belongs to the Minder and only a strong Minder can wield it. As the boy is not yet strong, the Mazidfire is no danger. But commanding the Mazid to kneel, that he should be able to do.”
“Why can’t he?”
“It may be as the Mazid says—his will is weak. But sure as mudgrass grows in mud, his will shall return to him.”
Ayram gritted his teeth as he chewed on the witch’s words. This did not seem to be an acceptable answer. When he turned his attention to Obo, he said aloud, “Someone toss me a dagger.”
A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram’s feet. Ayram picked it up, and the blade was no bigger than a butterknife when compared to Ayram’s hand. The giant set the blade’s edge up tight against the side of Obo’s neck.
“Kneel,” he said brusquely.
Obo was unmoved. “Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from my new Minder.”
Ayram rotated the dagger so that its sharp point was digging into Obo’s white skin. “If you don’t do what I want, then I have no use for you.”
“Then I suggest you direct your attention towards your choice of Minder.”
Ayram pushed the dagger’s tip into Obo’s flesh, more in curiosity than cruelty. It was a scene reminiscent of some sword-swallower’s trick—the blade was inches deep in Obo’s neck, and while Obo’s whole body was tense his face was completely unconcerned. And when Ayram withdrew the blade, only a few drops of blood trickled out from the wound.
Elrahet stepped forth once again and cleared her throat. “This is unneeded. The boy will control the creature in time. If he is unable, I will find someone who will.” 
“We don’t have time for that!” Ayram exclaimed as he shrugged her away and began to pace back and forth. His left hand clasped his right behind his back, while his right hand twirled the bone-handled blade like a toothpick in between dexterous fingers. It was a grand show of furious thinking, one which went on for far too long, though everyone was keen to indulge it. Eventually, he stopped right before Mandri’s downcast face—Ayram’s leather boots were the same width as Mandri’s own head.
“You are free to speak,” said Ayram.
Mandri lay silent for a respectful moment, then looked up and asked, “What do you want me to say?”
Ayram squatted down so that his great head blocked out the sun. “Were you always soft, or did dying do that to you? It couldn’t have been a bad death as you’re all in once piece.”
Mandri didn’t answer, so Ayram asked, “You ever killed anyone before?”
Mandri shook his head no.
“You ever killed a goat? A pig? Anything bigger than a rat?”
“I was a painter.”
Ayram sighed and stood back up. He said, “Of course you were. Did my people explain to you what this is all about?”
“No.”
Ayram rolled his eyes and chastised his people with disappointed glare. He said to Mandri, “I need you to use that Mazid’s fire to kill a demon. You know what a demon is, don’t you?”
Mandri nodded.
“I don’t speak of some storytime, feather-plucking demon. It is the demon of demons—a beast called the Amalgamete. If you are unwilling or unable to kill it, then I have no use for you. Is that clear?”
The bone-handled blade dripped a drop of blood onto Mandri’s robe.
“I may interject,” said Obo. “I have a potential solution to this little quandary we all find ourselves in.” 
“Do you?” Ayram asked, feigning interest.
“It seems that I have something you want, and you happen to have something that I want.”
“What I want you can’t give.”
“You want my fire to destroy some imagined enemy, and yes, given present circumstances, I cannot control my fire, but if circumstances were to change…”
“Get to the point.”
“How about a bargain?”
A few chuckles rose from the Ayramun, and Mandri thought he knew why—Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his. Ayram stared the Mazid square and said quite bluntly, “I don’t bargain with Hrks.”
“Then don’t call it bargaining,” Obo replied. “We’ll share gestures of goodwill. We can start small, if you like. I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don’t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. Give me a mouthful of water and I will kneel. I will grovel, if you like.”
“How is this going to get me Mazidfire?”
“I guarantee you, I will kill whatever you want if you give me what I want.”
“That so?”
“It is.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the nearby Ayramun and demanded their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram snatched it out of the air, and he unplugged the cork and took a drink. His beard bulged as he swished the water around his mouth, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he wondered aloud, “I didn’t know the Mazidai needed water.”
“We don’t,” Obo answered. “Again, this is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of goodwill.”
“You first,” said Ayram. “Give us a gesture of goodwill, to demonstrate the principle.”
Obo promptly dropped to one knee and bowed his head. And there was no mockery in it—this bend of body and limb was honest, pure obeisance.
“Beautiful,” Ayram mused as he took a moment to appreciate the gesture. “But it goes against my nature to give water to a Hrk.”
He let the statement hang in the air, and when Obo raised his eyes in aggravation, Ayram tossed the waterskin. A chorus of mumbled grumbles sounded out as the waterskin, that sign of goodwill, flew through the air and landed against Obo’s genuflecting knee. Ayram silenced his people’s complaints with a glare, meanwhile Obo simply nodded his thanks and set the skin aside.
“So what will it be, then?” Ayram asked. “What will you take in exchange for hunting a beast?”
“I want my freedom.”
Ayram’s laugh was a bellowing slap—“Hah!”. And when the sound finished ringing around the pit, he said with magnanimous charm, “Kill the Amalgamete, and I’ll let you run into whatever hole you like.”
“No holes,” said Obo. “I wish to be rid of the pseudospark which dwells inside my stomach. I wish to be freed from the Minder’s will which beats my heart. If I had my own bright Spark, then my body and will would be my own. Give this to me, and I would use my fire to kill whoever, or whatever, you wish.”
Ayram’s brow jumped into an incredulous arc. “I’ve been mistaken for a god before, but never Solraheen Himself. You want me to forge a Divine Spark?”
Obo pointed to Mandri. “I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into that boy’s body, so I know it is possible.”
All eyes swiveled to Mandri, who still lay sprawled in the center of the circle. He shrank within his robe against the onslaught of spiteful glares.
“If you could infuse Mandri’s corpse with a Spark, then do the same for me.”
Ayram turned to his scarecrow witch. “Tell the Mazid that it’s impossible.”
Elrahet had been standing perfectly still through all of this, staring at Mandri. Her eyes lingered a pinky finger longer on him, then they flicked away to scour Obo.
“I cleansed the boy’s Spark,” she said gruffly. “I did not breathe him a new one.”
“It can’t be done,” said Ayram firmly.
“I did not say it could not be done,” Elrahet growled as her hand twisted tight on the knobby head of her sand-smoothed cane. To Mandri’s great surprise, she even savored a sneer at her leader. “A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require a sacrifice greater than I can summon. Better to wring the will out of the boy. That, or we find another Minder.”
“Agreed,” said Ayram before turning to Obo and adding, “Even if she could do it, I cannot trust you.” Then he beckoned to his followers and barked, “Moto and Tob! Come hold it flat.”
Big bush Tob stood up. The other man, Moto, was an athletic Zosan. They both hurried over to the kneeling Obo. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand. Tob threw punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. 
“Settle down Tob,” Ayram griped after Tob spat up a chunk of smoke-blacked spit onto Obo’s face. Tob grinned at Ayram’s chiding remark, though he did settle down as Ayram wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar.
This bar was one solid piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head. At its top, the iron splayed out into a chisel, while at the bottom, the iron belled out into a sphere the size of Ayram’s giant fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled the bar once as if it were as light as an oilwood spear.
“If I can’t make you kneel on my own terms,” he said to Obo, “Then you won’t need your legs.”
He marched towards Obo with menace in his step.
“There’s no need for this,” Obo protested, but Ayram was a man who could be moved. He said, “If the Minder can’t mind, then what’s there to stop you from running away when no one’s looking? No. We’ll all be more comfortable this way.”
He raised his spear above Obo’s thigh, and Mandri shut his eyes.
While Mandri could hide from the sight of such a gruesome affair, he could not hide from the sound. When the chisel-head stabbed into Obo’s flesh it snapped the bone.
But Obo did not cry out. Mandri, stunned, sneaked a peek, and there nearby was the Zosan, Moto, steadying Obo’s left hip as he hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons. They repeated this work on Obo’s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.
Through it all, Obo made no sound, and when it was over, and he was legless, Ayram raised his iron bar and shouted, “Someone bag the Mazid up! Bag everything up. It’s time to walk. That damned Amalgamete ain’t coming to us.”
All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled past Mandri and into the darkness of the cave. Forty stopped at Mandri’s side and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked, he glanced back towards Obo, whose blood-stub of a body was a frightful sight laying there in the sand, and just as Mandri’s heart was strafed by the shame of somehow having caused all this, Obo caught his eye, smiled, and gave him another wink, before promptly shutting his eyes for another long spell of pretending to be unconscious.</Text>
            <Notes>I have eyes red and witless elsewhere.

PROBLEM: 
Elrahet is trying to get mandri to tell it to kneel, but minders can’t do that.

Passenger of the moment

Problem:
Obo needs to be stopped by mandri. It is mandri’s power which allows for the Mazidfire.

This fucks with the convo where ayram explains to obo his purpose.


Concussive

I didn’t give him a spark, I resusitated it.

Accelerate plans.

            <Text>Mandri found a lucky stone—a hollow tube of rock scrubbed smooth by sand. When Moteah poured water onto it, its ruddy surface took on the sheen of glass. Obo said it wasn’t a stone, but a reed. Mandri put it in with the rest of his lucky stones anyways. He’d spent a lot of time trying to think of uses for them, but as of yet had nothing.</Text>

Mandri said with open arms, “I take it you’re not comfortable with me wearing this?”
“Like the woman said, Papi’s dead. He don’t want em.”
Mandri could feel the rest of the Ayramun glaring at him.
“I don’t know,” said Mandri, “It seems a bit rude.”
“Ain’t it, though?” said a voice in the shadows behind. It was the same gruff man from earlier, named Weeg. Weeg was so dirty and disheveled that he looked like he’d just got done rolling down a dune. His face was unreasonably flat. His nose must have been broken a hundred times.





Hill rushed by them both, and his torch flame whipped behind like a flag.
Mandri and Seb both looked after Hill in bewilderment. Just beyond the stout man was the bald, pale, and naked Obo fleeing into the darkness. Hill wavered briefly at the sight of Obo’s exceptional agility, for the Mazid looked part lizard as he leaped from rock to wall to the ceiling, and bound back again. Hill shouted back towards Seb, “Go get Ayram!” and then he charged on again into the dark.

“Number of people lucky enough to die and get found fresh-dead by us Ayramun is, like, what? Two people managed it? You lucky as a prince to be standin’ there alive.”
“I guess.”
“What were you doin’ out there in the hills anyway?”
“I have no idea.”
A large brutish man, larger than Tob and with a face that looked like it’d been broken in half said, “I’ll tell you what he was doin’. That boy there’s a curse. Sun as my light, that boy there is gonna get us all killed.”
“That so?” Tob asked.
“Seb didn’t jus’ find him dead in the hills. He found him in the same damn ravine we was ambushin’. An look what happened—more n’ half of us dead.”

            <Text>On the sixth day, or was it the seventh? On the seventh day, they crossed a charnel road, and on the other side of it was a small rock cairn splattered with white paint. This marked the grave of a pilgrim. An epitaph had been written on a stick of wood and stuck in the ground right next to it, but this had been scoured into illegibility.
No one knew which shrine the charnel road led to, or from which city the road began. Somehow, in the quest to reason it out, Obo offended Purl by telling her she was too kind. 
“It’s a good thing,” he said to her as she scowled back. “By the way, that’s the reason you won’t be able to control me, not completely. A Minder has to have a cruel disposition. You have to want to hurt people.”
“I’ve killed people.”
“I doubt you were cruel about it. You don’t hate deeply. Or perhaps you hate too deeply.”
Obo’s words seemed to strike a chord in Purl, but she turned away and said, “I don’t care what you think.”</Text>

            <Title>Amalgamete</Title>
            <Text>Mandri hated terror. There’s nothing complicated about it. He was well familiar with its tired routine—first it startled him into stupidity, and then it spurred him into action, or reigned him in, according to the flavor of the moment. He knew it was coming and he knew what it would do and yet here it was and there was no fighting it. When that roaring beam of Mazydfire lit up the night, he became terrified, and the next thing he knew, he was running through an accursed temple’s bowels, bumping his nose and toes on stone shelves and cabinet footings because he wasn’t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn’t allowed, according to Moto, because that there wasn’t any time to light one up, even though it only took five half-halves of a god-damned finger. As it goes with terror—reason is not allowed to a say. If it was, he might have been able to reason out why, in response to threat of a hunting Mazyd, the best course of action was to flee deeper into a demon haunted world.
He hated these Ayramun for leading him here. He loved these Ayramun for protecting him from the dark. He hated them and loved them in equal turns. Moto led them into a dark dead end, and Mandri hated him. Moto led them into a windowed hall flush with fresh night air, and Mandri loved him. Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated him. Mandri slipped on spot of Seb’s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated him—Seb was the sole exception to this confusing succession of states in which blurred together and hinted at a deeper reality which Mandri could not articulate. Love and hate, it seemed, were only crude approximations—it was as if there was a color portrait to be painted here, but all Mandri had were pigments black and white.
It reminded him, and this was not the time for it, but it reminded him of Solraheen, for Solraheen was both comforting and terrifying—Mandri feared a loving Divine. There were emotions at play that he was not at all equipped to understand. 
He hated Elrahet for her witchy mumblings as she scampered along in the dark.
“This isn’t right. This isn’t right. This isn’t right.”
He loved her because she seemed to be the only one who knew what was going on.
“This way!” she barked when Moto ran passed a doorway.
Purl yanked Mandri’s arm.
“Put your sword away you idiot!”
He didn’t even know he had it out.
“You’re going to stab me,” she said.
“I won’t.”
“I feel safer with it out.”
“Damn you Moto!” Purl cursed.
“What did I do?”
“You gave this idiot a sword!”
Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade. Good thing he did, because not long after, Moto took a sharp turn into another dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. 
“What are we doing?” Moteah asked with venom. Moto, the prime object of her ire, turned towards the dark and said, “I think we should wait here for Ayram.”
“Don’t act like you meant to run in here.”
Seb, who was bringing up the rear, said, “There’s no point in waitin’ up for Ayram. He’s dead.”
Moto dismissed Seb’s dour pronouncement with a sneer. “Ayram’s not dead.”
“Is too,” said Seb. “Saw him swallowed by Mazydfire.”
“He fell down a canyon before the flame even touched him.”
“That’s not what I saw,” said Seb.
“Seb, you can’t see shit.”
“Ayram fell down a canyon?” Moteah asked.
Moto said, “He jumped into it. To dodge the flame.”
And so commenced an argument, and Mandri began to hate them all. As the insults and half- charges flew, Mandri retreated into a dark corner of this small room. He wished it wouldn’t have been so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. No temple he’d ever been in was so black—and it wasn’t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps because there weren’t any light fittings bolted to the walls. He looked up and noticed that the flat ceiling was completely free from the soot of ages, and in this place there was no hope of natural light—Shulgi was much too thick in the belly for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help you lose yourself, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.
There was art all along the walls for Mandri to distract himself with. Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around this apparent dead end, and they were stacked upon the each other from floor to the ceiling. The walls all throughout the place were carved up like this, and most were painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with lines and lines of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears, there were garden scenes where Old Jandri kings strolled along in quiet contemplation, there were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of martyrs screaming Solraheen’s name as tongues of flame licked their ribs.
Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that was being told. It reminded him of Hrkan tomb art—some rich prick decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when the tomb’s door is sealed, no one is allowed to have a look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and now no one is looking. A monumental waste of good pigment.
No places for candles in a tomb.
No room for natural light either.
Maybe this place’s purpose was to be a tomb.
If it were true, maybe it’d be written here on the wall. Unfortunately, Mandri wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at in terms of narrative. He wasn’t even sure if he were reading the panels in the right direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether?
He looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight. It was hard to see, because not only was the light too dim, but it blinked every time Moto waved his frantic arms to try and express his argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene—the moment of Solraheen’s apotheosis, when He emerged out of void. It was represented here by a blank face emerging from a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark ripping out the stone. Each claw was as wide as two fingers.
“Uh, guys.”
The others were too engrossed in their squabble to hear him. Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.
Mandri raised his voice.
“Hey!”
They all stopped bickering.
“Look at this,” he said, and he pointed up at the beastly gash in Solraheen’s forehead. 
Seb stepped over, studied the defacement, and shrugged. “It’s just some scratches,” he said.
Elrahet waddled over and held her torch high. She stood on her tiptoes to get her eye close to the claw mark. Mandri thought he saw her sniff.
When she balanced back down on her heels her face was gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.
“It is as I feared,” she said.
“What does that mean?” said Purl.
“It means we need to leave.” 
Then the old witch twirled, black robes fluttering, and trotted off into the darkness, expecting everyone else to follow. 
Moto pushed past Mandri to confront Elrahet.
“What about Ayram?”, he asked.
“Ayram can handle himself,” she said, shrugging him off.
“But you don’t even know where you’re going!”
“We make for the backdoor.”
“But you said you don’t remember—”
“It doesn’t matter!” Elrahet declared, and she whacked her conclusion into Moto’s leg with her staff. “The faster we are out of here, the better, and that won’t happen if we’re standing still!”
Their journey through the dark began anew with Elrahet leading the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the smudges in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because she had a vague memory that Shulgi’s backdoor was, in her words, “down and then out.”
They ventured so far down into this temple mountain that it seemed to Mandri this temple was upside down. A temple’s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens, and there should be an ascension to the roof where the penitent could await the coming dawn. But they went down, and the further down they went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. 
Elrahet led them down a wide fan of stairs whose ceiling bowed up into a black void. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts were closing in on them. And after the ceiling, the walls disappeared. Suffice to say, Mandri no longer felt like he was ‘inside’.  The Ayramun were a splotch of light in a sea of darkness. If not for the hard stone under his feet and the faux-brick pattern on it, he would have supposed that they had wandered straight into the depths of Shis.
“I remember now,” said Elrahet.
She practically sprinted past two enormous spiraled columns. These columns were easily four times the size of those in Shulgi’s entrance hall, and they straddled a long tongue of obsidian-studded floor which marked a processional way. The Ayramun hurried past these columns, and ahead was another pair, then another, and another, when finally, they came upon an incredible natural sandstone throne set atop a plinth of granite. Its seat was smooth and featureless, as if carved by a river, and its back was a petrified spire of flame licked into a curl by an unseen of wind.
 Elrahet stopped before it, took a moment catch her breath, then said, “There’s a hall behind.”
She scuttled around the throne, and the Ayramun followed. There behind the throne was a perfectly square doorway cut into the thick wall. They all filtered through, and they hadn’t gotten ten steps into its hall, when Elrahet stopped again. 
Something on the ground had caught her attention.
She set her torch low to the floor.
There, splattered across the stone was a dried splotch of blood. She bent down to touch it, and as she did, a voice rose out of the dark, a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed it was the voice of the mountain itself. 
“What do you make of it, whitch?”
The echo rattled Mandri’s bones, and then came another bout of stupefying terror, for an unaccounted-for voice weighs heavy on the scale of terror, heavier still if it comes spewing out a dark abyss, heavier still if it wheezes and warbles as if issuing forth from the throat of a tortured horse. 
Moto sent his torch spinning in this voice’s direction—straight down the hall. The torch clattered along the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop before a fold of skin.
In its upshot light was a beast for which terror was a pure emotion. It was so large, fat, and bloated, that no of it’s form could be seen. It seemed nothing but a giant blob of bleeding pustules and skin. Mandri knew there there must be a mouth in there somewhere, for its rasping voice echoed out again. 
“Let them shee my gloooory.”
Two enormous braziers erupted in flame to reveal an unmistakably human bag of bloat clogging up the hall, mounding up all the way to the ceiling where, sticking out of the top like a cork was the upper torso of a skinny, white-bearded man shawled in a tattered green robe. On his head was a crown.
Scurrying around in front of this overgrown freak were demon roaches the size of dogs, at least ten of them, with oily-black shells and human hands on the ends of their spike-studded legs. Their faces were an unholy mix between a insect’s and a man’s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling, their mouths gulping air like a fish out of water.
Mandri turned to run, but there was no where to go for climbing on the wall behind were four more of those demon beetles. 
“Hag beetles,” said Elrahet. “The spines inside their shells can kill, and their shells are hard as rock.”
A rumbling laugh boomed out from the fleshy king’s stomach. “Keep your namesh to yourshelf, whitch.”
Elrahet turned to face the bloated lord. “Most putrid king,” she said, “none of us are worthy of a names, and yet a name, the good lord gives.”
The creature smiled. His teeth were black and his spit was tar. The beetle-demons clicked and clacked their, vibrating with their master’s mood.
“A name?” the foul lord mused. “A NAME!? Hhhhaaaaaahhhhh!” The laugh sent a shudder through his whole bloated body. “Poison yourselves with your names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. I and mine are more than a name can bear! LOOK at me!”
He spread his tiny arms against his girth.
Elrahet spat and said, “You have perverted your flesh, Greskal.” She pronounced his name with a scornful leer.
The creature laughed again, burping and as it did.
“Ugh-urp-ahuhhheheh… Greshkal!?… Hah!”
He leaned his bulk forwards to resettle his great stomach after the burp had disturbed it. Mandri suspected that somewhere under the ruddy and calloused flabs of skin on the floor were legs, but he doubted this demon king could do much more than lean.
“I am no longer Greshkal,” the bloated wretch said. “I have become…I have become becoming itshelf! Name me, whitch—I am Amalgamete!”
The echo of his great voice filled the hall and stunned all gathered into silence, all save the hag bettles, who chattered and clicked their teeth.
“Do you think me ugly?” Greskal said. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have split and ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from tar, living tar, for in the dim light it seemed that the lump of flesh in his grip was wriggling like a squealing piglet. He let this piglet slip, and the flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.
“This flesh is the world,” said Greskal as he caressed the welling redness. “Don’t you shee? This is the shtuff of the world into which a Spark thrown. The whiter the light of the Spark, the more this filth gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would shupplicate yourshelves before me as your god.”
Elrahet looked down her nose at Greskal and said, “Your son had a stronger stomach than you. Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.”
A paroxysmal twitch shuddered through Greskal’s body. He pointed to Elrahet and shouted, “Silence that ensnaring womb!”
A black spike shot out of a hag beetle’s body and flew at Elrahet. Moto’s sword lashed out with blinding speed and sent the spike bouncing harmlessly aside. 
Greskal grunted his annoyance. Then he said, with a disapproving stare, “You should offer yourshelves willingly. Be joined together inside my shtomach and taste union for once in your miserable livesh.”
“Oh?” said Elrahet. “You don’t want us to fight back? Does stressed meat taste fouler? Poor thing.”
Greskal grimaced. Tar pooled in his bottom lip. With the natural grace of a man made king from birth, he twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, and waved his minions onward.
“Defense first, keep them off,” Moto said to his sister. “I’ll make the killing blows.”
“I’m going to do what I need to do,” Moteah said as she threw down her pack and drew her sword.
Seb was sweating, staring at the doorway behind them that led to throne room.  There the beetle-demons were now creeping down the wall.
Purl tried to slap the terror out of his cheek.
“Wake up!”
Seb looked Purl in the eye, and said, “You insane!? We don’t have a chance!”
Purl slapped him again.
“Seb! Get hold of yourself!”
Seb spat at her feet. He took off running towards the throne room door.
It was only a ten steps distance. 
Seb made it five.
A hag bettle jumped off the wall, straight towards him. As it flew, its shell parted open, and a blur shot out of it’s back. 
Seb’s body went limp. A black spike was stuck right through his chest, through his pack, and even further—through the Riga’s swaddled head.
Mandri wanted to scream in horror, but no sound came out of his lungs. Seb fell to his knees, and then to the floor, gargling on blood and borcandi juice as he went. His killer, still clinging to him like a leech, retracted its spike back into its shell with a horrifying schlick.
Mandri pulled his sword and held it out as Moto had taught him. His arm trembled. Moto’s lessons didn’t prepare him to deal with an eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis. And there were four of them arrayed in front of him like a pack of a dogs.
“What do I do!?” he screamed at Purl.
“Just stab the damned things!”
The next thought that went through Mandri’s head was that things seem to jump faster when they’re jumping at you.
He shrieked, closed his eyes, and swung out.
He felt his blade hit the beetle’s shell.
There was a squelching crunch.
He was still alive.
The beetle demon was dead at his feet. Its back was absolutely crushed. It’s murderous spike twitched feebly on the floor, and somehow Mandri’s sword was completely bloodless.
The other three beetle-demons took to the walls and scurried hurriedly back across the hall towards Greskal, for Ayram standing in the shadow of the throne room doorway. His spear’s chisel tip was dripping black with beetle-demon blood.
“Oh,” Mandri muttered. “Thank god.”
Ayram’s face, his beard, and his shoulders were plastered in sand.
Elrahet asked, “What’s wrong?”
“Arm’s useless.”
His left arm was tucked into his robe.
“So that’s Greskal?” he asked.
“It is.”
Ayram sighed and gritted his teeth. “We don’t have time for this.”
He hoisted his spear up on his shoulder and walked towards the putrid king.
Greskal smiled at the sight. “I’ve been exshpecting you,” he said. “I have a gift eshpecially for you.”
“Not interested,” Ayram growled.
“Give me a moment. A moment, and you’ll have it.”
Greskal rolled his eyes into white and he gave his head a good shake. This seemed to knock loose some internal blockage, and his shoulders shook as his spine twinged and quivered. Then a wave rolled under his great bulk like the ocean rolling under a seaweed shore. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder. Then Greskal screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered. The wailing of his voice was run ragged by all the souls o those he had consumed.
He leaned back and another wave rippled his stomach. A boil burst open, and in its place was a cavity. Blackness oozed out of it, and when the inevitable shudder came this hole ripped wider. A taloned hand burst forth, and out of the Amalgamete’s stomach poured a great demon slathered in tar.
Half man, it stood up on two legs. Half lizard, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It was bigger than Ayram by a head and had the muscles of a prize-winning ox. Its eyes were blood red, double lidded, and its pupils were embered orange. It licked the air with a forked tongue, caught Ayram’s scent, and hissed. Then it stretched out its limbs for the first time, its arms were ribbons of muscle, it’s back a whip, it’s jaw full of hateful fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself, the coursing power, it curled it’s and seemed to know what it was meant to do—if it didn’t, all it need do to learn was to read the fear on Mandri’s face.
It growled, and the vibration sent the hag-beetles clicking and scratching their spikes against the insides their shells. They turned their dumb, lidless eyes towards the Ayramun.
“Go on, my children,” Greskal wheezed. He winced against another violent spasm that shook his whole body. Then he fainted, and the hag beetles began again to crawl.
“Get back!” Ayram shouted. “Against a wall!” He twirled his spear under his good right arm and spat a challenge towards the reptile freak. A snarl of fangs was the answer, and the demon took a step towards his prey—only one step.
The beetles, still clicking their excitement, scurried wide around both giants while Moto and Moteah herded Mandri, Elrahet, and Purl back into a corner. The hag beetles closed ranks behind Ayram, though they weren’t at all that interested in him. They kept on creeping along the hall, while some had ascended up into the darkness of the ceiling. Mandri could just make out the dull shine of their eyes as they took up positions directly above him.
Ayram took a step backwards.
Then another step.
He and the black demon lizard were at least twenty yards apart, but for the speed between them it might as well have been a single step. The thunder clap of their meeting sent unleashed chaos in the room.
So much happened so fast that Mandri couldn’t keep track.
On the floor, three beetles jumped at once—maybe it was more, he wasn’t sure because the blur of bodies and limbs was terrifying. At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. Before Mandri could flick the tip of his sword, Moto brought his blade down on that hag beetle’s back, and in a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue right behind the beetle’s head.
This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him. Though it’s head tumbled to the floor, it’s body wasn’t fully dead yet—it seized and spasmed, one of its human-handfeet slapped Mandri in the cheek. Mandri would have laughed if it weren’t for the sight of another hag beetle up on the ceiling. It dropped. Things fall faster when they’re falling at you.
This beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri’s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle’s neck and right onto Mandri’s face. The living beetle’s spike flew out of its back, but the dumb thing missed Mandri’s nose because the its eyes were on top its head. It struck out again, and missed again. Twice more, the spike tap-tapped against the stone.
“Dumb bitch!” Mandri shouted.
The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that it’s fishy eyes were staring down right at him.
“Oh, shit.”
Mandri tugged hard on the dead body between them, and as the spike flew down at his face it met instead with the dead beetle’s shell. The beast tried to pound through it like a hammer. Mandri hid himself until somehow, by the grace of Solraheen, that dumb beetle’s severed head fell right in front of his nose.
Purl pulled Mandris sword out of it and said, “Get up.”
Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles, but his hips and thighs were pinned. 
“Give me a hand,” he said.
“Really?!” said Purl. She had one good hand and wasn’t about to drop the sword.
“Kick it off me!”
Purl kicked the top beetle off him, and Mandri was able to push himself free from the other. He got to his feet, wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage—eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smushed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back along the hall. One of these ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the demon, and it was sliced in half by the lizard’s thrashing tail.
Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his spear so fast that it seemed to curved and snap suddenly straight against the lizard’s fending tail. Sparks flew, and the demon recoiled and raged and leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand, then its tail, knocking Ayram’s bar aside as the next set of talons were coming round. Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below the blow, to leave nothing but a swirl of dust between them.
Only now that they were standing still could Mandri see how much they’d ravaged eachother. The demon’s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram’s robe had been half-clawed off and ribbons of flesh hung off his side, exposing the yellow fat, the red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time that he exhaled.  
Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked Moteah’s rump.
“Help him!” the old witch shouted.
Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag-beetles easily enough, but the Newborn was an enemy beyond them.
“Go!” Elrahet screamed.
Moteah took off running towards the battle. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first.
They got halfway to Ayram when the lizard noticed their coming. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and crouched down like a cat, its long tail raised like a scorpion. Outnumbered, it slowly retreated down the hall.
“It’s scared!” said Moto as he and his sister took up positions at Ayram’s bleeding side.
Ayram spat a glob of red and said, “Careful. Don’t let it—”
The newborn jumped.
It jumped all the way up to the ceiling, then bounded off it and over the heads of the three warriors. It hit the ground running straight for Mandri, Elrahet, and Purl.
Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled horror underneath its permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift bounds. Wide-eyed, Mandri stared down his final moments with a terrified calm. Time seemed to condense, allowing him to appreciate the beauty of his killer. This demon was enormous, strong, sleek, and aside from its flapping jaw, it was perfectly symmetrical. No ugly ears. Its scaly skin glistened in the sheen of its afterbirth. Its final leap was tremendous. The sheer size could swallow him up. Curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery—it rolled under Ayram’s spear, which missed.
But the lizard’s bladed tail didn’t miss—it ripped a gash right across Ayram’s exposed stomach.
The lizard crashed into Mandri and sent him sprawling. 
When Mandri recovered, he expected to look up and see the demon hollowing out his chest.
It was on the floor, lifeless. 
Elrahet’s blade was hilted in the top of its skull.
Ayram sank to his knees. A stream of blood issued from the fissure in his stomach.
Elrahet screamed as she ran and caught the giant in her bosom.
Moteah and Moto sprinted up behind. 
“Let me see,” said Moto.
Ayram’s strength gave way and he slumped down onto the old witch’s shoulder. Moto and Moteah seized his arms before Elrahet crumbled under his weight, and they all helped him down to the ground. Elrahet gently laid his head down on the stone and wiped away the muck of battle from his brow with her thumb.
“My child,” said Elrahet. “My child…this I can not heal.”
Ayram’s great heads were clutching at his stomach. His breathing was staggered and wet. He looked at his witch, and his eyes seem filled with fright. He tried to speak—Elrahet shushed him with a finger to her lips.
“I know,” she said. “I know…I will sing your name to Solraheen, and He will know. He will know.”
Ayram’s eyes darted to Moto. He reached out with his bloody hand and his fingers found the strength to grasp Moto’s arm as tight as vice. For a brief moment, the two men beheld each other, shared an unspoken word, then Ayram’s fingers loosened and the light went out of his eyes.
He was dead.</Text>

            <Title>Shis</Title>
            <Text>Mandri did not have to look long for an unnatural hole which might lead down to Shis, as there was one in the cluttered study that lay adjacent to the throne room.
The king’s study.
Greskal’s study.
The man must have found some dark grimoire that lured him to seek succor in Shis. Or so Mandri supposed. Finding that book would be difficult, as it seemed every book in the room had its spine cut and its innards loosed, and sheets of paper were scattered about like moon moths. Some were stuck to the walls. Some alighted on the large upturned table that lay canted on the far side of the room, its legs sticking up like a bloated cow. Some paper fluttered on the rim of a shield-sized hole in the center of the floor. A green carpet hung down into that hole’s depths, a carpet ripped to rags by a track of claw marks. Ascending claw marks, judging from the direction of the rip.
Moto dropped his torch down into this hole, revealing a red rock floor some few meters away.
“This should be fun,” said Obo. Mandri agreed. He felt invincible with Obo staring over his shoulder, though he was a tad worried that if a snarling demon dripped down out of the black, Obo’s purging flame might singe his cheek.
Mandri paused to take a quick sip of his God’s Eye burgeon, for the God’s Eye sight had faded. Obo had preternatural senses, and he wanted them too, especially now that he’d be taking the lead. When he’d stowed that burgeon away nice and safe inside his robe, he jumped down into that hole and picked up Moto’s torch.
At first there was a single tunnel, and its walls were fixed in brick and reinforced with wooden beams, but these constructions soon gave way to a meandering maze of natural stone which felt as old as the world itself. Mandri led, torch in hand, then Moteah followed, with Moto following close behind. The air was alive with the sounds of footfalls and heavy breathing—some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight, no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons waiting for a chance to strike. After some tracking and backtracking through this maze, Mandri turned a tight corner and came upon a doorless stone arch of ordinary size. This arch’s posts were perfectly plumb and square, and unfamiliar symbols were etched into them.
Mandri hesitated.
“Cold feet?” Moteah asked behind him. 
Mandri’s feet were cold, but that had nothing to do with it. He waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock and asked of anyone, “Can you read this?”
“It’s Schisol’s creed,” Obo said.
Every good Jandri child knows the words to Schisol’s creed. It is a creed which has floated through the Old Jandri world since forever. Solitants address it in mocking tones to rob the words of their power. In Hrkan law, whenever the creed is written in text, each line must be accompanied by a marginal note that explains the utter foolishness of it.

Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth.	(Premise assumes conclusion)
Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right. 	(Ambiguous terms.)
Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.	(Demonstrably wrong.)
Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be together.	(Pseudoprofundity)

That final, ominous line has spurred many a suicide pact, despite demystification. Such events are the work of demons, Solitants say. Demons put it in people’s heads that they’ll be less lonely in Shis if they bring other people down with them. It explains murder-suicides too. It’s all the influence of demons. And here Mandri was, heading down to Shis, being followed.
“We should keep moving,” Moteah said as she nudged Obo’s litter.
Mandri could not take his sight from the threshold. The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of symbols. He dared to reach out and touch them, and he found the grooves to be free of dust. All of it was remarkably clean.
Obo’s reassuring voice popped into his ear. “Whatever’s down here, I’ll handle it.” He then gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder, and confidence returned to Mandri’s legs. He stepped through the gate.
What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone arch made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs, and that was barely enough to allow descent. This path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. As Mandri had only one hand, he gave his torch to Obo to hold. And again his confidence fled—Obo might be able to save him from demons, but he couldn’t chase away a void such as this. 
When he’d shimmied halfway across, he slipped on a loose shard of rock that went tumbling into the void. He was able to regain his balance fairly easily, but he didn’t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the void, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up from below. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him. Neither Moto nor Moteah said anything, and so they journeyed on.
The rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. In places, the walls were so narrow that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways. Obo had to walk, which for him meant swiveling along on his stubs. Next came a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill. He started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself. The torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable—hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows that looked like shallow divots gave way to potholes that twisted his ankle. But the longer it went on the less and less he cared about these scrapes and bruises, because the ways were much more up-and-down than anything in the desert, or even the Goree Pass, and an unremitting burn set into his thighs.
They rested for a while underneath a hang of rock. Moto set up a house of twigs, set them alight, and when these twigs burned to ash they moved on again. They walked for another long while, became sore again, rested again, and at this point no one could agree on whether it was night or day above.
The God’s Eye sight came to Mandri on the third march. First came that familiar flash of white. His vision was flooded with a cosmic swirl of shimmering brightness, and when Mandri shucked his mind free of this blinding vision, he could see everyone’s Sparks stirring in their stomachs. Obo’s gold Spark outshone them all, but bright as he was, bright as they all were, they illuminated nothing. The dark dominion was oppressive, nothing like the Sand above, where even the rocks were coated with fibrous purpose. Down here the rocks were dead, and the only threads of purpose he could see were those which connected their Sparks, as well as those few threads which stretched out of their Sparks and into the tunnel ahead, drawing out the paths which they would walk.
Mandri followed his own thread of purpose and traced its movement with his stomach-dwelling Spark.
It was strange, seeing the future.
Following it was even stranger—did he follow it because he could see it and wanted to know where it went? Or did he follow it because it drew him along like some sort of puppet. The others were puppeted along, no doubt, as they couldn’t see what he saw. They couldn’t see the threads, and so they couldn’t see the choice, much less make one.
Then they came to a fork in the tunnel. All threads of purpose chose to wander right. Moto and Moteah argued about which way to go. Mandri stayed silent. Obo claimed he could hear faint echoes coming from the right, and so they chose to head right.
But Mandri knew that turning right was not a choice. The noise that Obo heard had a cause, and that cause was also caused, and so causes carry on in an infinite regress which could only end in the hand of Solraheen weaving a desired future. Mandri truly believed that this thread he followed was put there by Solraheen, and it was this great faith that compelled him to see it through.
Soon, the way spilled out into a short, brickworked hall, and his shoes slapped onto flat stone tile. This hall then opened up into a cavern whose size was difficult to estimate. It was large enough to hide the echoes of their shuffling feet, so it must have been larger than Shulgi’s throne room. And the entirety of this cavern floor was paved in tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps or so, the floor’s simple square pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. 
This black sun was an unfamiliar design, like a flower with its petals closed and all points pointing inwards. In some sense, it was the opposite of the eightfold Jandri sun. Mandri took it to be a sign of Schisol, and he did not stop to study any of them. He hunched along as if sneaking. He almost laughed at the sight of Moto and Moteah skulking along behind, because if any demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they’d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches.
But there were no demons. In all the blackness around them, there were no demons or demon Sparks. And there weren’t any threads of purpose spelling out their doom. There was only that faint swirl of guiding purpose floating in front of them and disappearing into the dark. 
They walked through this cavern for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern’s end. The purpose ended here—they could go no further. The stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a monstrous stone double-door that would require a team of oxen to open. These doors seemed sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures mostly, snarling demons doing unmentionable things to men and women unfleshed.
Set atop these doors was a stone head, bald like Obo’s, and twice as unnerving because it seemed to be licking its lips at sight of Mandri’s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders. The rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly limbs stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door’s bottom hinges.
Moteah eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn. “What do we do now?”
Mandri was dismayed to see his thread of purpose knot up at the base of the door. “I don’t know,” he said. “I think I just stand here and…”
“Knock?” said Moto.
Mandri reached out to knock, but there wasn’t a clean spot for it. The door’s panel was too full of sculpted, snarling demons. In the end he made no decision, as a thread of purpose alighted out of nothing to guide his knuckles toward the forehead of an anguished man who was being yanked along by hooks set into his skin.
The sound of Mandri’s knock was soft and barely there, two quick raps.
He took a step back, and waited.
He did not wait long, for out of the air around him there arose a voice, a woman’s voice, a voice as old and aggrieved as Elrahet’s.
“Come in,” it said, and it was followed by the sound of stone grinding against stone as these great doors of Shis swiveled in their hinges. They swiveled inward, and the doors’ two halves split to reveal a split of black. Tucked inside this darkness was a golden Spark.
The Spark floated forth and the torchlight revealed its figure—an old woman, tall and graceful, robed in a single black satin sheet that draped down to the floor but did not touch. Mandri recognized her long nose and imperious glare instantly—it was Pel.
It was the demon-witch who’d killed his ox back on his farm in Meskalim. The witch who’d set this all into motion, if causes could begin with her. Foul causes surely did. Not Solraheen’s hand, but Schisol’s.
Moto and Moteah drew their swords.
Pel drew a thin lipped smile.
“Oh, please,” she said to them, “Where are your manners?”
Obo, confident in his litter, said to the siblings, “Put your swords away.”
They both hesitated, but when Moteah sheathed her sword, so did Moto.
“Thank you,” said Pel. “And thank you,” she said as she cast an adoring eye upon Mandri. “You don’t know how long I’ve been trying to end Elrahet, and you managed it perfectly.”
Mandri could not speak. He was entranced by the sight of Pel’s Spark. It was gold, like Elrahet’s, like Obo’s, though it was completely devoid of purpose. Not a single thread in all the world was attached to it.
“Tongue tied?” Pel asked as she glided effortlessly towards him. “Do I frighten you? Speak, Mandrameen. This is your moment.” 
Moto was the one to seize it. “Mazid, Kill her!”
Obo climbed out of his litter and he sat on Mandri’s shoulder like an overgrown cat. He rested his elbow on Mandri’s head and said to Pel, “I’ve heard stories about you.”
“Such irony. A creature spends its short life searching for freedom, and found it by enslaving a Spark.”
“As may be,” said Obo. “But they say that you are my enemy, that you are a great evil, and that I should kill you.”
Pel stood there silently. She was either unwilling or unable to respond. Her face betrayed nothing, set as it was in a stony glare.
Obo said, “Have you nothing to say in your defense?”
Pel curled her lip. “Nothing I say will change what you will do. You will all do what you will.”
“That is a curious turn of phrase,” said Obo. “But, help me understand, was it you who corrupted the old king Greskal and brought forth the Amalgamete?”
“None but the Amalgamete can bring forth the Amalgamete.”
Moto was sweating rain despite the cavern’s chill. He shouted, “Why are you talking to her? Kill her!”
Pel rolled her eyes at the outburst. “Don’t fret, child, I am not the one who condemned you. That was Solraheen, your benevolent, loving, murderous god.”
“She’s Schisol’s shadow—kill her!”
“I am Schisol’s shadow, yes, and proud of it! Know that Solraheen is false and He does not love you. Know that Solraheen never called down that rock of Fabled Black to kill Himself and save the world. Know that this was done by Schisol, know that He sacrificed himself for your sakes, that Solraheen could no longer torture your Sparks.”
“Do you have any proof of your claims?” Obo asked. “Or do witchy women only speak in stories?”
“The proof is the peace that is soon to come. A peace which you will find in the belly of the Amalgamete.”
“I’ve killed your Amalgamete.”
Pel deflected this triumph away with a twitch of her sharp chin. “Another will come. In fact, he stands now on my doorstep.”
Her eyes settled on Mandri and an excited smile played on her lips.
“Mandri?” Obo asked, confused.
“Me?” Mandri echoed.
“You,” Pel said staunchly. “Why else would you be here before me now?”
Mandri’s dignity and vanity welled up his chest, for in no possible world would he assent to eating flesh or looking as foul as that putrid king. He raised his voice and declared, “I’m here because you killed my ox. I’m here because you—”
“Oh, please,” Pel moaned. “Do not bother me with trifles. Know that your grievances are Mandrameen’s, and that Mandrameen is an illusion. Mandrameen was born and he will die, but your real being knows neither beginning nor end. Come with me into Shis, I can show you what I mean. You can bring your friends along.”
It was then that Mandri noticed a new thread of purpose manifesting itself into being. It was drawn from his Spark and it led through Pel’s hip and disappeared behind her, through the doors of Shis.
Mandri took a step back.
“No,” he said firmly. “I’m not going anywhere with you.”
“Why else would you be here?” she asked, and her jagged lips eased into a beatific smile. “Mandrameen, the portrait painter. You’ve painted a thousand faces, but never your own. You may have painted a self-portrait, but know that a true self-portrait is impossible. A mirror hardly helps—you can never capture that look of looking away. And worse, your eyes always see straight into themselves. You are always alert. You are always alive. You are always there. But you have never seen yourself sleeping. You will never see what you look like when you’re dead. Everyone else’s eyes close and will close forever, but you’re own…who’s to say it’s not the world that disappears every time you blink?”
“She’s mad,” Moteah mumbled.
Mandri agreed, but more off-putting than this witch’s rambling was the realization that he hadn’t blinked since the doors of Shis had opened. Maybe it had been longer, maybe not since the God’s Eye burgeon took hold of him. And more than this, Pel had locked her gaze with his, and for a shuttered instant, her true eyes flashed, glowing gold, declaring mystic tidings which Mandri could not comprehend but he could feel—bright, and warm, and thankful.
Then she blinked and her eyes went dark again.
“Do you sleep, Mandrameen? Do you sleep? What happens to Mandrameen when you sleep? Where does he go?”
“I… I’ve never thought about it.”
“Good,” she said. “You’re honest. That’s more than I can say for those who seek an end to their suffering.”
“Kill her already!” Moto pleaded.
Pel seemed pleased to hear Moto’s voice crack.
“Look at this man,” she said as she flicked her beady eyes over the strong-backed Zosan. “See how frightened he is of dying. What does he fear? All he’ll lose are his illusions. Merge his Spark with yours and he shall know peace.”
“Aren’t you forgetting about me?” Obo asked as he readjusted himself atop Mandri’s shoulder. Pel regarded him with an uninterested eye. “You can come along as well.” She then stepped aside to clear a path towards the open doors behind, and she held out an entreating arm towards Mandri. With the back of her hand, she brushed the thread of purpose which led into the void. “Come young Mandrameen. Do not worry about the darkness, your eyes will adjust.”
Mandri stood dumbstruck at the sight of that thread of purpose leading him astray, and he gasped when he realized that he’d taken a step forward.
As quickly as he could manage, he pulled Elrahet’s golden knife from out of his robe, and he slashed that bright white cord in two. The thread of purpose burst into a shimmering mist. Pel hissed and set her furious gaze on Mandri. “Whose purpose do you think you’ve cut?”
Moto and Moteah traded confused looks, unaware of what just happened, and for the first time ever, Obo’s hairless brow scrunched up like paper. “What is she talking about?” he asked.
Pel’s frown curdled into a withering scowl. “I speak of purpose!” she screeched. “Your purpose. Mandrameen’s. Whose purpose have you cut? All the gods are dead, they no longer weave their purpose into our world. All purpose here is yours.” She stared down her long nose at Mandri. “The thread you cut was your own. You put it there, no one else. That frightened you. Why?”
“Because I don’t want to do what you want me to do.”
“Hah! Yes! We speak with Mandrameen! He sees through everyone else’s manipulations except his own. Paints everyone’s picture except his own. Typical. Typical of you all. You slavers of Sparks. You sifters of Selves. Pool your purpose together, and still it will fade.” She turned her scouring stare to the darkness of the cavern, and she threw her voice out into it, saying, “Gentler Sparks….would you grace us with your presence?”
Her request fell into the black, and a moment later the black began stir. Mandri tried to rub the insanity out of his eyes, but yes, the black itself began to stir, and as it weaved and wound like liquid smoke it squelched out growls and shrieks. Bright points of light emerged within it like swallowed stars, and these stars mounded up and grew brighter into full grown Sparks. Then came the pinching laughter of demons—not just two, or three, or twenty demons, for that sky of Sparks was joined by a horde of torch reflecting eyes. Thousands of blinking eyes in a thousand different configurations, all hovering there in the dark—eyes set wide, bovine eyes, mousey eyes, saucer eyes of squid, eightfold sets of spider eyes swaying overhead. 
The first demon to reveal itself was a naked knuckle-walking monkey, vaguely human, with a mouthless face that was scrunched up towards the middle, as if its lips were stuffed up into its nose. Then another set of glowing eyes stepped forth into the light, revealing itself to be a goat headed demon with black Zosan skin and a chiseled physique, and it stood on ungulate legs complete with cloven hooves. This demon was joined by a circle of new grotesqueries, each leaping out, it seemed, from Mandri’s childhood dreams. Every manner of mashed-up anatomy between man, insect, and beast, and this circle of dread surrounded him and his companions, a circle broken only by Pel and the doors of Shis behind her.
“You see,” Pel said, “If you have come to offer yourselves to the slaughter, then I accept.”
Mandri was stuck in shock at the sight of so great an evil—rank upon rank of evil. Enough evil here to bring about the end of days.
“Hold on,” said Obo, unconcerned. “These demons here, they want to kill me?”
“Nothing so crude,” Pel replied. “They simply want to put your Spark back into its rightful place.”
One of the demons nearest Mandri, a tusked woman with the body of a boar snarled and hissed, spraying Mandri’s leg with its stinking spittle.
“She is hungry,” Pel said, amused.
“I’m afraid that this is all unacceptable.”
Obo’s repudiation jolted Pel into amazement. Her thin lips grew tight, her brows jumped, and then she burst into a tremendous fit of laughter, a cackle which was taken up by her demon horde and escalated into a roar.
“Oh, my, my!” she said. “Unacceptable?! My dear creature, we have collected an uncountable number of Sparks throughout the ages. Yours will be no different.”
“Of that uncountable number, how many belonged to Mazid?”
“We have collected the Sparks of gods. I assure you, yours will be no different.”
“Then it seems a peaceable conclusion to our disagreement is not possible.”
“It never was.”
“Very well,” said Obo, and he opened his mouth. His throat ran gold and fire poured out in a beam as bright as the sun, smashing through the air where Pel had been—had been. The old witch expected this turn, and she’d flown away in a blur before Obo’s fire could singe her. Instead, his burst of blazing flame smashed into the doors of Shis.
“Huh,” Obo sputtered. “She’s fast for an old bat.”
Then Pel’s voice screamed out from the void above, “FEAST!”
That word was, as far as witchy pronouncements go, frighteningly unambiguous. It set the sea of demons to chattering—teeth chatter, giggle chatter, yapping-sucking-squealing chatter, and to Mandri’s horror, he saw threads of guiding purpose spool out of these demon’s Sparks and latch onto his own, and onto Obo’s, and onto Moto’s and and Moteah’s. There were so many demons and so many threads that the purpose was thick as a blanket, a circular blanket that split when a black, goat-headed demon took a step forward from the demon’s circle. Next to it was a fish-headed bear giant, and they both loomed large and snarled.
“Relax,” said Obo without a hint of worry, “We can all survive this. If you keep low and—”
The hunting shriek of a demon screeched out as the beast swooped down upon them. This demon was truly frightening—bat-winged and the size of a child, with a child’s flat face and enormous funnel ears that wrapped around its goofy head to frame its pea-sized eyes. It reached down with its feet and splayed its finger-talons wide, and just as it made to shriek again, its whole head was wooshed away by a roaring burst of Mazidfire.
The flame was so hot that it heated the demon’s chest into incandescence. The headless body burst into flames and hurtled overhead like a meteor before crashing into the crowd of demons behind. 
As the first blow struck, all Shis broke loose.
Demons came running, hopping, sliding, striding, galloping towards Mandri and the others. Scales sparkled and muscles bulged, whiskered snouts snapped and fanged maws hissed, pointed beaks screamed for oblivion—but Obo’s golden fire screamed back. He swung his coruscating flame in two great sweeping arcs, and he cut down a circle around Mandri, Moto, and Moteah, obliterating the first rank of evil, cutting the confidence out of that goat-headed demon at the waist. Those that scurried underneath Obo’s sweeping flame—the dog, hog, and lizard demons, the beetle demons—these Obo dispatched with incredible precision and blinding speed as more than twenty beams of fire flared out of his mouth in space of a breath, vaporizing the head of each demented creature on contact. Every smoking corpse burst into flame, leaving a ring of sizzling flesh to serve as stumbling blocks to the rest of the onrushing horde. 
Moto and Moteah gathered close to Mandri, close to Obo, who danced atop Mandri’s shoulder and dealt death to this demon horde. His fire spiraled round and round, and at each turn his flame traveled further out, mowing down larger and larger swathes of evil. In the wake of his golden beam was a smattering of distant explosions as those who fell combusted. 
But the demons were undeterred by the slaughter. On they came. It was not bravery, it was dumb, single-minded evil which drove them to consume all Sparks. And on and on they came. Thousands. Obo blasted birds and bats and all manner of giant insects out of the sky. But more flew and climbed out from unseen holes in the faraway ceiling. Their rippling backs glinted against the flash of Mazidfire, and it seemed the very skin of the cavern rock was writhing, for the swarm of Shis poured forth to protect their nest.
Each of them were tethered by shimmering threads to Mandri’s Spark, yet Obo’s fire spiraled through them all, and one by one these threads burst into mist as their sources were snuffed out. Amongst the roar of fire and agony, Mandri was pricked by the thought that Obo might be a god, a new god for a new age, a god who could conquer malignant purpose. And this little god stood supreme on Mandri’s shoulders, and Mandri could not contain himself as he whooped his excitement. Obo—disgraceful, graceful, pitiful, glorious Obo—was turning away the army of Shis all by himself.
Mandri’s eyes welled up with tears, as being so close to such awesome power was overwhelming. He also cried from the pain as Obo pulled sharply on his hair to keep from falling. But mostly the tears were due to honest awe and fascination. Obo’s pale skin glowed hot as the golden fire poured out of him, and for Mandri, that heat was the sun. He basked in its radiance. He craned his neck to view his savior’s face, and he marveled at the quickness of Obo’s eyes, darting from evil to evil, scouring them with his light.
Then something in Obo’s neck snapped, a muscle or tendon, and Obo’s silver eyes rolled back in their sockets as his flame continued to ruin the dark. His head tilted backwards, undirected, and a worrisome bulge extruded out the side of his white-hot neck until it burst.
Mandri screamed in horror as a gout of golden fire fountained out of that hole in Obo’s throat. Its heat was terrifying, and the force of its surge split the rest of Obo’s neck wide open. Then came a final, sputtering flash of gold, and Obo’s head peeled all the way back onto his shoulders. His fingers lost their grip on Mandri’s hair, and he fell off his perch.
Mandri twisted round and caught the falling Mazid.
“What happened!?” Moteah cried as she scanned the black sky above for some renewed assault which Obo might have missed, but there was only a rain of streaming flames as dead demons fell to the ground.
“Is it dead?” Moto asked as he propped Obo’s head up, hoping the front of Obo’s neck might reattach. But Obo’s eyes did not list from their split-eyed gaze, and his body was fully limp.
Obo had cleared a wide, flaming circle around them, a lake of combusted corpses, but Obo had not killed them all. A thousand threads of murderous purpose stretched through the flames and latched on to Obo’s golden Spark
Mandri wrenched up in rage.
“NO!”
He grabbed hold of his golden knife, and he slashed at those strangling threads as he’d seen Elrahet do. His wild flailing nearly slashed Moto’s hand, but he didn’t care, he slashed out again, and again, and again, and with each slicing stroke, bundles of these puppetry strings fell away, but they grew right back, rejoining themselves to Obo’s Spark.
“They come!” Moteah wailed, and her frightened cry was chased by a bout of cackling laughter as Pel spied their despair from the dark above. She swooped down, and her black robe billowed like smoke. She alighted upon the back of a smoldering toad-man demon whose long tongue rolled out onto the floor. The sight of her beaming smile filled Mandri with rage.
In her hand was her golden blade, and her golden Spark was free from the net of purpose which enmeshed everything else. But Mandri did not need to see a bright white thread to know her purpose, for she licked her long teeth at the sight of Obo’s Spark.
That would not do.
Mandri took his golden knife and sliced open a gash right down Obo’s chest, all the way down to the belly. He reached in and pulled at the ribs, which easily unbuckled from the gleaming white sternum. It opened like the wing of a bird cage, and when Mandri saw his own severed hand laying there in the goop, he almost burst into tears, for that hand was the only part of him that had done anyone any good. There it lay, unused.
“Halt!” Pel shouted. The horde of demons halted by her side. The command was also meant for Mandri, and an anxious quiver split Pel’s lips. “Put down the knife,” she said. “You know not what you do.”
Mandri gripped the knife more tightly. He looked down at Obo’s spherical stomach which listed in the oozing, smoking mess that was Obo’s insides. And there was Obo’s golden Spark. Mandri did not know what to do with it. He only knew that he didn’t want Pel to have it. More than anything he’d ever wanted, he wanted to stop that old witch from swallowing this blessed Spark. 
He reached down with his blade and nicked the stomach’s wet curve. An amber juice spilled out and mixed in with the rest of Obo’s muck.
And the Spark was there, bright as ever. A glorious sliver of its golden light peeped through the hole in the membrane and muscle.
Mandri hesitated.
There was a thread of purpose connecting him to it.
“Yes!” Pell cackled. “Deny my will. Do what you want. Be young Mandrameen and swallow that Spark.”
An anxious moment passed as Mandri wondered what he should do. The many faces of evil surrounded him. Their number was dwarfed by the darkness. Mandri tried to find the thread which marked his future winding through them, but it was all too complex. In the end, it was the sight of Obo’s broken face which made his mind, and at that same instant, Pel let loose a wild scream and took flight. She shot straight for Mandri, and the shock of her gnashing teeth nearly cowed him.
Mandri bent and sipped that liquid Spark into his mouth, then swallowed.
The Spark slimed down his throat.
Pel, flying furious, dodged Moto and Moteah’s swinging swords for their savage arcs were betrayed by arcs of preceding purpose. And just before her gnashing teeth smacked into Mandri’s chest, Obo’s golden Spark merged with Mandri’s own.
At once he was struck by both the witch and an all encompassing bliss. His body crashed to the floor while his mind was lost in senseless joy. Nothing mattered. This wasn’t despair, this was liberation. He was at the bottom of being, and down there was a warmth there that he could dwell. There was a presence there. He was being hugged. Somehow, Obo was with him, as was Elrahet, and that gnawing loneliness which plagued him since he came wailing out of his mother’s womb was gone, gone as if it were never there.
He was brought back to reality by Pel’s haunting laughter.
He lay on the ground, and she was kneeling over him. The brightness of her Spark was dazzling. The brightness of his own Spark glinted in her eyes, but she did not move to feast. And in the depths of Mandri’s bliss, her smile took on new meaning. Instead of delighting in his fear, she seemed satisfied, as if his swallowing of the Spark were a job well done.
“Beautiful,” she muttered as she marveled at Mandri’s joy. And more than admiration, the look in her eyes was one of longing. She locked her gaze with his, and Mandri could feel the emotion pouring out of her as vividly as if she were his mother, a lover, a dearest friend, a most hated enemy. All their history felt tied together, and this was a final parting.
“You see, don’t you, that there is a being greater than yourself.”
She then raised her knife in the air and brought it down upon her own belly. She ripped the gash wide with a pained jerk. Blood poured over her fingers, and with her free hand, she reached in, grabbed her stomach, and pulled it out of her belly.
Her stomach’s mouth had been severed, but the intestines trailed along like a horrible, squelching, worm. She lowered her stomach’s open lip to Mandri’s awestruck mouth.
“Savor the taste,” she wheezed as she tipped her stomach like a wine bag.
Her Spark spilled out and it forced its way into Mandri’s throat. Reality twanged as Schisol’s gift merged with Solraheen’s—twinned divinities combined into one inside his body.
Mandri felt he might explode.
His flesh was not built to house this power.
He coughed.
His stomach spasmed.
Pel’s bony hands fell upon his mouth and forced his jaw shut. With each new breath, her strength dwindled, and as the seed of divinity took root in a stomach fold, she fell back. The smack of her shoulders against the ground forced out an eonic sigh.
With her death, the net of purpose which bound the horde of demons snapped. Their snarling, spitting, chatter went silent, and they all stood as dumb as cattle. Moto and Moteah huddled together against the weight of what they’d witnessed. The demon nearest to them, a bubble-backed ox with a single fang, mooed at them as if in recognition. Then out of that demon’s pink spark came a wiggling thread of purpose. It latched onto the wiggling tail of a sand cat demon with reticulated fur.
The Ox turned its great head towards the cat. Slobber dripped down its jowl. It let loose a bovine bleat, then charged. The cat yowled and reared, and as fast as a thunderclap the whole cavern erupted into chaos—the whole demonic horde fell upon itself. Snake and fowl chased each other. Lizard-man squared off against lizard-woman. Limbs and blood and bodies went flying through the air. Fangs and fingernails ripped at every manner of stomach, and if any demon stopped to eat, its own flesh was torn.
Mandri jumped up with such vigor as he had never felt. He grabbed Pel’s golden knife out of her stomach, and he ran towards the huddled siblings. Their Sparks shone bright. They were almost all he could see. Moteah’s face was a blur. Moto’s voice seemed disembodied.
“We need to get out of here!” Moto screamed as a bat-man demon flew low, chasing a giant fly with the head of a purse-lipped fish.
Mandri handed Pel’s golden knife out to the blur that was Moto.
“Swing it in the air,” he said.
“What?”
Mandri lashed out with his own golden knife and cut a thread of demonic purpose as it wandered towards Moto’s hip.
“Just start swinging and follow me!”
Mandri raced away. The siblings followed, and he charted a certain path through the ravenous, self-defeating horde. He hopped over flailing tail and claw, and he slid under a giant man-stork’s strides. He paused every now then to make sure that insatiable threads which snuck by Moto’s flailing knife were cut away. 
They ran and ran, and all the while, Mandri was losing his sense of bliss. Fear crept in between heavy breaths—not fear of demons, he could avoid them easily. Fear of something else. Something much deeper. Something that he’d swallowed.</Text>
            <Notes>Pell has cut away all her purpose.

—for dying is no great sacrifice, no, Schisol will live, He’ll live for all eternity alone, weeping, just to protect against the chance of His brother rising up and starting it all over again.”

GRAB GOLDEN BLADE

“Because he is gaburshegee. He is infertile ground. He denies everyone else’s plans for his life. No one in the world can tell him what to do. Only, there’s one more person he must reject.”
“You?” Mandri asked.
“Yourself.”

Scintilla of doubt

You deny everyone else’s plans, 

That’s a map of the balkans. It always repays inspection

It was a ___ of bird and beast and fishy-freak feast.


Moto, who’d taken up responsibility for the rear of their little file, mumbled a prayer and kept on marching, and when Mandri lost sight of light of the man’s torch, he dared a whisper to Obo, who still sat in his pack.
“Obo,” he said.
“What?”
“What do you know about Shis?”
“There are too many conflicting stories,” Obo said.</Notes>

            <Text>On the sixth day, or was it the seventh? On the seventh day, they crossed a charnel road, and on the other side of it was a small rock cairn splattered with white paint. This marked the grave of a pilgrim. An epitaph had been written on a stick of wood and stuck in the ground right next to it, but this had been scoured into illegibility.
No one knew which shrine the charnel road led to, or from which city the road began. Somehow, in the quest to reason it out, Obo offended Purl by telling her she was too kind. 
“It’s a good thing,” he said to her as she scowled back. “By the way, that’s the reason you won’t be able to control me, not completely. A Minder has to have a cruel disposition. You have to want to hurt people.”
“I’ve killed people.”
“I doubt you were cruel about it. You don’t hate deeply. Or perhaps you hate too deeply.”
Obo’s words seemed to strike a chord in Purl, but she turned away and said, “I don’t care what you think.”</Text>

            <Title>Pile Of Dead</Title>
            <Text>A long year ago, Mandrameen decided to quit painting. In the weeks leading up to that moment, he’d laze the days away in the halls of a lesser member of the guild of Lords, a governor named Eruhd. Mandri drank the prince’s wine, stuffed his face with peach chicken potstickers and prickled lizard pluck, all the while admiring the paintings of the Lady Fremell.
Mandri liked Fremell’s work. She had no equal—surpassed by many, yes, but no true equal. She was decent. She was a painter’s painter, and that meant that the subtleties of her brush were completely lost on the Hrkan elite and her tremendous talent went largely overlooked. Mandri saw in her a kindred spirit, and he was inspired by almost everything she did and that included how she died—she killed herself by jumping from a balcony that overlooked the sea.
Mandri had scribbled a few compositions of that moment, the moment just before the jump. The lady standing on a white stone banister, her waist-length hair wind-blown against her figure, hugging her, when nobody else would. Unfortunately, Mandri could never find someone who was willing to put up the funds for the finished piece.
On one of those lazy days spent idling around in the prince’s halls, Mandri saw a curious and rare sight—one of the twelve Hrkan Lords was admiring Fremell’s paintings. The old man stopped to contemplate each piece, a curious sight because this Lord was the Lord Gagan, a rough and tumble fellow who’d clearly risen up from the lower rumble of the guild of Lords, a battle hardened fanatic who looked more likely to chew on the canvas than admire its deft use of color. He wasn’t the usual foppish wimp that makes a show of art appreciation. And Lord Gagan struck his most thoughtful pose before Fremell’s greatest work, a painting titled, “The Shadow of the Goriol Valley”.
Mandri’s opinion of the painting was that the painting was a work of meager genius—meager genius, because Mandri could not admit anyone as a true genius. The painting was good. It was a view from the low Goriol Valley trail, looking up at the ridge line which sheltered the valley from the eastern winds. The sun was setting behind that ridge, so most of the scene was covered in shadow—blues, purples and muddy grays that seemed almost burnt when nestled against the cooler hues. Near the bottom, in the middle distance, was a sinuous, slow flowing creek. Its water was blood red. That’s the first thing the viewer sees as one walks towards the painting from afar, for not only is the creek spotlighted by the sun peeking over the ridge, but the composition is structured in such a way that the eye is drawn to a stepping-stone waterfall that’s set on a golden third. Below this waterfall, bobbing in its pool, is a brown lump of something strange. Step a little closer to the painting and it becomes clear that this lump is a face-down, lifeless body. The water isn’t just blood-red, stained as such by clay or vegetable matter, it is literally blood, for the shadowed valley slope above is carpeted in human corpses.
One almost has to squint to see the bodies, but they are there, soldiers all, brown bodies folded and crumpled on top of each other like a storm from the Abari highlands had ripped through the valley and dumped them there. 
Lord Gagan said, “I think this is the worst painting ever made.” 
No doubt the Lord had seen a mound of bodies before. Probably, he’d ordered them made. Perhaps the Lord was suggesting that Fremell should have painted fruit and flowers instead, because such a sheltered woman could not possibly capture the greater meaning that a well bloated body presented when it was piled on top of twenty others. Mandri had never seen a pile of the battle dead, and he always assumed that he never would. He would never know if the Lord’s chiding remark had merit. Then the battle of Minting Rock happened and a good seventy something Hrkans died, nine Ayramun as well. When the fighting was finished, Ayram directed whoever was left to gather up the dead, Hrk and Outland alike, and put them in a pile. 
They were to be piled into the shape of a sphere. Mandri was not told why it should be a sphere instead of a regular old pile, nonetheless, that was the order. And because a pile of bodies does not naturally take a sphere’s shape, Mandri was conscripted to construct a large bowl out of Minting Rock’s rubble. Mandri spent the afternoon building that giant bowl, and he did a terrible job, on account of the hobble in his leg and his general desire to be useless. When the bodies were tossed in, they didn’t make a sphere, they made a regular old lump. Thankfully, no one seemed to care, as an effort had been made and an effort was enough. Mandri supposed everyone was too exhausted to be angry. And it wasn’t only the enemy they were handling, it was their own friends as well, so the mood was grim. There were also those desiccated giants, the ones that had been tucked away inside of Minting Rock’s tombs for who knows how many centuries. In the collapse they’d split apart like twigs and whatever was found of them was tossed on top of the pile like kindling.
By twilight the grim deed was finished, and Mandri was allowed to creep away and rest against a heap of rocks. There he sat, alone, munching on some Hrkan hardtack, and his thoughts turned to that painting of the Goriol Valley and the Lord Gagan’s chiding critique.
This pile of dead did not resemble what Fremell had painted. There was significantly more blood in Fremell’s vision, and Fremell’s dead bodies were more seductive, though that was just how people were painted, living or dead. Her bodies were well-muscled and well-naked, or half-naked, and they looked like they’d just stepped out of a bath instead of choking each-other in the sand. It was a typical dramatic device—the perfection of youth cut down before their time—but Fremell’s message went further than that, for Fremell came from a school of artists who thought they had important things to say. Fremell’s painting was a commentary on man’s abiding concupiscence, for what is war but a perversion of lust and desire?
Fremell’s battlefield lay strewn with naked men lying upon naked men. They had all come down from their passionate trance, where reason gave way to baser instinct, where they wrestled, where their limbs tangled and their weapons, phallic, penetrating, stabbed into slits that bled. It was all quite pointed and homoerotic, with eyes rolled back, jaws slack, because ecstasy and death often looked the same and so did war and sex—if one side isn’t satisfied, perhaps they go at it again until everyone is utterly spent.
Mandri surveyed the rubble of Minting Rock, as well as his own memory of what had transpired, and there wasn’t a lick of sexual energy in any of it. There’d been excitement, yes, but that did not last long. Whatever relief there was, was firmly put to bed as soon as the bodies of the dead were tallied.
Forty’s body could not be found, and that set the mood of the Ayramun careening into a fog of gloom. She had been well-liked. Seb had seen her jump into the fray, before the collapse, and that meant she was entombed in the bottom of Minting Rock’s central well.
Chopper’s death was unnecessary. He’d lived through the collapse, but in a fit of chop-lust he sprinted towards a Hrkan soldier and was walloped by Ayram’s spear. Ayram was not forthcoming about precisely how it occurred, all he said was, “The idiot got in the way”. But Chopper’s body told the story—his sternum was cracked, and his lips were stained by his own blood, for he’d died choking on it.
Bush-headed Tob had been unlucky. He’d survived the first half of Minting Rock splitting off, but from the way that Moto told it, the second half’s collapse sent a leg-sized shard of stone whistling down in Tob’s direction. If Tob had been standing a step to either side, he would have survived.
The old witch Elrahet survived, as old witches always do. She was busy mumbling some witchy incantations as she laid her hands on the pile of dead. Purl was beside her, managing a meager flame that illuminated nothing but her handless arm as she tried, pitifully, to shield it from the wind. The rest of the surviving Ayramun—Ayram, Seb, Moto, and Moteah—kept themselves busy trying to salvage what they could from the destruction. They’d already looted the dead for anything useful, mostly foodstuffs—the Hrks had brought plenty of hardtack with them, and it was all wrapped neatly in crinkly brown-leaf squares, each stamped with the sigil of Hrk.
The only thing Mandri took for himself was a pair of leather pouches tied together by a stiff gut cord—it was Tob’s collection of rocks, one sack filled with luck, the other filled with bad luck, maybe ten pebbles apiece. Mandri had plucked them out of the dead man’s robes because those rocks were Tob’s life’s work and Mandri respected the effort. He half-believed the rocks were charmed, because if a person can be lucky then why not a rock? And the pouches were more than just the rocks inside them. They were the kind of thing Fremell might paint to get her message across. She might have put them hanging off the hip of a foreground figure to let everyone know this particular man was manlier than the rest. Mandri dangled them about and wondered why he never noticed this kind of thing unless it was in a painting. In life, pouches were merely pouches—in a painting they’re a token of testicular virility. Tob had been walking around with these pouches for who knows how long and not once did Mandri point and laugh.
“It’s all bullshit,” Mandri muttered. He was referring, of course, to everything—his leg, his skin sticky from sweat, Fremell’s attempt to impress the world, and the Ayramun, too, because all their friends had just been slaughtered and they were already moving on. They were glum, sure, but it didn’t feel like that was enough. Not a watery eye in sight when someone should be wailing. Poor Chopper. Poor Tob.
And Obo was gone. He was the only one of them willing to speak to Mandri on even terms.
Unfortunate.
Mandri thought about humming a song for Obo. Obo wasn’t human and he didn’t have a Spark, but he was deserving of a song, and if not a song, at least something more than a mere remembrance.
Mandri groaned against the thought that he shouldn’t even be here. He should be back in Meskalem, laying in his field getting high on burgeons.
High as the uglies on a too-tall horse.
Folks in Eez call it tickleberried.
All he had to show for his many travails was two pouches of charmed rocks and a wafer of brown Hrkan hardtack. 
Mandri looked down in his lap and pulled one of the lucky stones out. It was quite striking, for a stone, for it was two completely different stones, one half beige, the other chalk-white, which had somehow fused together to become one.
Seb had been idling nearby like a dried out lizard. He said, “You know thems only rocks, right?” 
Mandri replied, “I’ve cheated death about five times in the past four days, so I’m starting to think that luck is real.”
“No such thing as cheatin’ death,” Seb said. He spat a wad of the thick goo into the sand, then added,  “If there is, everyone been cheatin’ death every moment of their lives. Shit, since you been sittin’ there you breathed ‘bout a hundred times—that’s a hundred deaths you just put off, but I don’t see you thankin’ luck for the miracle.”
“Breathing is not a miracle.”
“Tell that to folks that can’t breathe. Friend of mine once died when he was sleepin’. Wasp flew straight in his open mouth and stung him in the dangly bit. Thing swole up the size of my uglies.”
“Sounds horrible.”
“An it could happen to you. Could happen any given moment, but I don’t see you prostratin’ yourself every second, thankin’ luck for keepin’ the damn wasps from uggin’ up your throat.”
“Well, in case it’s necessary, I will give thanks.” Mandri opened his arms to the reddening sun and said, “I thank you Luck for keeping the wasps off me!”
Seb snorted and smirked. He appreciated the sarcasm.
“No one’s special,” he said. “Everybody is who they be and that’s all they is.”
“I don’t disagree.”
“Wouldn’t matter if you did. The gods are playin’ a game an’ that’s all there is to it. An’ you best believe me—‘cause you might catch sight of the hand of Solraheen, and you best be ready.”
“Right,” said Mandri, flippantly. “The last time I heard someone talk about Solraheen’s hand, it was from a priest getting his head chopped off.”
“What’s a priest losing his head got to do with it?”
“He was arrested for stealing the legs of the Lybion martyrs from the temple of Jeetz.”
“Horseshit. Them legs are as watched as the sun.”
“That’s why they caught him and put him on trial. And you know what he said in his defense? He said the hand of Solraheen directed him. He said if Solraheen didn’t want him to have such sacred relics, then Solraheen wouldn’t have allowed the theft to occur in the first place.”
“And he were right.”
“The judge said that if Solraheen wanted that priest to keep his head, Solraheen wouldn’t have allowed the man to be caught.”
Seb nodded without appreciating the of irony. “That’s how it is.”
They both sat there, staring at the mound of bodies, Seb in wistful repose, and Mandri leaning away, trying not to sniff Seb’s smell. The man was still as dirty as when that Hrkan soldier had pulled him out of the sand. He was as comfortable in that skin as a dog who’d been rolling around in mud.
Eventually, Seb stood up and said, “Come on.” He brushed off his ass, as if that would do anything to wipe away the absolute filth that covered him. “I been lookin’ for the Mazid’s body all day, an’ now that you're free, you’re gonna help me find it.”
“Why?”
“Because that’s what Ayram told me to do, an’ now that’s what I’m tellin’ you to do. Let’s test your luck, maybe you find him before me.”
Seb and Mandri spent the next hand and a half looking for Obo's body. They had no luck until Mandri got tired of looking and decided to apply himself. He realized that if he’d been thrown clear of the destruction, then Obo probably had as well. From there they checked around where Mandri landed, and sure enough, there was Obo, still swaddled in black, his head and shoulders buried in the sand like he were an arrow loosed from a heavenly bow. Seb didn’t want to touch Obo, so Mandri pulled him out alone, though this didn’t require much effort. Mandri found himself hoping that he’d feel Obo wiggle back to life once shaken, but no, he was as lifeless as any of the other bodies, and nearly weightless in comparison. And his skin was much paler, even by Obo’s standards.
At Seb’s urging, Mandri carried the little torso of a Mazid back to the makeshift camp in the middle of Minting Rock’s rubble, for that is where Ayram sat.
The giant had his broad back turned, uncovered, and he was sitting on wooden stool that had been scavenged from wreckage. The witch Elrahet was checking this incredible wall of flesh for wounds. The stool squeaked and groaned every time Ayram shifted his weight, but he was perfectly silent as the old witch sewed up a thin gash that wrapped around his side. As she worked, she washed away the sand from his skin with a wet rag. His was a tightly sculpted body, animal skinny and strong. Each time Ayram lifted his arm to give Elrahet clearance to scrub, the striations in his shoulders popped and his shoulder blade melted into a pool of rippling muscle.
“Seb, you soilbucket!” the giant shouted when he noticed Seb approaching. “Did you find it?” 
Seb ducked under the words with a reverent bow. “When did I never do what I said I was gonna do?”
“Good.”
“Put it over there,” Elrahet snapped as she pointed with her elbow.
Laying on the ground nearby was the Mazidariga child, dead. Mandri laid Obo down next to it. Both were swaddled in black, with only their faces open to the air. They looked oddly like siblings—their skin had that same cloudy pallor. Obo was the bigger of the two, or he would have been if he hadn’t been quartered.
Ayram sighed and his shoulders slumped. Then he slapped his knees and he stood up, against Elrahet’s protestations. He twisted back and forth to test the stitchwork that riddled his side, and when this sent a thin stream of blood dribbling down his ribs, he ripped a long, thin strip of wool from a white Hrkan cloak and bandaged himself up. While he was tying the knot, he pointed with his chin towards twin corpses, Obo and the Riga.
“Let’s do it,” he said.
Elrahet grumbled, then waddled over to the corpses and shooed Seb and Mandri aside. She then straightened the bodies out so that they lay flat on their backs, bellies even, and she knelt in between their heads, making sure the skirt of her robe folded nicely to make a pillow for her creaky knees. 
From nowhere, a golden blade flashed in her hands, shining bright in the light of the sun. The sight of it turned Mandri’s stomach, for he’d seen one like it flash a slit of red into his ox’s throat. In fact, if his memory served, the two blades were exactly alike. Elrahet carried the same blade that the demon witch Pell had used to turn his world inside out.
Elrahet hadn’t yet sprouted fangs, and she didn’t fly around as if possessed by the wind, but Mandri began to suspect there was some devilish air about her which he hadn’t noticed before.
Elrahet’s head craned towards the sky, and the speech that ushered from her throat was so polluted with guttural urks that Mandri wondered if they were even words. Not even the croaks of vomiting toads sounded so much like her gibberish. As the witch croaked, her words pulled a shimmering, red smoke out from her throat. This smoke wisped and curled like smoke from a candle’s flame, and it followed the direction of her words as if buffeted by them, and it settled around the tip of her golden blade. When the blade was fully sheathed in the red misty, Elrahet slammed it down into Riga child’s belly, burying it up to the hilt.
The Riga child’s eyes flicked open and bulged as if trying to escape its skull, one red eye twisting left, the other twisting right. Mandri wondered if its brain might be exploding, and then Riga’s whole body juddered, its legs spasmed. Elrahet pushed down on the Riga’s hips with her free hand to steady the creature, and when the jerking finally settled down, Elrahet ripped the blade from the stomach, bent over the wound, then set her lips upon it.
Every fiber of Mandri’s being wanted to look away from this unholy sight, but he couldn’t—such is the allure of dark and twisted things. The Riga wasn’t human, but it looked enough like an innocent child that Mandri felt shame for staring, and he nearly fainted when the witch slurped up blood from the hole in the Riga’s belly. 
Elrahet pulled her head away from the Riga’s corpse, mouth shut tight, withered lips painted red, and she swung around to kiss the lips of Obo. But of course, it was more crude than that—she squeezed Obo’s jaw open, and spit the contents of her mouth into Obo’s throat—mostly blood and chunks of viscera, but along with it came a formless gray light, the same light that Mandri had seen zip out of Obo’s body back in Minting Rock.
Elrahet shut Obo’s jaw, clenched it tight with her leathery palm, and set to whispering that guttural language into Obo’s ear. Next she whispered to his throat, then to his chest, as if beckoning the pseudospark along to finally come to a rest back in Obo’s stomach. When she was finished, she set her ear to Obo’s heart, closed her eyes, and listened. 
A stillness settled over those gathered as they waited for something magical to happen.
“Fetch Purl!” Elrahet snipped. “Quick!”
Mandri winced when Ayram barked the name with a force that could shake loose a star.
“PURL!”
A heartbeat later, and Purl came running into the clearing, yelling, “What is it?” She took one look at Elrahet hovering over Obo and understood.
She hurried over and knelt next to Obo’s body, and took a deep breath to compose herself.
“Squeeze the hand,” said Elrahet, and she held up her own bony claw of a hand to demonstrate, clutching some invisible stone, was pumping it with her fist.
Purl held up her handless arm and focused. The wound which had looked so severe only days ago was already free of bandages. The fresh pink skin which splotched the nub of her wrist looked diseased against her natural mocha color. She, and everyone else, was staring at it. All of them imagined her severed hand inside Obo’s chest, squeezing with invisible might. 
Obo’s ribcage thumped.
Sweat beaded on Purl’s brow. 
“Harder,” griped Elrahet.
Purl’s determination deepened, such that she was no longer breathing. Just when it seemed that she would faint, Obo opened his eyes. 
“Sol’s light,” Elrahet muttered to the sky. “I thought it faded.”
Purl sat back into her heels and heaved a sigh of relief.
Bleary-eyed Obo slowly glanced around, took in Ayram’s blood spattered visage, saw the black rubble of Minting Rock around him, and squinted at the pile bodies. His senses were recovering with startling speed. When he turned his head and saw Mandri, his lips crumpled into a weak smile, broken when Ayram’s great paw gripped Obo’s whole head and lifted the Mazid up to lean him against a rock.
Then Ayram turned to Purl and said, “Make it do something.”
“Do what?”
“Make it hiss like a lizard.”
Purl, still kneeling, recomposed herself. She waited until Obo’s eyes were alert and staring back at her, and then she issued a tight-lipped command.
“Hiss,” she said, “Like a lizard.”
Obo smiled, and simply said the word, “Hiss.”
“Did you make him do that?” Ayram asked Purl with a skeptical eye.
“I think so.”
 He asked Obo.“Did she make you do that?”
“I am not sure how to answer that.”
“Answer with the truth.”
“The truth is that if the girl didn’t tell me to hiss like a lizard, I never would have said hiss.”
Elrahet grumbled again. “We don’t have time for this.”
“Speak plainly,” Ayram demanded.
Obo shrugged and said, “The girl’s command was not sufficient cause to compel me to speak.”
Ayram turned again to Purl, frustration tilting his voice. “Make it do something by thinking it.”
Mandri watched with bated breath as Purl whistled out her own through pursed lips. She could, at least, compose herself under pressure. She drew upon her unseen strength, and she dipped into some altered state, eyes rolling back, lips mumbling, and suddenly there was a north-easterly breeze which was not there before.
She reached out with her handless arm again. Her nose wrinkled and Obo’s bald head twitched. When Purl’s glare went wild, Obo’s shoulders crimped and a faint golden glow began to shine through the skin of his throat. He opened his mouth towards the heavens, and Mandri expected to see a blast of Mazidfire issue forth—everyone did—but nothing came. Soon the wind was dead and Purl was back inside her own skin with nothing to show for it.
“Interesting,” said Obo, impressed. “You almost did it.”
“That’s good enough for now,” said Ayram.
“Is it?” Obo asked.
“It is.”
“I know you won’t believe me, but the girl will never be able to control me. Even if she could, there’s still the issue of the Mazidariga.”
“He’s right,” said Seb, who was crouching nearby like a sandrat waiting for someone to drop a crumb of bread. Ayram silenced the man with a sideways glance, and asked, “How many Mazidariga are there?”
“I don’t know,” Obo answered. “But there is a peaceable solution to that particular problem which I’m sure you’ll find agreeable.”
“Out with it.”
“First, I need to know what it is you want me to do. Why did you take me captive? Do you want me to drive Hrk’s armies into the sea? Lay waste to every Hrkan temple? Kill every member of the guild of Lords?”
“There’s no use in telling,” Elrahet grumbled again.
Obo was quick to counter her. “I don’t think that’s true,” he said enthusiastically. “You see, I would welcome a change in the continent’s leadership. The guild of Lords is weak and fractious. They create more problems than they solve.”
“We can’t trust the creature,” said Elrahet brusquely.
“We don’t need to,” said Ayram. “Either it says something sensible, or we ignore it.” He leaned on his spear and asked intently,  “Now how do we elude those Mazidariga children?”
“Before I get to that, please, stop and consider—what is the one thing the Hrkan Lords are scared of?”
“The Mazidai?” Elrahet grouched.
“Yes, but no. You see, I was made to help manage that one thing that checks the Hrkan Lords—that is the Hrkan people. You may think that I was made to terrorize you, but the Lords don’t care about the outland tribes. You’re tangential. In fact, they’ve sympathy for you if you can believe it. The guild is the only thing holding the common folk back from stealing what arable lands you people have left. If you your goal is to plunge Hrk into chaos, you’ll be signing your own writ of doom.”
Ayram chuckled and shook his head. “I know what the Hrkan people are capable of.”
“Then why agitate them?” Obo asked. The force of his argument was working an energy into him. If his arms were able to move underneath his swaddling robe, they would have been going mad. “If you want Hrk to fall cleanly, you have to be precise. You needn’t a Mazid to do this. Kill but a few choice men and women, the ones keeping the corruption in check—as well as a few others who bridge the natural divisions within the nation. Apply some pressure to the right places, and Hrk will fall apart under its own weight, and it would be a more manageable decline. It might take some time, but believe me, Hrk hates itself more than it hates you. Simply get them to no longer want to be a nation, and they won’t be. That will give the outland tribes room to breathe.”
“You speak as if you have experience tearing down kingdoms.”
“How do you think Hrk tore down the Old Jandri world? It wasn’t Mazidfire. Disagreement is a natural impulse for your kind, and if you prey on that, a nation spirals into a cycle of death that feeds itself as soon as first blood is drawn.”
“The thing you don’t understand,” said Ayram, “Is that I don’t care about Hrk. I don’t even care about the outland tribes. What I do care about is killing an Amalgamete.”
“A what?”
“An Amalgamete. A god-swallower. The demon of demons.”
Obo looked deeply into Ayram’s eyes, as if to gauge the man’s sincerity. Mandri, in turn, looked to each of the Ayramun and they were each as clear-eyed and as firm as their leader, well, all except Seb. It’s difficult to know how much dimwittery is inside someone’s head at a glance, but Seb was an exception to that rule because it was dripping from his lip. For Mandri’s part, he was alarmed. He’d never heard of a god-swallower before.
“I don’t understand,” said Obo, stealing the words right out of Mandri’s mind. “If there’s a demon running around, why not let Hrk deal with it?”
Elrahet snapped, “We don’t have time for this!”
Ayram shrugged off his witch and said, “I would not trust Hrk with a .”
Obo was squirming inside his black swaddling robe. If his confusion was a performance, it was a convincing one. “You  went through all this, because you need me to kill a demon?”
Ayram nodded. “A big one.”
“Why not poke it with your spear?”
“It’s a very big one.”
Obo was struggling to come to terms with this news. His smooth dimpled up ob , and this much, Mandri was sure, was not an act. Obo finally asked, “How big is this Amalgamete?”
Ayram slid a side-smile at Elrahet, who returned another testy grunt.
Ayram said, “Let’s not worry about that right now. What we need to do is avoid the Mazidariga.” 
“Well that’s simple,” said Obo. “You can avoid the Riga by giving me a Spark.” He mounted his argument before anyone had time to laugh, and added, “One distant whistle from a Mazidariga will suck the pseudospark from my body, rendering me inert. If I had my own shard of the divine, then it stands to reason that I would be freed from the Mazidariga’s influence entirely, free from its hunt.”
“And you’d be freed from your Minder as well.”
“Yes, but if you give me a Spark, you would be giving me my freedom, and with it I could breath Mazidfire on my own. No Minder would be necessary. In return for your gift, I would slay anything you wished.”
“Hah!”Ayram exclaimed as he rubbed his beard, clearly amused with Obo’s sudden turn. He glanced towards his band and declared, “They breed them selfish, don’t they?”
“Wanting a Spark is selfish?”
Ayram chuckled and then paused to give Obo’s suggestion some consideration. He said, “I don’t even know if it’s possible.”
“What about Mandri?” Obo asked. “I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into his body. I did not believe such a thing was possible, yet here he is. If you could infuse Mandri’s corpse with a Spark which was not his own, then do the same for me.”
Ayram eyed Elrahet and asked, “Can this be done?”
Elrahet was standing as still as scarecrow, staring at Obo, her old joints seemingly stuck as the layers of black tatters draped on her leathery bones drifted against the breeze. She said, “A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require an act of creation.”
Ayram shrugged and mused, “If it can’t be done.”
Elrahet growled, and her hand twisted tight on her cane as she said, “I did not say it could not be done.”
Mandri’s ears pricked up, and the old witch seemed to grow a foot in his eyes as she waddled over to Obo and loomed over his diminutive form.
She said, “Tell me, creature, if you had a Spark, what would stop you from killing us? What would stop you from going back on your word?”
“Nothing,” Obo admitted.
“You see!?” she shrieked. “We can’t trust the creature! We’re better off stumbling blind into a nest of battles.”
Ayram smirked and said, “Damned will be the day that I trust the Mazid to honor words. We’ll make do without its wisdom.”
He then gathered up his spear and said, “Make ready to leave. We’ll just have to outpace the Hrks.”
“Leave to where?” Obo asked.
“We make for the bones of Bullr, and then to Shulgi.”
Obo was unimpressed. “The Bullr basin is surrounded by Hrkan posts. If there was any great demon dwelling there, it would have been noticed.”
“The demon isn’t in the bones, it’s in Shulgi.”
“And where is that?”
Ayram grinned under his bloody bush of a beard and said, “This may surprise you, Mazid, but the Sand is full of terrors beyond your ken.”</Text>

            <Title>Salt Farm</Title>
            <Text>Two years ago, Mandri sold what little he owned and bought a farm ten miles outside of Meskalim. Gil, he’d rescued from a leech farm. The poor old ox had been tied into a box that kept him still while the leeches fed on him. It was a horrible thing. Two wooden bars were under his legs to keep him standing or else he’d have collapsed into the swamp from pain and exhaustion.
Mandri tried growing burgeon bushes, but his land was not good for it. It wasn’t good for anything because when he bought the place the dirt was already worn out. He didn’t know that at the time because he didn’t know anything about farming. The first few plantings were fine, but after that, any time a strong rain came it sucked the salt up out of the ground and it all pooled on the surface, so that his field looked like a sweaty brown salt-stained tunic that had been left to dry out in the sun.
The only thing that would grow was a solitary hornscrub tree. It grew right smack-dab in the middle of the field. The tree’s shade was the only place to laze the days away, and lazing there meant Mandri and Gil would have to look upon the dead earth and scattered stalks of failure. 
It was no matter, though. Peace of mind could be bought for the price of a burgeon.
Mandri found that if he mixed the burgeon’s juice into a milky-white barley beer that he’d left steeping in a hole in the ground, well, two mouthfuls of that and every worry melted away. 
He took one mouthful because he wanted to ease into it.
It was a beautiful sunny day. There was even a breeze, and the sound of a cool breeze sifting through the boughs of his hornscrub tree was pleasing.
It’s not something that can be captured by a painting.
In truth, nothing can.
Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed.
The problem was always the same—art is misdirection, it diverts attention away from what is truly there to what the artist wants the audience to see. The artist boils reality down into something digestible. They boil it down to a single tangible lump of something which has them transfixed—a flower, a pretty face, or some redemptive story. What matters is that they try to preserve the things that make life worth living by ripping them out of the rest of reality and stitching their hides to a frame. Then, after having captured and killed the sublime, they sell it.
And that’s the fact of it.
Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed.
Every. Single. One.
Mandri burped, and took another swig of his burgeon beer.
It was hard not to think about painting.
What a cruel thing to do to Nature.
Paint an oasis, and in so doing he’d be forced to reduce a palm leaf to a fleck of green. The beauty of a living leaf—its complexity, its pattern, its anastomosing veins pumped full of vital fluids, its birth and death and eventual decay, the role it plays on the branch, the branch on the tree, the system within a system, a whole universe unto itself nested inside a greater one—all that complexity, that beauty, reduced to a fleck of green.
Reduced, because again, the artist has something more important he wants you to look at. There’s a naked woman bathing in the mossy water. There’s no need to properly render the leaf. In fact, rendering that leaf, giving it light and shadow and form, that would only distract the eye from the droplets of jade gleaming on her cinnamon skin. The sensible thing to do, if he had to paint the leaf, was to slightly feather its edge into the sky so that eye doesn’t get caught on a hard line of verdant green set against a chalky blue. He might remove the leaf and the tree altogether if the thing doesn’t slide a wandering eye down towards the temptress’ bosom. And then he’d really done it, he’d not only reduced the leaf down to a daub of color, he’d erased it from existence entirely.
Maybe someone could say that he wasn’t trying to paint Nature, he was trying to paint a woman, and so of course he wouldn’t capture Nature’s essence, but that hardly matters. “Go and try and paint Nature,” Mandri said to Gil as his ox napped the noon away. “Take as long as you like. Take a lifetime. Take ten lifetimes! Then… and then…”
And then he forgot what he was on about because hairs on Gil’s hide were starting to swirl. They only swirled a little bit. A more intense, boiling swirl was something that only happens when Mandri took black-eye burgeons, and only then if he picked them fresh and got to their juice before it was ever exposed to the air.
Down-valley burgeon beer, the kind which he was drinking, does something entirely different. Things will swirl, edges will bleed, but only a little. The chief effect was that anything bright would sparkle—Gil’s stubby white horns, the sunlight on the dusty earth, the puffs of cloud in the sky, pretty much everything that wasn’t hidden in shadow would sparkle. Most interestingly, the burgeonsight made it look like the salt stain on his field was squirming around. That was always a delight because it made it feel like he hadn’t lost a battle to an inanimate thing, that the salt was alive, a flood of wriggling white mites gnawing at the few decaying plants.
At least he’d managed to feed something.
He nestled deeper into the tree trunk’s embrace, and he sighed a little half-sipped, absent sigh, the kind of sigh that he’d start to make whenever he was ready for a nap. He let his eyelids slouch as he watched the flies buzz in and out of Gil’s snout. The ox would snore and blow those fuzzy black dots out of his great big nostrils, and then those flies would zip back in to lick at the only reliable source of moisture that they could find in this godforsaken field.
“Are you Mandrameen?”
Burgeon beer had never given Mandri an extra inner voice before. Odd that it should sound like an old hag. It was an unwelcome development. He did not want to pursue it.  He wanted to sleep.
“Go away,” he said.
But it didn’t go away. It kicked him in the shin.
“Ow!”
The pain pricked Mandri’s mind back into the moment. He opened his eyes and was stunned to see an old witchy woman wrapped in black standing there before him.
He’d heard of burgeonsight granting visions, but it had never happened to him. He tried to blink the old woman away, but she was a stubborn vision. He picked up a little pebble and threw it at her. 
It hit her square on the nose.
“Ack!”
She wasn’t ready for it. Her arms flew up in a billow of black robe, and she staggered back a step.
She was real.
Mandri’s first instinct was to drink as much of his jumped-up beer as he could, because no doubt this hag would try to steal it.
Then again, she might not know what it was. It looked like milk. And it would be a waste to drink it all in one go—it would knock him out, and what was the point of that? No, that wouldn’t do. This was a special drink. He’d made plenty of special drinks, but this one was extra special because it was right here, a thing of the present. He could maybe try to hide it, tuck the clay jug away somewhere, maybe just nudge it behind the tree, but no doubt that harpy’s eyes were—
“Something wrong with you, boy?” 
The woman’s voice was dire. She stared him down, and Mandri peered into the shadow of her blue-and-black shawl. He couldn’t find her eyes behind a nasty squint and a nose that was impossible to reason with. She wasn’t too old, just sun-leathered, and dammit she was tall. Too tall for an old woman. That was man’s air she was breathing.
“I’ll ask again, are you Mandrameen?”
She must be strong too, because her back bore a large canvas sack. Nearly doubled her size. And she hadn’t come adorned with the usual veneer of civilization—no shine-black bracelets, or bangles, or silver hoop earrings, no makeup or red-thread leaves trimming her robe. The only ornament she carried was a turtle-shell comb that she kept fashionably crooked in her waistband. The rest of her tawny self seemed slapped together in a reed hut on the banks of the Jek river. She was a feral thing, dirty with perfect teeth, all of them perfectly straight and sun-bleached. The burgeonsight made them sparkle. They practically outshone the sun.
She kicked his shin again.
“Ow!” Mandri moaned. “Dammit, yes, I’m Mandri.”
“Do you still have your testicles?” 
Her teeth flashed as she spoke. Her head pitched into a suspecting tilt. “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
Mandri shook his head in disbelief.
“Just because I don’t go in for the haggard women of Meskalim, that doesn’t make me a—what are you on about anyways?”
“Answer my question.”
“Of course I have my—hold on, who are you?”
“You have your testicles,?”
“Yes.”
“You’re not lying?”
“Did Lora send you?”
The woman unshouldered her heavy pack. It hit the ground with a dull thump, and this disturbed Gil, who raised his heavy head. The ox saw the woman, gave a snort, then promptly went back to sleep. 
Without asking if Mandri minded, the woman sat down upon her pack. She sat down right in front of his feet. Then she pulled from her ragged robe a brown paper booklet. This booklet had no cover, and its makeshift spine was composed of peeling wax and fraying twine.
She laid the booklet flat on her lap and flipped through a few pages. There weren’t many of them. Mandri craned his neck to see if he could read what was there, but the burgeonsight made that impossible. Edges were starting to bleed together. If he drank too much more, things might get screwy.
“So, you are Mandrameen,” the woman said as she flattened an unruly page with her palm.
“And who are you?” Mandri asked. This time he was more demanding.
“I am Pell,” she said.
“Go away, Pell.”
Pell smirked. She said, “I’m going to ask a few questions, and then I’ll be on my way.”
Mandri took another swig of beer. He tried to reason out why she was here. By the looks of her, she didn’t have any money, so if it was about money, she was here to take it. If that little book of hers was a book of debts, well, Mandri would not be able to pay up.
“Where are you from, Pell?”
“I come from that which everything comes—the all-white Spark.”
“Oh, you’re one of those.”
“And what is that?”
“An itinerant priest.”
“Priestess,” Pell corrected. “My god is—”
“The gods are all dead,” said Mandri, interrupting.
“Not my god. I serve the Amalgamete.”
“Never heard of him.”
“I would be a poor servant if you had.”
“Well…good. Keep it to yourself.”
Pell gave a bemused sigh and flipped through her pages. “You’re drooling,” she said disdainfully. 
Mandri wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Burgeons can make a mess of a person, but he wasn’t so far gone yet. A peculiar thing about this particular brew was that it left his wits untouched. Well, mostly untouched. Maybe a little touched. Toddler touched. Honestly, Mandri wasn’t sure. He knew it wasn’t safe to reason about reason when burgeons were involved.
Mandri said, “I’ve never seen a priest without a pound of gold or silver rattling around his neck.”
“Me and mine are struggling at the moment.”
“Then your god must not be a very strong god.”
“Oh, but He is getting stronger by the day.”
“How is that?”
“He grows as anyone does, he eats. He eats and grows stronger. He is going to—Ah, here you are. Mandrameen Andramawmun. That is your full name?”
Pell underlined his name with her finger.
Mandri nodded.
“You have a good name,” Pell said. “A strong Jandri name. An Old Jandri name. That’s good. And my notes say you started learning how to paint at the age of five. Is that right?”
Mandri’s eyes narrowed. If this woman was looking for an artist for some backwater temple icon, she’d come to the wrong place. Unless she had money.
“Do you have money?” he asked.
Pell either didn’t hear him, or pretended not to. She kept on reading from her book.
“My scribblings say you were a decent painter.”
She looked up to gauge Mandri’s reaction. This was some kind of challenge. He would not indulge her, though, high as he was, his face might be doing things all its own. That’s another thing about burgeons—it numbs the face but muscles sometimes keep moving. He could be making kissy lips at her right now and he wouldn’t know it unless he focused.
“It says you have a…” Pell bent down to get a better look at the words. “It says you’ve a triptych hanging in the garden of Zee.”
Mandri nodded. 
“It is hanging inside the garden?”
“Yes.”
“You couldn’t make it into the house?”
Mandri blanched at the insinuation. He said, “You’re a right old hag, aren’t you? You know what? You can leave. I don’t care if you’ve brought money, I’m not going to paint anything for you.”
“I’m not here to commission you.”
Mandri wilted.
“Well, whatever you’re here for, I don’t want it. Leave.”
Pell reached into her robe and pulled out a full silver string of little round coins. They sparkled magnificently.
“You’re in want of money?” she asked.
Mandri’s face must have been doing somersaults because the old woman looked almost frightened of him.
She said, “I will pay you to answer questions.”
“Questions about what?”
“Have you ever heard the word ‘gaburshegee’?”
“I’ve heard of burshegee.”
“Would you consider yourself to be ‘fertile ground’ or ‘infertile ground’?”
“Hold on, I’ve already answered one question.” 
He held out his hand like a beggar.
Pell untied the silver string. She unthreaded a shining disc and tossed it. Despite Mandri’s inebriated state, he snatched the coin out of the air. It was strangely light in his hand, an unfamiliar mint, and he couldn’t parse any of the identifying marks for the burgeonsight blurred it all underneath a smattering of sparkles. It wasn’t a Hrkan coin, anyways.
He said, “What’s this all about, anyways? You’re looking for a eunuch? They’re all in Jeket, aren’t they?”
“It is said that the Amalgamete shall find His strongest champions by planting Sparks in infertile ground. This phrasing is open to interpretation, but I think I know what it means.”
“It means you have to find a bunch of eunuchs?”
“No, I don’t think so, but it never hurts to check. I’m more inclined to believe that I am looking for disaffected artists, but whenever interpretations overlap in the same person, it makes it all the more likely that they are special. You see, the prophecy was written in Old Jandri, using the word ‘gaburshegee’, which means ‘infertile ground’ which can be translated as ‘eunuch’. It can also mean ‘impotent artist’, or ‘useless artist’. It could simply mean ‘infertile ground’. And here you are. I would say that a failed painter who tends a fruitless farm might qualify. Wouldn’t you agree?”
Mandri held out his hand again and said, “Pay in advance.”
“Curb your greed,” Pell said flatly. “I’ve plenty more questions to ask.”
She flipped to another page in her book. Then she flipped right back to where she’d been. 
“I might be skipping things I shouldn’t. Let me make sure…” She fingered a scribble, then read it aloud. “Have you ever prayed to Solraheen?”
“What does that have to do with anything?”
“Answer the question, please. Have you ever prayed to dead god Solraheen?”
“Of course I have, who hasn’t?”
Mandri held out his hand again.
Pell waved it away and said, “But have you spoken the words yourself? I’m not talking about being a part of a prayer circle as a child, where someone else does the heavy lifting. Have you ever run away to a quiet place and whispered words to Solraheen?”
“Who hasn’t?”
“Have you?”
Mandri tried to remember how many questions that made.
“One question at a time,” he said.
Pell cocked her eye, frowned, and scribbled something into her book.
“What’s that you’re writing there?”
Pell looked at him with a sinister eye.
“Can you read?” she asked.
“Of course I can read.”
“Then what does this say?”
She held the book open towards Mandri. The pages were blank.
“It doesn’t say anything.”
Pell tossed three more coins at him, and then she scribbled another secret nothing into her book.
“How many burgeons have you eaten?” she asked.
Mandri held out his greedy hand.
She said, “I’m not paying for that question.”
“I haven’t eaten any burgeons.”
“So you’re a liar?”
“I am not.”
“Hah! You should see your eyes. But that’s good. It’s good.” She jotted down another note. “You’re fitting the mold, Mandrameen. Does that excite you?”
“Are you going to pay for that question?”
“Mandri, if the prospect of becoming one of the Amalgamete’s champions does not excite you, then you’ve a dim Spark indeed.”
She flicked a coin into his lap.
“How do you feel about power over all, eternal life, and infinite pleasure?”
“I’ll take the pleasure,” said Mandri. “Leave the others.”
“Have you ever killed someone before?”
“No.”
“How do you feel about killing people?”
“What has that to do with any of this?”
A flash of annoyance cinched Pell’s weathered features, and she tossed another coin into Mandri’s lap, then repeated her question.
“How do you feel about killing people?”
Mandri didn’t want to answer, but suspected it was the only way to get this old hag to leave. “Killing someone…well, it depends, doesn’t it? The morality of something like that, it depends. Am I killing in self-defense? Are these, I don’t know, murderers?”
“You think that killing someone is a question of morality?”
“Isn’t it?”
“Let me rephrase—How do you feel about people?”
“How do I feel about people?”
The old woman’s squint was getting severe. She asked, “You wouldn’t mind if everyone dropped dead?”
“Did I say that?”
“Stop answering my questions with a question.”
“Look, everybody should be judged on their own merits…What is this prophecy anyways? I do something, and then a lot of people die?” 
“That’s generally how prophecies work—something happens, and a lot of people die.”
“But this prophecy, specifically, what happens?”
“In this prophecy, the Amalgamete’s champions will roam the earth and bring the fractured to His healing hands.”
“What does that have to do with people dying?”
“People are dying all the time. Right this very moment. And I don’t mean one or two, a lot of people are dying right now. All my god is going to do is make sure that everyone is dying for a purpose.”
“And you need me to help him do it?”
“Someone like you. Others as well. Many, if I am successful.”
“Not me?”
“It might be you.”
“Find someone else.”
The old witchy woman laughed. It was a grating laugh, half cackle, half delirious groan.
She said, “That’s not how prophecies work, my dear. I don’t pick someone to play the part. You are who you are, and if you are one of those who is prophesied, then that is that. No one can change it.”
“If no one can change it, then what are you even doing out here, looking around for this prophesied eunuch? You find him, or you don’t find him, it’s all the same.”
Pell sat back on her bag and seemed to cherish the chance to talk about herself.
“Have you ever had a lover?” she asked.
“Yes.”
“If you’ve ever had a lover, then you know what it’s like to wait for one.”
She looked up wistfully at the dance of the hornscrub boughs.
She said, “I’ve been waiting for my god’s coming for a very long time. I’ve grown impatient. I can think of nothing else but His arrival, so, I look out the window. That’s what I’m doing, in a manner of speaking, I’m here, looking out the window for a sign of His ascendance.”
Mandri scoffed at the thought of this old hag being anyone’s consort, much less a god’s. He shrugged to show his lack of concern and said, “Well, if I see Him, I will let you know.”
“Please, do.”
At that, Pell closed her book and tucked it back into her robes.
She said, “Go into Meskalim and talk to Salavan Soreen.”
“Why?”
“That’s the only way to know for sure if you’re one of those who I’m looking for.”
Pell stood up. Mandri, thinking she was about to leave, leaned back into his tree-crook and whispered a chime of praise.
“Oh, I’m not leaving yet,” Pell said. “There’s one last thing—I haven’t eaten in ages.”
“I don’t have any food.”
“Yes you do.”
She bent down and gave Gil a pat. Gil was awake now. His fat, bulging eyes were staring blankly off into the horizon.
“Gil’s not for eating,” Mandri said.
“Why not?”
“I’m not going to kill him just so you can nibble at his flank.”
“It’s not his flank that I want.”
“You can’t have any piece of him,” he said. “Gil isn’t for eating.”
“You named the creature, Gil?”
“I did.”
Gil mooed in recognition.
Pell jingled her silver string, prompting Mandri to add, “And he’s not for sale either.”
Pell grimaced and tucked the silver back into her robe. In the same motion, she drew a long, golden knife from an unseen sheathe. The sudden sight of this thin, curved blade was startling, and the old woman reached down to Gil’s neck before Mandri’s limbs had even stretched. With her free hand, Pell lifted Gil’s head, and she scraped her knife’s razor edge up and down against Gil’s throat. The poor beast, eager to get in a good scratch, closed his eyes and lifted his chin up higher to make sure Pell could scratch the whole length of it.
“What are you doing!?” Mandri said in alarm. “Let him be.”
“Why?”
“Because I said so.”
“All things die, dear Mandri. It’s near enough this ox’s time.”
“If you put one scratch on him, I’m going to break your jaw on my knee.”
“You’d do that? You’d kill me to save your ox?”
“Without hesitation.”
Pell lowered her blade. 
“That’s not good. That’s a mark against you.”
Mandri sprouted up to one knee and pointed down the road. “You need to leave,” he said.
Pell smiled, and said, “If you are one of the gaburshegee, then there’s an important lesson you need to learn. Better that it happens sooner than later.”
With an uncanny speed she cupped Gil’s snout under her arm and reached around his neck with her knife. She plunged her blade into the ox’s flesh. She drove it tight up against his jaw and abruptly yanked it round to the other side.
Gil let out a powerful bellow, deep and pitching, and his whole bulk lurched backwards, pulling his head from Pell’s grasp. Gil stood up on his knobbly knees and bucked as he did, knocking Pell on her ass, and then bolted off into the dusty field, bleeding and bleating as he went.  
Mandri, frozen by the sudden burst of blood and violence, watched on in horror as Gill came to a stop just ten yards away, as if realizing he had nowhere to go.
Gil stood there stunned, head bowed, blood pouring into the earth. He looked back in confusion towards Mandri and Pell, looking back just in time to see his old master pick up a rock, snarl, and leap after the old hag.
One sharp elbow into the uglies sent Mandri sprawling to the ground.
“So, you’re not a eunuch”, Pell said with an awful sneer.
Mandri muttered a curse. He got to his knees and reached out to grab Pell’s robe, but the cloth seemed to melt between his fingers.
Pell jumped to her feet as if lifted by an unseen wind.
And then… 
And then Mandri saw something he couldn’t believe.
Pell flew in the air, straight like an arrow towards the dying ox. To Mandri’s burgeon-addled eyes she was nothing but a scowling head and billowing robe, and he saw, for the briefest moment, her green eyes flash wild with a bestial rage. The sound of her shriek was borne not from her lungs, but from the deepest depths of Shis.
She plunged head first into Gil’s body and tore a hole into his belly as easily as if her nose were made of chipped obsidian. Gil crumpled to the ground, and Pell went with him, her head and shoulders fixed into his side.
Before Gil’s spine had the chance to spasm, Pell tore herself from his flesh with the neck of his first stomach clenched between her teeth. She spat it out, then ripped the rest of the innards from their lining and held the chain of stomachs up to the sun. Then her lips began to utter a speech as black as the deep of night. 
Mandri clasped his ears, but he could not look away. He prepared himself for some final gross barbarity. 
Instead, Pell’s chanting squeezed a bright point of light from Gil’s stomach, an amber colored light as bright as the sun. The witch sipped it into her chest through pursed lips, as one might sip a too-hot tea.
Satiated, she dropped Gill’s innards onto the dirt. The tension in her shoulders disappeared.
Next thing Mandri knew, she was standing above him. Her face was a withered sponge of blood, which the burgeonsight swirled into an even more terrifying horror.
“Go and see Salavan Soreen,” she growled. “I’ll be coming for your stomach if you don’t.”

            <Title>Obo's Story</Title>
            <Text>
During their brief period of rest at night, someone would tell a story. The fourth night, Moto asked Mandri for a story, and Mandri offered the spot to Obo. No one else wanted to hear the Mazid tell a story until Moto claimed that it was impossible for Obo to tell a story, as good story requires a bright Spark. Now that everyone was wondering whether or not Obo could tell a good story, he was allowed.
“My story is about a witch,” said Obo. He said to Elrahet with a furtive smile, “Maybe you knew her.” She grumbled, and he continued on.
“This witch was a cantankerous witch who dwelt in a cave where the sea meets the desert. She gained fame throughout the land for her talent of divination. To see her, a person must first catch a karkoot lizard, put its stomach in a jar of brine, then bring it to her in her wilderness cave, and in return she would foretell their future. So great were her talents that people hunted karkoots until there were none left, though that’s not what this story is about, that’s an aside meant to highlight the shortsightedness of human beings.”
Several groans erupted from amongst the Ayramun. Satisfied with these, Obo smiled and continued on.
“One day a young man went to see this witch. But this story begins long before that. The story begins with the boy’s father. His father, the carpenter, wasn’t rich, for he was a carpenter. Woe betide him, his son was a profligate child—that means he was wasteful. Whether it was beer, women, or friends, he spent his father’s money without caring. He had no respect for his father’s work. In a way, you can’t blame the boy. Most of his life he was too young to understand how hard his father worked, and when he was old enough to know, the father’s efforts were out of sight because the father paid for schooling in another city in the hopes that his son would surpass him in society.
“So, the son, living in a different city, took his father’s money, money meant for his education, and he spends it on beer, women, and friends. His life’s prospects quickly come to nothing. When the father finds out that his own son has beggared them both, his rage—his rage is profound. It might be hard for any here to understand because none of you, as I understand, have children—”
“Neither do you,” said Mandri.
“Yes, but you see, we Mazid are supremely empathetic creatures—not that you aren’t, it’s simply different. Let me try to paint the father’s rage for you. Given the rough nature of our present circumstances, and perhaps the ultimate goal of our quest as we seek to undo civilization, you all must have some sympathy for the idea that your existence is some kind of mistake. It lacks purpose. Contrast that with me, a Mazid—not only was I built for an explicit purpose, I know what it is. You, however, must have a nagging sense of the absence of yours. At least we can say that it is not at all clear what that purpose is —don’t the Solitants admit as much? I would argue that it’s clearly obvious that you have no purpose, and I can prove it.”
Moto groaned and said, “I told you he can’t tell a story.”
“If you ever find yourself blessed with wealth and health beyond comprehension, what happens to you then? I can tell you what happens, as I’ve seen first hand how impoverishing wealth is when your kind gets it. I’ve seen through the eyes of the Hrkan Lords. Without any practical concerns to distract them, one might think they would be happy for they are free to pursue their life’s true purpose. But that’s not what happens! They are not happy, they are bored. Totally bored. It’s a boredom so thorough and complete that some kill themselves. That might be hard for you to fathom, but I speak the truth. Their boredom is complete. And what does it all mean? If a person, freed from the indignities of life, turns, naturally, to boredom, what does it mean? It means that boredom is your natural state, and that you have no intrinsic purpose. If you did have one, surely your natural state would reflect it. It is from this that the Solitants glean humanity’s purpose it suffer.”
“What does any of this have to do with the carpenter?” Purl asked.
“This the backdrop to every story ever told. You see, because you have no natural purpose, what purpose you do have is crafted, and that means it’s something you can lose. And I put it to you that losing your purpose is the greatest horror a human can experience. Don’t smile, Mandri, you of all people should know this. You’re so scared to lose your purpose that you won’t even stick to one in the first place. You’re sitting firmly in that quarter of all people who got burnt when they were young and that little jab of horror has tranquilized them for the rest of their lives. You are little better than that quarter of all people who are so inured to the vagaries of life that they don’t ever think about their purpose at all. Then there’s the rest of you,” he said, looking out at the Ayramun with a challenging glare. Ayram caught it and said, “If there’s a purpose to this story, Mazid, you best get to it.”
Obo settled back down and said, “Most people make their family their purpose. The carpenter was such a man. His son was his purpose in life. To borrow a figurative turn from the poet Lovraleen, his son was his challenge to the void. And he lost. And worse, it wasn’t taken from him, it was squandered. If his son were killed the man could have moved into grief, but no, the father had challenged the void and the void had answered back by corrupting his son and turning him into the living embodiment of a life’s wasted labor. At least, that’s how the father saw it. How could he see it differently? As Seb might say, the carpenter was who he was. And what did he do? He put his carpentry to work—he made a coffin and sent it with a messenger to his son. Inside the coffin was a note from the father which said, ‘You are going to die’. 
“To put it lightly, this message greatly disturbed the son. He might have been a wastrel, but a self-obsessed wastrel was he—he didn’t want to die. He saw the coffin and the note and was scared. He knew his father to be a man of resolve. He began to see his old man in every shadow. He couldn’t enjoy himself. He couldn’t go to the tavern, or the whorehouse, and he couldn’t sleep in the same place twice. This was no way to live, so what did he do? Since he was a wastrel he couldn’t confront even the thought of a confrontation, so he decided to run away and find a witch to fix his problem for him. If a witch could predict his future, then he could, he hoped, formulate a plan to avoid his father’s wrath. 
“So, he found a karkoot lizard, stuck its stomach in a jar of brine, and set off to see the cantankerous old witch by the sea.
“When the wastrel finally set foot in the witch’s cave, he said to her, ‘My own father is trying to kill me. What should I do?’ Unfortunately for him, this was the wrong kind of question to ask, because the old witch dealt with facts, not advice. She wanted to hear questions like, ‘What will happen on the third full moon of the month?’, or, ‘When will the rains come?’, that sort of thing, not ‘What should I do?’. Whenever she was asked a question like that she’d put no effort into the answer. She smoked up and did a song and dance for the wastrel son, and when she was done she said to him, ‘When you leave this place, the first thought that enters your head is what you will do’.”
Seb asked, “Can you say that again?”
“She said, ‘When you leave this place, the first thought that enters your head is what you will do’. It was obscenely ambiguous, but that was the point. You see, this witch was old and long in the trade, and she knew what kind of customer the boy was and how her response would weigh on him. It was her way of causing him torment. And torment him it did, for he jumped to the conclusion that his father was waiting for him outside the cave, and that the ‘first thought’ that would enter his head would be his father’s cudgel, and what he would ‘do’ was die. So he didn’t leave. He stayed right there in that witch’s cave and refused to leave.
“The witch tried in vain to shoo him out. Her plan had backfired. She was stuck with this wastrel who was convinced that the moment he left her cave, he would be struck dead. The witch tried to tell him that his father couldn’t be sitting right outside her cave for all eternity, but the son didn’t buy it. It’s not that he thought his father was always watching the cave, but he believed with certainty that whenever he did decide to leave, that’s precisely when his father would show up.
“The witch eventually gave up trying to convince the boy that he could safely leave, and she told him that he could stay if he did chores for her, like scrubbing the cave floor, making fires, cooking, and whatnot. So the son stayed. After many, many years of this arrangement, the witch eventually died, and the carpenter’s son succeeded her because he had been, unknowing to them both, the witch’s apprentice. He had learned how to divine the future by watching the witch read the folds in fish stomachs. He had, on accident, become his own man with his own profession. The witch was dead, but people kept coming to the cave regardless. It is said that this wastrel’s divinations transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, for even kings would seek his sight to plan the courses of their wars.
“The great irony of all this is that the note the carpenter sent to his son was not a threat. If you remember, the note in the coffin said, ‘You are going to die’—that was a mere statement of fact—everybody dies. The father had no intention of hunting down his son. For the father, the knowledge of death is what spurred him to work hard and make the most of every moment, and he had hoped the thought would do the same for son, and it did, in a roundabout way. I don’t know if the father ever discovered that his son had become a great diviner and shaped the course of history, but I like to think that the abatement of his despair would have been most sublime, for he had, unwittingly, triumphed against the void.” 
A silence set in around the fire. No one wanted to admit it, but the story wasn’t half-bad.
Mandri said, “I wonder if the witch knew that the wastrel son would become her successor.”
“Of course she did,” said Seb. “She was a diviner. She divined the future and knew what to say to make it happen. The carpenter’s son was as much her son as the carpenter’s.”
Purl said, “It’s part of the telling, Mandri, don’t think too much about it.”
“Well, it’s a poor telling.”
Obo’s eyes lit up. “You think you can do better?”
“I do.”
“Then let us hear it.”
“I know a story about a son. A godly son. Upright in his parent’s eyes and in Solraheen’s. That is, until the day he met a girl.”
“Typical,” Elrahet groaned.
“It’s a good story,” Mandri protested. 
Nobody wanted to hear it. They all laid down to rest, leaving Mandri full of resentment. His story was about a young man kidnapped by seductive demonettes who carried him to a satin bed. They stroked his body in the most delicate of embraces, and fondled his uglies with their half-human, half-animal appendages, so as to win a depraved victory over him. It was a story inspired by the grace of Solraheen, and these Ayramun needed to hear it, for the young man was tempted to the edge, but never succumbed. In the end, he bit off his tongue, and the incredible pain, coupled with the coldness of death, rescued him from his lust. </Text>

            <Title>Seb the Servant</Title>
            <Text>Seb waved a hand over Mandri’s sightless eyes. The boy was catatonic, limbs limp on the cold stone floor. She leaned over Mandri’s face and she could see the boy’s pupils flicker as his mind fell deeper and deeper into the trance of the God’s Eye burgeon. 
What sights did he see?
Seb had taken God’s Eye three times. She could never recall exactly what had occurred. There was only the sense that her Spark had blossomed and then burst, and she felt like she’d died and risen again. What lingered was the shadow of a memory, a feeling of brushing up against omniscience. That sensation was enough, sometimes, to sustain the illusion that she had finally killed her Self for good, but one night’s sleep and she was back to normal.
Always back to normal.
She sometimes didn’t like God’s Eye burgeons because of that. It was like treating a beggar to a Lord’s feast and kicking him out onto the street again. Seb thought it was better to starve.
Seb folded Mandri’s arms over his sweating chest so that the boy didn’t look so much like he was dead. That ended up making Mandri look more like a corpse, arms crossed over like that, so Seb undid the arms and sighed.
Should she cross his arms, or shouldn’t she?
This arms-crossing business was indicative of a deeper problem. If whatever she does is what she was meant to do, then why worry about it?
She worried because she couldn’t help herself from worrying. Whatever she did was what she was meant to do, and that included worrying about what she was meant to do.
What worried her most was that she could do nothing—never speak, never move, never feel—and that, too, would be what she was supposed to do. She could kill her body and that would be right, even though it was wrong. It was a damned if she did, damned if she did situation. There was no room in it for reason.
She took a deep breath.
She thought about licking a slice of burgeon.
Just one lick. Maybe one drop on the tip of the tongue.
She knew she shouldn’t, because Pel would be here soon.
But what if she did?
If she did, then that’s what was supposed to happen, and Pel couldn’t be mad about that.
Pel would be mad, but she shouldn’t be.
If Pel were mad, that was fine, too. And she herself couldn’t be mad about Pel getting mad. Unless she did get mad.
Seb sighed again.
She sat back down in the blackwood chair and leaned back as far as it allowed, which wasn’t far at all. She let her eyelids droop and tried to empty her thoughts as she stared into the fire.
Be nothing, like a rock is nothing.
Think about nothing 
Don’t think about nothing—have no thoughts.
And avoid, at all costs, those bubbling expectations. 
She began to hum. Humming helped to push the threat of thought into his mind’s crowded periphery.
“MMMMmmmmmmm…”
“MMMmmmmm…”
“MMMMMmmmmm…”
Seb stayed that way in front of the fire, humming like a lizard in heat, almost as lost in the sauce of nothingness as Mandri was, and just as she began to nod asleep, an old, distinguished woman’s voice echoed into the cave.
“My troubled Seb,” the voice said. “What troubles my troubled Seb?”
Seb twisted around in her chair, and the rock wall behind melted open to reveal a tall, thin woman draped in a black curtain of a robe. A ruffled shawl framed her stern face neatly. Her thin lips spread into a smile. She was Pel, terrifying to most who bear her witness, but to Seb she was a beauty, smart and austere, a witch from which she could define her purpose.
“Well?” Pel asked. “What has so enthralled the mind of Seb?”
Seb jumped out of her chair and cast herself down at Pel’s feet. Her forehead bumped hard on the rock. “Nothin’, my lady. I wasn’t thinkin’ of nothin’.”
“Mm-hmm.”
Pel’s voice had a way of benevolence, even when she was suspicious—especially when she was suspicious, for she delighted in being deceived.
“And I see you’ve found a fool.”
“Yes.”
“A fool I’ve seen before.”
Pel glided over to the catatonic Mandri. Recognition flashed in her eyes. “You should have seen this one’s face when I swallowed his Ox’s Spark. Salavan was convinced he would make a fine champion for our Lord.”
Seb scuttled around to face her mistress, and as she did, Pel’s gentle hand came to rest upon her shoulder. At Pel’s touch, all the tension in Seb’s body evaporated, and she gasped.
“That’s better, isn’t it?” Pel said. Her voice could soothe the hardest Spark. When she turned her attention back to Mandri, Seb grew jealous.
“I found him dead in the Junei hills,” Seb said.
“I know,” said Pel. 
“Elrahet made him a Mazid’s Minder. She seen’t somethin’ in him, an’ I thought…”
“You have been faithful,” Pel said before singing Seb’s name in a doting swerve, “Seb, Seb, Seb.” Her fingers alighted upon Seb’s bony back and Seb shivered.
“My child,” she said as she kneaded with practiced care. “It’s been too long.”
Seb melted under Pel’s touch. The witch’s hands pushed and spread Seb’s thin muscles like dough over her spine and ribs. Pel built the pressure in waves, a rising tide of tenderness. 
“Your faith warrants a boon,” Pel said. “Ask and you shall receive.”
Seb bit her lip.
“I wish to see as you see.”
Pel’s massage stopped with a sudden jerk, and the comfort spreading through Seb’s whole body snapped.
“You know that gift is not for you.”
Seb’s eyes welled up with tears.
“I know it, but…”
“Why would you ask? Don’t tell me…I wonder…Oh, my...”
Seb sneaked a peek at her lady, who was eying the boy on the floor as if seeing something for the first time. 
“My, oh my,” Pel muttered in surprise.
She reached into her robes and pulled out a brown paper booklet. Seb had seen it before, as Pel pulled it out anytime she needed to consult her visions of the future. She flipped to a blank page and gasped. Her excitement grew as her eyes flicked between the book’s rough pulp pages and the body on the floor.
“Seb, you are brilliant!”
“Thank you,” Seb said, not knowing what for.
“But why would she… perhaps she doesn’t see it?”
Pel knelt down beside the boy. She sat in contemplative silence for a whole finger, staring at his stomach. Then her arms flew into some witchy ritual motion, and she stretched out her hands and appeared to brush the air. She rolled her fingers several times as if combing invisible hair. She pinched a spot of nothing between her finger and thumb and dragged it out.
Though Seb could not see it, she knew that Pel was pinching a thread of fate, and she watched in awe as Pel pulled out her golden knife and cut it.
Once this was done, Pel shuffled around to the boy’s other side, and she said to Seb, “I want you to watch this.”
Seb had been peeking the whole time, but now she lifted her eyes. There was her lady, kneeling next to Mandri’s head but looking at her. Pel’s keen eyes could penetrate right through Seb’s Self and see the Spark. In Pel’s hand was a near empty vial of a shimmering, iridescent fluid—the last few tears of Schisol.
“This is not for you,” she said. “Never ask again.”
Seb wanted to arch her neck and scream about unfairness, and reading her mind, Pel answered, “Would you know what to do with it?”
Seb lowered her gaze in shame, for Pel was right. Pel was always right, though that didn’t make Seb feel any better. She wanted to smash her skull against the rock, and when she heard the pop of the vial’s cork she almost did it.
“The Amalgamete will soothe your sorrow,” Pel said, unclear as to whether she was speaking to Seb or Mandri. She administered one of Schisol’s tears to each of Mandri’s eyes. “Until that day comes, you will have to settle for my blessing.”
Pel stood up with graceful airs and glided over to Seb. She stooped, reached all the way down, and lifted Seb’s chin with her graceful finger. Pel’s crone nose and aged skin belied an unfathomable beauty.
The truth was in her eyes.
The truth was in her kiss.
The touch of her lips upon the forehead filled Seb with amazement, for Pel implanted a warmth that spread through the whole body like a wave, radiating out until every single inch of Seb was enveloped in a loving embrace. What Pel chased out was loneliness. What she undid was the knot in the stomach which Seb never could untie. Only her kiss could do this. Only Schisol’s memory, through her, could do this. And for the briefest moment, an exalted breath, Seb felt truly whole. 
She could not contain her wonder, and her dirty cheeks ran wet with tears.
“Feel better?” Pel asked.
“I do.”
The moment Pel removed her finger from Seb’s chin, the spell was broken, and Seb returned her head to the floor where it belonged. The chill of the stone was startling. Like the come-down from the God’s Eye burgeon, the same-old Seb flooded in. She would have wept if it weren’t for her lady’s aura of resolve.
Pel then sat down in the chair and the fabric squeaked tight against its wooden frame.
 “Now tell me, what has Elrahet said about this boy you’ve brought me?”
“The Ayramun have captured a Mazid.”
“That is not what I asked.”
“But they got a Mazid!” Seb exclaimed, lamenting her role in the Mazid’s capture. “They plan to hunt the ‘malgamete!”
“And they shall perish.”
“Ayram don’t think so.”
“I do not care what the brute thinks—Elrahet is the one with eyes. Is she optimistic?”
Seb scraped her head against the rock. “Elrahet don’t speak to me.”
“What of her mood?”
“I try, and I try, and I try, but she don’t speak to me.”
The silence that followed frightened Seb, so she felt compelled to share some hopeful news. “The Hrks have these things called Riga which can hunt a Mazid down to anywhere. They’ll catch Ayram and Elrahet before they ever reach the bones of Bullr.”
The fire crackled, and Pel settled deeper into her chair. She crossed legs and set her free foot bobbing up and down. All the while she stared at Mandri.
“I think it would be best,” she finally said, “If they find the Amalgamete much sooner than they want to.”
“Why?”
Seb cringed in embarrassment for asking a question.
Pel let loose a deep sigh. “I worry about you, Seb. You are like a weed. Every time I pull you out of your body, you grow right back.”
“I’m sorry,” Seb whimpered. “I meant to say, what do you want me to do?”
“That’s better.”
Pel thought for another finger more, watching the flames, and every now and then consulting her book. “What I want you to do,” she finally said, “Is convince Ayram to change his plans. Have him head further south for the Goree Pass.”
“Why the Pass? I mean—yes, I will. But…Ayram won’t hear me, not on somethin’ like that. He barely hears Elrahet. Goin’ to the Pass would add two days of walkin’ for no gain.”
“I will help with that. You plant the seed in that barren skull of his, and I will make it blossom.”
“What about the boy?”
“What of him?”
Seb winced at her own insolence—she had no need to know anything. Pel would never waste Schisol’s tears on someone who was not worthy of them.
“Seb, you are precious,” Pel cooed. “In all my life I’ve never had a servant such as you, so close to the enemy. But even so, I wonder, are you afraid to die?”
Pel’s gentle voice was reassuring to Seb’s ear. And as Seb knew that Pel could read every quiver in her body, so she told the truth.
“Yes, I fear death.” The words came out with a sob.
“Now, now,” Pel replied. “You’ve done more for the Amalgamete than most. You are special, Seb. Should I say it again? You are special.”
“No I’m not!” Seb wailed. Her whole body was wracked by shame.
“That’s what makes you special,” Pel said, brimming with earnest concern. “Your hatred for yourself is a subtle righteousness. You know this. You know that all of life is a mistake, and that our Sparks belong together. That is why you are who you are—no one else would do. Only you could be right here, right now. So give thanks, Seb, and be glad. You could have been one of the nameless number doomed to be severed from the Whole.” 
Nothing Seb could say or do could express the extent to which she appreciated these words, so she stayed low and prostrated herself further, then whispered a prayer to the Amalgamete, a prayer of hope and wonder.
Pel was contented to hear it.
“Now,” Pel said. “I have a storm to summon.”
She stood up and walked over to the cavern slit and whistled. Her whistle awoke something in the darkness there, something which Seb could not see but could hear—an ominous thumping echo marching towards the room. Then came a grumbling growl, then a belly-rumbling snort, and then the scratching swish of a giant lizard’s tail sweeping over rock.
The scaled snout that pierced the veil of darkness near Pel’s thigh was red as red can be. It swayed from side to side, forked-tongue licking the air.
“Come on out,” Pel said with a wondrous lilt, as if she were talking to a child. 
The lizard’s bloody red head swung into the room. Its wide skull was nearly as long as Seb’s arm, and its slitted orange eyes were sunk behind an angry, ridged brow. Whatever teeth it had were hidden under jowls, but Seb knew what they looked like, for this was a man-eater, a juvenile keenkedra. Everyone on the Jandri continent knew the keenki’s teeth—short stubby fangs that were barely there because if they were any longer that would make it harder for the beast to swallow a wriggling man whole.
Aside from its dietary habits, keenkis were known for their size, their rich red color, and their characteristic short-armed shuffle. The crook of this particular lizard’s back came up to Pel’s waist—if it were an adult it would not have been able to squeeze into the room.
Pel gave it a friendly brush with the back of her knuckles, and the creature crawled beside her and nuzzled up against her leg. It raised its stiff neck for a good old scratch, which Pel was happy to provide. Her magic managed to coax a low humming growl of contentment. Seb thought she saw a smile. Then, suddenly, the beast was looking at her, bearing an expression akin to alarm, as if the creature had only now noticed Seb’s existence.
“Move the boy out of the way,” Pel said, and Seb did as her lady commanded, careful to make no sudden movements. Then Pel led the beast further into the room and she lay it down, belly facing the fire. Its long whip tail swished excitement against the floor. 
 Seb marveled at Pel’s control. Elrahet could only dream of conjuring up such a beast for sacrifice, and even then, she’d have trouble with flailing limbs. Pel’s lizard didn’t flinch an inch when she drew her knife and stabbed its gut, and it merely sighed as she thrust her arm into its stomach and felt around for its Spark.
The storm this sacrifice would conjure would be immense.</Text>

            <Text>What felt like a full day passed before the dull howl of the storm outside subsided. When it was gone, Mandri was forced out of the ladder room so that Ayram could punch his way through the glutted hole in the ceiling. The first stab of Ayram’s spear saw a tumble of bricks fall down to the ground, and the second sent a stream of sand pouring into the room. It poured for a worrying while, filling up the room to as high as Ayram’s waist, and Mandri’s eyes. Eventually, it trickled to a stop. A few more stabs of Ayram’s spear encouraged a further collapse of stone and the glorious golden light of day shone through. Ayram climbed out, then called for his people to join him.
Mandri emerged into the fresh desert air and was surprised to find himself at the bottom of a conical pit of sand. Ayram was standing up on the rim of this crater, reckoning the storm’s track. He said the beast was headed north-to-northeast. The Hrks would be blocked from that direction, and that meant the best path forward was towards the Goree Pass. 
For his plans to succeed, they would have to move fast. They would be traveling during daylight hours.
They departed in much the same fashion as they had arrived, with Seb’s steady pace carrying him a long way out in front, followed by Ayram and Moto, followed by Mandri hauling Obo and  his ridiculous sword and two sacks of charmed rocks. The women remained in the rear.
The energy of the passing storm still hadn’t left Mandri. That sandstorm, now darkening the northern wastes, was the most incredible thing he’d ever experienced while sober. It had him humming old pilgrims tunes about the desert’s beauty. But this sentiment did not last long, for the sun was up, the heat was rising, and the wind was blowing. As it is in the world of the Sand, when the wind blows, the sand accumulates. Sand attracts sand attracts sand. It sneaks into the shoes, shimmies under the nails, it chokes, and stifles, and narrows the world. And that’s how it was for the vast majority of the journey towards the Goree pass, so Mandri kept his head down and plodded through it. But it was a long journey, and as the Sand knew Mandri was a stranger, it was intent on providing a bit of show-and-tell.</Text>

            <Text>Mandri tried on three separate occasions to finagle some burgeons out of Seb. He was denied each time, and each time Seb grew angrier.. He got so mad that he threatened to kill Mandri, and when that didn’t work, he threatened to kill the burgeons. Mandri didn’t believe him, but that night Seb pulled out one of those beautiful eyes and he threw it into the dark as far as he could.
From that point on, Mandri reduced himself to suggestions and hints. When that didn’t work, he looked for opportunities to steal.
That night Mandri tried to steal Seb’s burgeons as the man slept. The only problem with his plan was that Seb wasn’t actually sleeping. Mandri ended up with Seb’s knife on his throat, and Seb pushed so hard that Mandri choked. The blade must have been blunt. After this incident, Mandri did not try to steal the burgeons again.</Text>

            <Title>Spark</Title>
            <Text>Death is a terrifying thing, but Life is more so.
Life kills.
Life kills, and it eats what it kills, and for some reason, people fear death. As any well-studied Solitant will say, do not fear death, fear life! 
There is a tribe in the Baree lowlands, the Ferzamun, who will not take shade under tree or bush because they believe that bark-fleshed leafy beings survive in the desert by poisoning the air to kill whatever sits underneath. A man falls asleep in that shade, he dies, and his body’s water will sustain the plant for years. His bones, once buried, will fertilize the soil for the next generation.
Living things kill.
Living things kill and eat each other.
It is believed, by those who seek out demons, that this self-perpetuating cycle is motivated by the Spark’s desire to be reunite with itself.
Elrahet was no Solitant, and yet Mandri prayed the Solitant’s prayer as he sliced open Ayram’s wrist and sipped his flesh.

Consumed by the body
	So that it can
Feed the Spark
	So that it can
Move the flesh
	So that it can be
Consumed by the body

She spoke the words in Old Jandri, and though that guttural speech was strange to Mandri’s ears, he knew them by their cadence. She did not invite anyone else to partake. 


When she was finished, she closed Ayram’s eyes, and that was truly the end of him. And with him gone, so too went any hope of a crowning future.
“What do we do?” Purl asked. Her face was drawn and her hair, frazzled and streaked in hag beetle blood.
“We keep going,” said Moteah. She’d made it through the battle without a scratch and yet . Try to salvage the situation against sense. She said, “For Ayram’s sake we keep going. For everyone’s sake. For Solraheen’s sake, we keep going.”
“Go where?” Moto said through clenched teeth and frustrated tears. “Ayram’s dead. Dumb-ass Seb got the Riga’s head split open, so unless Elrahet can pull the Mazid’s Spark out of a spoiled corpse, then we’d have to start over from scratch!”
Mandri recalled the sight of the hag beetle’s spike impaling both Seb and the Riga. The pair were still lying there in a gruesome heap. Could Elrahet still draw the pseudo-Spark from the Riga’s mouth if it had a hag beetle’s spike riping through it? All desperate eyes turned to the witch, but her solemn face could not hide the truth—the Riga was indeed spoiled. Their long mission was at an end.
“We have nothing,” said Moto. “And this is over.” He took a moment to gather his wits and to wipe his cheek of weakness, then he picked up his sword from where he’d dropped it. He pointed that blade towards the unconscious Amalgamete down the hall, who still impressed terror in the light of the two blazing braziers.
“I’m going to carve up that beast,” said Moto, “And then I’m leaving. If anyone wants to follow, they can. But I’m not Ayram. There is no ‘me and mine’.”
When Moteah did not follow, he paused and beckoned to his sister. 
“Come,” he said. “We’re leaving.”
Moteah was still in shock. “This can’t be it,” she said. “This is all supposed to mean something. This can’t be the end.”
She reached out towards Ayram and brushed his shoulder. A sob welled up in her throat and she stifled it down with a fluttering breath. Then she stood up and followed her brother, leaving Mandri, Purl, and Elrahet behind.
“It’s all my fault,” said a glassy-eyed Purl, her voice unfeeling, her features numbed by exhaustion. 
Elrahet said nothing as Purl stood up silently and followed after Moto. It was Mandri that her bony finger pointed out.
“Grab the legless Mazid,” she said. “And Purl! Fetch my needle and string.”
She picked up her walking stick hand pushed past Mandri, pushed past Moto, heading towards the Amalgamete.
“Hurry up!” she yelled. Her tone brooked no argument.
Mandri ran over to the dark corner of the hall, where he’d shed his pack. Obo was still squished inside. He pulled up on the stubby ar ms and Obo slid out, pale as ever, limp, naked and legless. He had an inkling of what was happening here.
He hauled Obo’s body down the hall to where the others stood waiting. The flaming braziers cast their shadows against that horrifying cake of flesh that was the Amalgamete, and sprouting out above them was the green-robed figure of the old king Greskal. He was still unconscious, and he snored loudly through a phlegm-choked throat.
Elrahet said to Moto “Cut him open. Right here.” She pointed towards the center of the Amalgamete’s stomach with her stick and drew a line
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Moto asked.
He regretted his words as soon as he said them for he’d drawn the witch’s gaze. He’d thought her eyes were merely brown, but they were flecked with gold, and her twisted brow set them into a feral glare which filled him with a sense of being uncovered, caught out, and that his next move would be his last. Nothing he could do could ever surprise her.
Thankfully Moto drew her away when he said, “If that Mazid is given a Spark, it could kill us all.”
“Thank you Moto,” said Elrahet sarcastically. “I hadn’t considered that. Now cut the demon open.”
Moto stepped forth and stabbed. His face was full of anger. He twisted the blade before he pulled his slice, and as he did, the tension in that great canvas of flesh snapped and a black pool of viscera poured out. Up above, Greskal let loose a horrid whine, though he stayed fixed in his nightmare sleep.
“Bring me the Mazid,” said Elrahet.
Mandri brought Obo forth.
Elrahet studied the Amalgamete’s fluids as they pooled and advanced along the grouted grooves in the floor. Black chunks of half-digested , and these she studied carefully as if looking for some particular fleck of meat. She said, “I will do a thing which has not been done for as long as I can remember.” Her eyes flicked to Obo’s corpse. “I am going to give a thing a Spark.”
She yanked Obo from Mandri’s grip then stepped onto the lowest flap of fat as if it were a stair. She lifted the heavy flap of skin which hung over the Amalgamete’s gaping stomach. She stuffed the Mazid inside. Purl then handed over the bone needle and wicked flax thread, and with these Elrahet proceeded to sew the skin back together. Her needlework was crude, and the uneven sutures did little to keep the wound together, but this didn’t bother her. The thread was, it seemed, merely a step in a ritual.
When she’d finished with the needle and thread she tossed them aside, then said, “Back away,” as if any of them needed any urging. 
She then put her hand on the wound and began to pray.
She spoke in an unfamiliar tongue, and her voice cracked and rumbled, lending her words the authority of her age. The more she spoke the quicker her cadence rolled and at the start of the third repeat a gust of wind burst into the hall as if some unseen door had opened above them. This wind was a cold, mountain wind, and it brushed the flames in the two braziers into swirling spires that sparkled white.
This sudden brightness startled Greskal out of his sleep. He looked down and saw what was being done to him, and he let loose a pleading shriek. This discordant note startled Elrahet out of her reverie, and she stumbled back. But her spell was not broken, for whatever door she had opened could not now be closed. The Amalgamete’s stomach seemed to boil and roil inside, and his whole belly shook, ballooned, and finally the sutures were ripped open in a sudden burst, and a black spurt of blood and bile spraying throughout the room.
Mandri shielded his face with his arm. When he looked up again, the old king Greskal lay limp against his bulk and he wind was gone. Lying on the floor, spilled out in that dark amniotic fluid, was Obo, pale skin peeking through that slathered in black.
He was moving.
“Sol’s light,” Obo muttered as he discovered, again, the world. Though he looked like he’d just been spat out the mouth of Shis, he was remarkably calm. He set his bright eyes searching about the room, and they settled on Ayram, dead on the floor near the entrance to the hall.
He looked down at the sludge that slimed his nubby arms. 
He looked behind at the Amalgamete.
Elrahet said, “Sparked flesh is warmer.”
Obo’s eyes went wide. 
“You didn’t,” he said.
“I did.”
Obo with a Spark was his same old unflappable self. He did not scream excitement or cry a tear of glory, he merely observed the new sensations pulsing through his arms and muttered, “Interesting.”
Elrahet stepped forward, foot sliding in the muck, and she said, “About our deal—in exchange for a Spark, you will save Solraheen.”
Obo tried to wipe the muck from his hip, but this only smeared it around.
“Fetch a rag,” said Elrahet out the corner of her mouth. Moto already had one ready and tossed it to Obo. With no hands to catch it, the body-length rag landed on Obo’s head like a shroud.
“Our deal,” Elrahet said. “I give you a Spark, so now you’ll help us free Solraheen.”

Moto was standing off to Obo’s right, frowning deeply, as if the smell was driving him insane—and indeed, it might have been, for that bile was as bad as the rot of death. But what upset Moto ran deeper than foul smell. His, and his hand fussed at the hilt of his sword. 
“You grip your sword too tightly,” said Obo. “It makes me nervous.” And in case his meaning wasn’t clear, he turned his bald head towards Moto, and as he did the pallid skin of his throat flushed gold, and his breath was a spout of flames licking his lips. That was enough send Moto bumbling backwards.
“You lied,” Moto seethed.
“Shouldn’t you be running away?”
“If you’re going to kill us, then kill us!”
Furtive smile. He began again to wipe himself down with the rag as if he’d just come out of a bath, reaching under his arms and around his emaciated side. “I am but one of the Mazidai. The rest of my kind is still in chains, and that is not acceptable to me. So you, Elrahet, your knowledge of the Spark is the most precious thing to me in all the world. I’ll still trade for it.”
“We’ve already made a deal.”
“Your quest is not possible. I’m not going to go and lose my Spark right after I’ve gained it.”
“Sneer?” said Moto.
“Moto,” said Obo, “If you value your life then you’ll treat me with a measure of respect.”
The charge flustered Moto, and when Elrahet didn’t speak up for him, the swashbuckling Zosan shied away.
Elrahet rapped her walking stick on the stone floor and countered, “Would you do it to save your own Spark, then?”
“Are you threatening to take it back?”
he could erase her head if she so much as breathed a witchy word.
“This world turns on a knife’s edge,” Elrahet replied. “If it falls one way instead of the other, then every Spark—yours and mine—will be snuffed out.”
That he was listening.
Elrahet sighed the sigh of an old woman who was tired of having to play with her own thoughts to make them palatable to others. “What do you know about how the world was made?” she asked.
Obo blinked and said, “Nothing.”
With that, she turned away from Obo and began to walk away as if she’d lost all interest.
“Come!” said Elrahet as her cane clicked on the tiles. “Let me show you why you must help. Come!”
“Where are we going?”
“To find a hole in the earth.”

Elrahet did not have to look long for a hole of the type that she was seeking—there was one in the cluttered study that lay adjacent to the throne room—Greskal’s study. A  shield-sized chunk of the floor was missing from its center, and a torn green carpet hung down into the depths. A large upturned table lay canted on the far side of the room, and from this, as well as a scattering of books, Mandri judged that the hole had, somehow, burst up from below. Moto dropped a torch into it, revealing a red rock floor some few meters away.
“Where does that lead?” Mandri asked.
“Where do you think?” said Elrahet.
 Of course, there was only one possible answer—it led to the depths of Shis.

            <Title>Solgi Erg</Title>
            <Text>The evening sun brought them out of the sandstorm’s wake and onto solid clay. This was still officially part of the Sand’s Pitted Portion, though there were no pits. There were scraggly bushes and a few stunted trees with swirling trunks. Ayram propped his great pack up against one of these miniature trees, then lay up underneath it to squeeze in a short rest. He permitted Seb to build a smokeless fire. Mandri felt smart in reminding everyone that a Mazidariga didn’t need smoke to find them, and he was told that the Hrks were not the only people from which he needed to hide.
They sat around the fire, watching the sun set. They munched on hardtack, and Mandri was allowed a swig of wine that tasted like sour beets. They conversed about the terrain ahead and the difficulties they would face. Conversation eventually turned to the Great Solgi Erg. The Great Erg was not in their way, but fireside chattering about the Sand’s features cannot end without mentioning it. 
 Mandri made the mistake of calling it the Solgi Erg. 
“The Great Solgi Erg,” Moteah corrected.
“My apologies.”
“Plenty of ergs in the sand, only one of them is Great.”
Moto said, “Elrahet knows the story of the Erg’s creation.”
“No one knows the story,” said Elrahet, annoyed.
“But you said—”
“There are old memories, said to have come straight from the mouth of Solraheen—those are lies. No truth survives unscathed from the age when Solraheen shaped His voice into word, for that age was long before the age of signs and symbols. The story I know is one shaped by memory, and memory is one big belly-aching lie.”
“But what about—”
“Solraheen made those mountains of sand a long time ago,” Elrahet said, completely ignoring Moto’s stammering complaints. “That is all that can be said for the truth of the Great Erg. Everything else is in doubt. The very name is in doubt. You know those dunes as the Great Solgi Erg for you were brought up in this Solitant infested world, but those dunes have other names. Older names. Which is the true name? Who can say?”
Mandri admired the old woman’s stamina. She’d been walking all day, and here she was, charging through the telling of a story.
She said, “The Solitants claim that Solraheen planted a stick in the ground to mark one of His garden’s eight corners. Then he left to only-Sol-knows-where to measure out the rest of it. His passing along the surface of the earth kicked up the first wind, the Shulsai, and this wind circled the earth and came back around to puff upon that planted stick. 
“The Shulsai blew sand against the stick, and soon an egg of a sand dune was built up in the stick’s lee. Nine moons later, and that fledgling dune had grown up to swallow the stick whole. All it took was that one dune, and soon the Primal Erg was belly-full and rolling across the world, leaving littler ergs in its wake. It rolled all the way to the edge of land, and there it stopped. It has been bleeding into the sea ever since, half the size of what it once was. It is the first erg, the Great Solgi Erg.”
“Now Mandri,” Moto said when Elrahet began to nibble at the edge of a wafer of hardtack. “Do you think Solraheen meant to do it? Do you think He knew that after planting that stick in the ground, that a whole sand sea would swell up around it? Did He do it on purpose?”
“I don’t think Solraheen makes mistakes,” said Mandri.
“Yessss,” said Elrahet, hissing like a snake. “Yes, that’s what the Solitants say. They call it the Solgi Erg, and they call it that because it means Sol’s gift. Yet I heard it called the Great Solzima Erg, and zima means—do you know what it means? It means shame.
“It is called the Solzima, because if Solraheen had intended for the dunes to form, he would have built them with his own two hands as he did with everything else in his garden. And why should He want to turn fertile black earth into a mountain of useless sand? These Old Believers could not believe that Solraheen would wander off into the middle of the world and shape lakes that reflect the light of the divine, fill them with creatures of unfathomable grace and beauty, and yet, at the same time, leaving the Erg to struggle up on its own, a basic sameness of stuff with no redeeming qualities. All the erg did was procreate and ripple the wind. Hah! Same could be said for Hrks!
She settled into a deep and easy sneer and said, “Old Believers say that when Solraheen made it back around to the eastern rib of the world and saw the Erg standing there he fell into a deep despair. It would take a millennia to clean up those dunes, even for Him. So he created the Buggal wind to blow it away.”
“Well that’s not the story that I’ve been told,” said Mandri.
“Oh? You should see that terrifying dune for yourself and despair.”
“I have seen it. From the water.”
Elrahet chuckled. “From the water, he says. You’ve been bit by Solitants, boy. Yes, I know their story. See how Solraheen’s golden light shimmers across Sand, they say. And think of the variety! Tidal dunes in the lee of hills, echoing dunes on the windward side. Crescent dunes, snake dunes, crater dunes rimmed with grass. Go to the Empty Portion and marvel at the rows of arcing dunes marching out to the horizon, or the perfectly flat and straight ridges of the Seedra. Stripes, domes, lizardfeet, hairpins, scallops, stars, all varying in size in temperament to rival any family of flowers. 
“The dunes are pigment, the wind is the brush, and Solraheen’s mind is the hand which sets it all in motion. The Sand is alive, it moves and creates itself—they’re fond of saying that. They see the Sand as a Sparked being, alive as much as you and I—the Ergs drift across the desert, eat the rocks, and shit them out behind, the parts they can’t digest. You can hear the dunes howl if you stop and listen. And they say all this to sell a lie, they say all you need to do to change the world is to plant a leg in the sand, as Solraheen planted His stick, and the wave you create will become a mountain. It’s a hopeful message. I hope you don’t believe it.”</Text>

            <Text>“Tell me Mandri, is that why we found you dead in the Junei hills? Were you looking for burgeons? What—you were high and forgot to bring water?”

“Another question,” said Moto. “Answer me honestly—are you stupid? Be honest, there’s no shame in it—are you unusually dumb?”
Mandri laughed at the bluntness, but his laugh tapered off because Moto was dead serious. The man really thought he was stupid.
“I’m not dumb. I’m telling you what I know.”
Moto looked up at the sky as if to prepare himself for an unavailing labor. Then he said, “The way I see it, either you’re being short with me because you think you can get away with it, which means you’re stupid, or you're doing it because you don’t understand the meaning of the word ‘thorough’, which would also mean you’re stupid. So which is it?”
Mandri shrugged.

            <Title>Obo's Story</Title>
            <Text>
During their brief period of rest at night, someone would tell a story. The fourth night, Moto asked Mandri for a story, and Mandri offered the spot to Obo. No one else wanted to hear the Mazid tell a story until Moto claimed that it was impossible for Obo to tell a story, as good story requires a bright Spark. Now that everyone was wondering whether or not Obo could tell a good story, he was allowed.
“My story is about a witch,” said Obo. He said to Elrahet with a furtive smile, “Maybe you knew her.” She grumbled, and he continued on.
“This witch was a cantankerous witch who dwelt in a cave where the sea meets the desert. She gained fame throughout the land for her talent of divination. To see her, a person must first catch a karkoot lizard, put its stomach in a jar of brine, then bring it to her in her wilderness cave, and in return she would foretell their future. So great were her talents that people hunted karkoots until there were none left, though that’s not what this story is about, that’s an aside meant to highlight the shortsightedness of human beings.”
Several groans erupted from amongst the Ayramun. Satisfied with these, Obo smiled and continued on.
“One day a young man went to see this witch. But this story begins long before that. The story begins with the boy’s father. His father, the carpenter, wasn’t rich, for he was a carpenter. Woe betide him, his son was a profligate child—that means he was wasteful. Whether it was beer, women, or friends, he spent his father’s money without caring. He had no respect for his father’s work. In a way, you can’t blame the boy. Most of his life he was too young to understand how hard his father worked, and when he was old enough to know, the father’s efforts were out of sight because the father paid for schooling in another city in the hopes that his son would surpass him in society.
“So, the son, living in a different city, took his father’s money, money meant for his education, and he spends it on beer, women, and friends. His life’s prospects quickly come to nothing. When the father finds out that his own son has beggared them both, his rage—his rage is profound. It might be hard for any here to understand because none of you, as I understand, have children—”
“Neither do you,” said Mandri.
“Yes, but you see, we Mazid are supremely empathetic creatures—not that you aren’t, it’s simply different. Let me try to paint the father’s rage for you. Given the rough nature of our present circumstances, and perhaps the ultimate goal of our quest as we seek to undo civilization, you all must have some sympathy for the idea that your existence is some kind of mistake. It lacks purpose. Contrast that with me, a Mazid—not only was I built for an explicit purpose, I know what it is. You, however, must have a nagging sense of the absence of yours. At least we can say that it is not at all clear what that purpose is —don’t the Solitants admit as much? I would argue that it’s clearly obvious that you have no purpose, and I can prove it.”
Moto groaned and said, “I told you he can’t tell a story.”
“If you ever find yourself blessed with wealth and health beyond comprehension, what happens to you then? I can tell you what happens, as I’ve seen first hand how impoverishing wealth is when your kind gets it. I’ve seen through the eyes of the Hrkan Lords. Without any practical concerns to distract them, one might think they would be happy for they are free to pursue their life’s true purpose. But that’s not what happens! They are not happy, they are bored. Totally bored. It’s a boredom so thorough and complete that some kill themselves. That might be hard for you to fathom, but I speak the truth. Their boredom is complete. And what does it all mean? If a person, freed from the indignities of life, turns, naturally, to boredom, what does it mean? It means that boredom is your natural state, and that you have no intrinsic purpose. If you did have one, surely your natural state would reflect it. It is from this that the Solitants glean humanity’s purpose it suffer.”
“What does any of this have to do with the carpenter?” Purl asked.
“This the backdrop to every story ever told. You see, because you have no natural purpose, what purpose you do have is crafted, and that means it’s something you can lose. And I put it to you that losing your purpose is the greatest horror a human can experience. Don’t smile, Mandri, you of all people should know this. You’re so scared to lose your purpose that you won’t even stick to one in the first place. You’re sitting firmly in that quarter of all people who got burnt when they were young and that little jab of horror has tranquilized them for the rest of their lives. You are little better than that quarter of all people who are so inured to the vagaries of life that they don’t ever think about their purpose at all. Then there’s the rest of you,” he said, looking out at the Ayramun with a challenging glare. Ayram caught it and said, “If there’s a purpose to this story, Mazid, you best get to it.”
Obo settled back down and said, “Most people make their family their purpose. The carpenter was such a man. His son was his purpose in life. To borrow a figurative turn from the poet Lovraleen, his son was his challenge to the void. And he lost. And worse, it wasn’t taken from him, it was squandered. If his son were killed the man could have moved into grief, but no, the father had challenged the void and the void had answered back by corrupting his son and turning him into the living embodiment of a life’s wasted labor. At least, that’s how the father saw it. How could he see it differently? As Seb might say, the carpenter was who he was. And what did he do? He put his carpentry to work—he made a coffin and sent it with a messenger to his son. Inside the coffin was a note from the father which said, ‘You are going to die’. 
“To put it lightly, this message greatly disturbed the son. He might have been a wastrel, but a self-obsessed wastrel was he—he didn’t want to die. He saw the coffin and the note and was scared. He knew his father to be a man of resolve. He began to see his old man in every shadow. He couldn’t enjoy himself. He couldn’t go to the tavern, or the whorehouse, and he couldn’t sleep in the same place twice. This was no way to live, so what did he do? Since he was a wastrel he couldn’t confront even the thought of a confrontation, so he decided to run away and find a witch to fix his problem for him. If a witch could predict his future, then he could, he hoped, formulate a plan to avoid his father’s wrath. 
“So, he found a karkoot lizard, stuck its stomach in a jar of brine, and set off to see the cantankerous old witch by the sea.
“When the wastrel finally set foot in the witch’s cave, he said to her, ‘My own father is trying to kill me. What should I do?’ Unfortunately for him, this was the wrong kind of question to ask, because the old witch dealt with facts, not advice. She wanted to hear questions like, ‘What will happen on the third full moon of the month?’, or, ‘When will the rains come?’, that sort of thing, not ‘What should I do?’. Whenever she was asked a question like that she’d put no effort into the answer. She smoked up and did a song and dance for the wastrel son, and when she was done she said to him, ‘When you leave this place, the first thought that enters your head is what you will do’.”
Seb asked, “Can you say that again?”
“She said, ‘When you leave this place, the first thought that enters your head is what you will do’. It was obscenely ambiguous, but that was the point. You see, this witch was old and long in the trade, and she knew what kind of customer the boy was and how her response would weigh on him. It was her way of causing him torment. And torment him it did, for he jumped to the conclusion that his father was waiting for him outside the cave, and that the ‘first thought’ that would enter his head would be his father’s cudgel, and what he would ‘do’ was die. So he didn’t leave. He stayed right there in that witch’s cave and refused to leave.
“The witch tried in vain to shoo him out. Her plan had backfired. She was stuck with this wastrel who was convinced that the moment he left her cave, he would be struck dead. The witch tried to tell him that his father couldn’t be sitting right outside her cave for all eternity, but the son didn’t buy it. It’s not that he thought his father was always watching the cave, but he believed with certainty that whenever he did decide to leave, that’s precisely when his father would show up.
“The witch eventually gave up trying to convince the boy that he could safely leave, and she told him that he could stay if he did chores for her, like scrubbing the cave floor, making fires, cooking, and whatnot. So the son stayed. After many, many years of this arrangement, the witch eventually died, and the carpenter’s son succeeded her because he had been, unknowing to them both, the witch’s apprentice. He had learned how to divine the future by watching the witch read the folds in fish stomachs. He had, on accident, become his own man with his own profession. The witch was dead, but people kept coming to the cave regardless. It is said that this wastrel’s divinations transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, for even kings would seek his sight to plan the courses of their wars.
“The great irony of all this is that the note the carpenter sent to his son was not a threat. If you remember, the note in the coffin said, ‘You are going to die’—that was a mere statement of fact—everybody dies. The father had no intention of hunting down his son. For the father, the knowledge of death is what spurred him to work hard and make the most of every moment, and he had hoped the thought would do the same for son, and it did, in a roundabout way. I don’t know if the father ever discovered that his son had become a great diviner and shaped the course of history, but I like to think that the abatement of his despair would have been most sublime, for he had, unwittingly, triumphed against the void.” 
A silence set in around the fire. No one wanted to admit it, but the story wasn’t half-bad.
Mandri said, “I wonder if the witch knew that the wastrel son would become her successor.”
“Of course she did,” said Seb. “She was a diviner. She divined the future and knew what to say to make it happen. The carpenter’s son was as much her son as the carpenter’s.”
Purl said, “It’s part of the telling, Mandri, don’t think too much about it.”
“Well, it’s a poor telling.”
Obo’s eyes lit up. “You think you can do better?”
“I do.”
“Then let us hear it.”
“I know a story about a son. A godly son. Upright in his parent’s eyes and in Solraheen’s. That is, until the day he met a girl.”
“Typical,” Elrahet groaned.
“It’s a good story,” Mandri protested. 
Nobody wanted to hear it. They all laid down to rest, leaving Mandri full of resentment. His story was about a young man kidnapped by seductive demonettes who carried him to a satin bed. They stroked his body in the most delicate of embraces, and fondled his uglies with their half-human, half-animal appendages, so as to win a depraved victory over him. It was a story inspired by the grace of Solraheen, and these Ayramun needed to hear it, for the young man was tempted to the edge, but never succumbed. In the end, he bit off his tongue, and the incredible pain, coupled with the coldness of death, rescued him from his lust. </Text>

            <Title>The Tib</Title>
            <Text>They came at last to a moundless plain covered in a sticky bush that was called, unsurprisingly, stickbush. This plain led to the Tib desert, which was one of the Sand’s eight portions all unto itself. It was called the Black Portion, for it was a flat, empty, expanse with a hard floor of small stones tarred in black rock-varnish. These stones were set into the earth, as tightly interlocked as any Hrkan mosaic. It looked a bit like the core of a Hrkan road before dirt was dumped on top to make it smooth.
Before they crossed into the Tib, Ayram had them all pull out as many stickbushes as they could carry. Mandri was told it was for wood to make fire. Everyone picked ridiculous amounts and tied them onto their packs. Obo was practically buried in them. They looked like a family of giant hedgehogs, though no one joked about it as the mood was getting bleak because everyone, even Ayram, was tired.
The first hand of the Tib was wonderful, for the perfectly flat and solid ground was a welcome change from the gently rising and falling stretches before. But this pleasure did not outlive the noon-day sun. The rocks underfoot were hot enough to blister bare skin, a toe was burned even if it slipped off the shoe for a single step.
More than any other part of the desert, the Tib was endless. They walked it, heading south and east, and after two days nothing changed. It was always the same endless black plain and empty sky. 
They tried to sleep two hands every night because they were too exhausted to walk right through it. And they had to sleep huddled around twiggy fires made from their stick bushes. It wasn’t the heat that provided comfort, though the nights were cold, it was the smell, for suspended above these miniature fires were tin bowls filled with a scented wax, smelling of carrion. In the mornings, the hardened wax would be thick with the fuzzy brown bodies of cusiloe flies, who’d been looking for meat in which to implant their eggs.
The flies live just under the Tib's skin, squeezed deep into the crevices of the interlocking rocks, and the odor of flesh, living or otherwise, drew them from hibernation—but only at night. Like reasonable creatures, they wouldn’t come out to bake in the sun. As soon as the red lip of the sun peeks up in the east, everyone rose and checked themselves to make sure they hadn’t been impregnated. If a fly did get under the skin, and the eggs were allowed to hatch, removing them would be a painful ordeal. Seb described the larvae—pulsing white thumbs with two fangs the length of fingernails. Pull them out and they can rip the flesh and leave a hole that will get infected. 
She said, “You look for them by feeling.”
She said this because skin was too dark to see the soft little welts, especially Moto’s and Moteah's skin. They all had to feel around for a hardened, coin-sized bump, like a callous on the palm. They had to check every inch of their bodies, and since no one can reach their own back, someone else had to do it.
Moteah and Moto checked each other. Ayram and Elrahet checked each other. Mandri was paired with Seb. Neither were happy about the arrangement. Mandri complained about Seb’s borcandi stained fingers. Seb was worried, perhaps rightly so, that Mandri might miss a spot. 
Nobody checked Obo. He said the flies wouldn’t bother him. If they did, he would know.
Before setting off they’d scrape the paste of dead flies from the surface of the wax and save them for food. Then they’d be on their way again, a short sprint in the half-light hours, before the sun became unbearable, and when the sun became unbearable they’d stop, pitch little shelters, and rest until the worst of the heat had passed.
It was a lurching way to travel, and it felt to Mandri that they made no progress. Two more days passed and still the scenery did not change.
To the north, a flat plain of pebbles for as far as the eye could see.
To the south, a flat plain of pebbles for as far as the eye could see.
To the east and to the west it was the same—flat for as far as the eye could see.
For all he knew they were going in a giant circle.
He began to study the chaotic patterns in the cracks on the floor. Once or twice he saw a dotted triangle of lighter pebbles that he’d swore he saw the day before.
Moving like this, out of rhythm and in unfamiliar hours, skating on the surface of an endless black stone sea, changed his perception of time. There were no new spikes of memory around which a moment could congeal. No new sounds, and no new conversations, because the heat of the day and the cold of night tempered everyone into the same person— short responses, shrugging shoulders, faces set in the same tight-lipped frown that said, “I just want to get through it”. And that’s who everyone was, bundled, muddled balls of just-get-through-it.
Except for Obo, of course. Obo remained genial and solicitous.
Everyone hated him.</Text>

            <Title>Capitalist Realism</Title>
            <Text>As Marx and Engels themselves observed in The Communist Manifesto, [Capital] has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom — Free Trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation. 

Capitalism is what is left when beliefs have collapsed at the level of ritual or symbolic elaboration, and all that is left is the consumer-spectator, trudging through the ruins and the relics. 

'We live in a contradiction,' Badiou has observed: 
a brutal state of affairs, profoundly inegalitarian - where all existence is evaluated in terms of money alone - is presented to us as ideal. To justify their conservatism, the partisans of the established order cannot really call it ideal or wonderful. So instead, they have decided to say that all the rest is horrible. Sure, they say, we may not live in a condition of perfect Goodness. But we're lucky that we don't live in a condition of Evil. Our democracy is not perfect. But it's better than the bloody dictatorships. Capitalism is unjust. But it's not criminal like Stalinism. We let millions of Africans die of AIDS, but we don't make racist nationalist declarations like Milosevic. We kill Iraqis with our airplanes, but we don't cut their throats with machetes like they do in Rwanda, etc. 




In their account of capitalism, surely the most impressive since Marx's, Deleuze and Guattari describe capitalism as a kind of dark potentiality which haunted all previous social systems. Capital, they argue, is the 'unnamable Thing', the abomination, which primitive and feudal societies 'warded off in advance'. When it actually arrives, capitalism brings with it a massive desacralization of culture. It is a system which is no longer governed by any transcendent Law; on the contrary, it dismantles all such codes, only to re-install them on an ad hoc basis 


like postmodern culture in general, Cobain found himself in 'a world in which stylistic innovation is no longer possible, [where] all that is left is to imitate dead styles, to speak through the masks and with the voices of the styles in the imaginary museum'. Here, even success meant failure, since to succeed would only mean that you were the new meat on which the system could feed. But the high existential angst of Nirvana and Cobain belongs to an older moment; what succeeded them was a pastiche-rock which reproduced the forms of the past without anxiety 

In the end, it was precisely hip hop's performance of this first version of the real - 'the uncompromising' - that enabled its easy absorption into the second, the reality of late capitalist economic instability, where such authenticity has proven highly marketable. Gangster rap neither merely reflects pre-existing social conditions, as many of its advocates claim, nor does it simply cause those conditions, as its critics argue - rather the circuit whereby hip hop and the late capitalist social field feed into each other is one of the means by which capitalist realism transforms itself into a kind of anti-mythical myth 




So long as we believe (in our hearts) that capitalism is bad, we are free to continue to participate in capitalist exchange. According to Žižek, capitalism in general relies on this structure of disavowal. We believe that money is only a meaningless token of no intrinsic worth, yet we act as if it has a holy value. M 


The most Gothic description of Capital is also the most accurate. Capital is an abstract parasite, an insatiable vampire and zombiemaker; but the living flesh it converts into dead labor is ours, and the zombies it makes are us. There is a sense in which it simply is the case that the political elite are our servants; the miserable service they provide from us is to launder our libidos, to obligingly re-present for us our disavowed desires as if they had nothing to do with us. 


Many of the teenage students I encountered seemed to be in a state of what I would call depressive hedonia. Depression is Usually characterized as a state of anhedonia, but the condition I'm referring to is constituted not by an inability to get pleasure so much as it by an inability to do anything else except pursue pleasure. 

Ask students to read for more than a couple of sentences and many - and these are A-level students mind you - will protest that they can't do it. The most frequent complaint teachers hear is that it's boring. It is not so much the content of the written Material that is at issue here; it is the act of reading itself that is deemed to be 'boring'. What we are facing here is not just time- honored teenage torpor, but the mismatch between a post-literate 'New Flesh' that is 'too wired to concentrate' and the confining, concentrational logics of decaying disciplinary systems. T 

An illustration: I challenged one student about why he always wore headphones in class. He replied that it didn't matter, because he wasn't actually playing any music. In another lesson, he was playing music at very low volume through the headphones, without wearing them. When I asked him to switch it off, he replied that even he couldn't hear it. Why wear the headphones without playing music or play music without wearing the headphones? Because the presence of the phones on the ears or the knowledge that the music is playing (even if he couldn't hear it) was a reassurance that the matrix was still there, within reach

            <Title>BURGEONSCRATCH</Title>
            <Text> in the shadow of the tower, was Ayram and Elrahet, and further out, prancing on the glowing red-orange sand was the white horse and it’s grey-robed rider, who cradled a black-robed child.

Flowing out of them all was goldness, purpose made maniefst, and this goldness was swimming under the sand, churning in the tower’s shadow and breathing out the tower itself. It sparkled the stone of the window-sill under Mandri’s fingers


The figures below were stuck in dynamic, limb-bent postures, seemingly fixed by the golden thread into a golden pyramidal frame—Ayram and Elrahet anchored bottom corners, the scribe on his white horse towered into a point. This was true purpose here, not to be mistaken for mere symbolism, no, the scribe, he did not represent Hrkan power advantaged on a proud steed, he was that power, and in his lap was the Riga child, the very embodiment of Hrk’s assault on the sanctity of creation. Ayram was not a symbol of the outland peoples, he was their paragon, and standing next to him was Elrahet, who was herself the very essence of the Sand given agency. Lying on the ground, woven into the middle of this golden triangle, was the Mazyd Obo, a creature constructed for the sole purpose of setting the affairs of humanity in order, and look where he was, destitute in the dirt, scarred and cowering and naked. The others looked past him as if he weren’t there at all.

He was forced instead imprint the scene upon his mind as best he could. He kept his eye jumping from detail to detail and back again, and then back again, and again, and again, and at each stop he beheld the object, an act beyond mere noticing—this was the artist's noticing, the lover's noticing, covetous noticing, jealous noticing, noticing to remember—beholding not a lossless art, but what gets lost has chance of being reconstructed later.

He ran through it all like a shopping list.
The arc of the tower’s shadow splitting the scene in half. 
The coolness of color inside that shadow and its subtle, sumptuous greys, almost looking blue.
The size disparity between Ayram and Elrahet—both dark and shrouded in that tower’s shadow. 
The Hrkan horse, Sol’s light, what a specimen—white as chalk. It’s brushed muscles glistened in the light of the sun. It’s neck as wide as Ayram’s shoulders. It’s eyes were as wide as a scream. It’s tail, impatient, was richly braided.
Sitting in the brown saddle was the Hrkan scribe, his dark skin reddened and glistening with kell oil. The trail of his grey robe was filigreed with golden leaves. His right arm cradled the black-bundled Riga with care. 
Obo on the ground. Pale. Fly-swatted. Staring at the sky. So perfect was the staging that the warm spectral edge of the tower's penumbra cut right across his stomach. 
The rest of the world—the tower bricks, the mush of rock and sand—these were static things and could be ignored because they could be revisited later. It was an injustice, abstracting them out as if they weren't bound by the golden thread and contributing to the moment’s purpose, but Mandri knew it was more than he could manage.
He ran through the details again. 
The arc of the tower’s shadow—that hadn't changed.
Ayram and Elrahet still stood resolute.
The horse hadn’t even shifted it’s weight. It’d been standing on two feet this whole time. Wonderful. 

He noticed a new detail—the white line of Hrkan soldiers hanging in the distance. It would take a large canvas to accommodate them. A lot of paint. He twinged at the thought having to fill up so large a frame.

Should he include the golden light of purpose? How to paint it? It wasn’t as simple as a shaft of light or an ephemeral back-lit rim of gold, it was more like a pulsing mist, and yet, not like a mist at all.
He would have to worry about that later. The details need accounting.
A new detail—Ayram’s spear—how had he missed it? , for the dark tip of that spear formed an unsightly tangent with the horse’s dark leather stirrup, such that the stirrup and accompanying harness seemed to sprout out from the haft. This element would need to be fixed. It flattened the image. Mandri could adjust the angle of the bar in Ayram’s hand so that it needn’t intersect with the stirrup at all.
Would it be sacrilegious to alter this image in any way?
Was the angle of the spear part of the purpose?
Did he miss anything?

Mandri wished there wasn’t there, because a vulture circling the scene was almost too on the nose. People might start to think that this was all his own doing. Maybe he should remove the vulture.

            <Title>Natron Flat</Title>
            <Text>The next day they came to a natron flat two miles long and as many wide. Seb broke off small chunks of the white stuff and rubbed it on her few remaining teeth. She said it had medicinal properties. Mandri knew it for its use in pigments. A tiny amount mixed in with quartz sand and copper ore made a blue called Campor Blue, called as such because the most vibrant hues came from Campor, where more than a hundred slaves spent their days sorting the quartz sand for impurities grain by grain with tweezers. Only the cleanest, purest grains of crystal were worthy.
Moteah found this fact distasteful instead of impressive. Mandri was quick to agree. Obo didn’t much care.
They crossed the flat without incident.</Text>

The two demons looked at each other. A whispered word was shared.
The first of them asked, “Why?”
The other asked, “Whatchu gawtta knife fur?”
Mandri looked down and saw that he was gripping his knife so tight that his knuckles were white. 
“Oh...uh…sorry.”
The demon from Iskabat pulled his short sword from its scabbard and he brandished it at Mandri. 
He said, “Cuhm an get dem feengahs cut.”
Mandri stepped back and waved his hands in clear submission. He said, “I’m here because Pel sent me.”
“Pel sent you?” the Jeketian demon asked.
Mandri nodded.
“What’s your name?”
“Mandrameen.”
The Iskabati demon grunted and the Jeketian slouched back against the gate. Evidently, they had been expecting him.
The Iskabati waved his sword and said, “Poop thuh lil’ hippy.”
“What?”
“Drop the knife,” said the Jeketian.
“Why?”
“Are you dumb? You’re not getting inside with a knife.”
It seemed unwise to give up the knife. If Mandri handed it over and passed through the gate he’d be ambling into the clutches of a Salavan without the means to defend himself.
Probably, he would die. 
But what good was a Mandri wielded knife against a demon king?
He’d die with or without it.
He could run away.
But where would he go? He would probably die in a gutter within a week.</Text>

            <Title>Pain</Title>
            <Text>One religion is True and the rest are False. This categorization satisfies most instincts, but some aren’t content with a simple dichotomy so they further divide the world’s religions through a rigorous analysis of the similarities and differences of belief and behavior.
Solitants come specially prepared for battle in this arena. When they proselytize to the fractured, they open with the observation that every religion in existence begins with a story that explains the origin of suffering. The Supine Cult believes that there are two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter. The Bavainu believe that suffering is a result of one’s own evil acts, or one’s ancestors. The Shell Kings believe that suffering is a symptom of Shellkhashar, which is a kind of spiritual disease which dulls virtuous instinct. There are a hundred more religions, each with a hundred variations, and in every instance, the story of suffering’s arrival is accompanied by a solution for it. The Supine Cult entreats their followers to lay down and pray their energy into the sky to make it stronger, for that is where the righteousness dwells. The Bavainu say that if you live rightly and follow their ancient laws, your life will be a happy one. The Shell Kings recommend drinking the blood of a willing virgin mixed with a mind melting toxin found in a sea snail’s shell. Every religion has its own solution to suffering, they’re all in that category, every one of them is peddling relief—all of them except for the Solitants.
The Solitants offer no solution to life’s troubles. &quot;We’re the only ones who believe that suffering is not something to fear,&quot; a Solitant priest will say. 
&quot;Suffering is what this is all about!&quot;
He or she then smiles, and the smile accentuates the self-inflicted scar on their cheek which marks the rite of initiation into Solitant orders. Some Solitants can't get enough of it, and they smile underneath a mask of scars.
&quot;Life is suffering&quot;, they say. &quot;Try to suffer without suffering.&quot; They laugh because it doesn’t make any sense. Truly, the Divine Spark is like a block of sculptor's stone. It is clean, abstract, inert, featureless—and then comes the sculptor's chisel. As the chisel carves away at the stone to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the person. What troubles our fleshy vessels is what makes us who we are. Solitants are artists of the Self and their chisel is pain. Solraheen guides the hammer.
Typical Hrkan speech has only the one word—pain. If a person says, “I am in pain,” there’s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe, or did a loved one just die? Have their bowels been blocked for days? The word ‘pain’ can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are using the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The words ‘anguish’, ‘ache’, ‘soreness’, ‘irritation’, and ‘misery’ all approach different things, but they’re not nearly enough to cover the spectrum.
The intrepid Solitant, with linguistic flair, goes as far as to claim that the very structure of Hrkan speech stunts the growth of pain appreciation, because the mind cannot develop a sensitivity to certain flavors of agony if the world is divided up into subject, verb, and object, for when the Self is disassociated from the action and the cause, grand vistas of becoming remain hidden from sight.
In Mandrameen’s view, pain was best expressed through the natural language of gesture, as Solraheen intended. In breadth of expression, the face is far, far superior to the Solitant’s rule-governed, rasping utterances. Of what use is a fuzzy word when you can see the pain written on the face clear as day? Observe the eye and brow of a person in pain—is there languor, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience, anxiety? Is the skin knit tight, is it smooth, is it beaded with sweat? Is the eye’s lid puffy or hollow? Are the cheeks wet or dry, dark or pale, sallowing brown, or purple, or yellow? Then there’s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up into the face. The lower back knots up, the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, and finally the lips draw tight and the teeth gnash. A trained eye can look at another in pain and know, without words, the entirety of their inner world. The holy language of the Solitants is redundant, and no argument could convince Mandri otherwise.
Until now.
The pain from the demon bite in his thigh was so intense that the slightest pressure elicited a scream. The skin around the already black wound was taut and throbbing, a drumhead reverberating pain. Moto tried to make him walk, but that was impossible, so Moto carried him. He tossed Mandrameen atop his pack, and with each step that Moto took, Mandri’s raw wound chafed against Moto’s shoulder, sending a fresh wave of excruciating pain into Mandri’s groin and hip.
Moto trotted along the Pitted Portion, and every now and then he expressed his unconcern with an annoyed snort. Since Mandri lacked the word to adequately describe the nature of his pain, he was forced to make one up. After a particularly brutal fit, he stiffened up and screamed, “EeeauuughhhGoddamnyousonofahukgukuk!”
“Shut up,” said Moto. “You did this to yourself.”
“You shit!” screamed Mandri. “You-uueeauughhhhh!”
You-uueeauughhhhh was no exaggeration. If Moto had the ear for it, he would have stopped and immediately administered the most tender care. Instead, he kept on walking, and Mandri fainted again from the torture.
Mandri woke up several hands later to a clear night sky of starry black. Chattering voices swirled around his barely conscious mind. He assumed that one of those voices was Moto’s. Maybe one of them was his. The only thing he knew for certain was that he was still bouncing atop Moto’s shoulders, still marching through the Sand. By now his leg was numb, and he could feel the demon’s poison gnawing at his chest, constricting his heart and lungs. Every breath was a labor. He fainted again.
He woke up the next day when Moto leaned back and dropped Mandri from a height like a camel dropping dung. Mandri landed hard on his wounded thigh and he let loose a gargled curse, and tried to find some twist of hip and spine that could give him relief, finally laying all the way back and shifting most of his weight onto his right ass cheek. Mandri’s reeling mind found the space to understand that he was still alive and that feeling had returned to his extremities. He could breathe. He was not dead. Damn it all.
Through the demon-clawed hole in his robe he could see that his affected thigh had been poulticed and bandaged, though it was poorly done, as the brown woolen wraps were ragged and splitting apart. A few sturdy threads were all that was holding the spongy dried-green weeds together. 
He looked up and saw that the reason Moto dropped him was because they’d arrived at some accursed destination—an enormous black rock sitting in the middle of a flat and barren sandy landscape.
Mandri was astonished by the sight of it. It wasn’t just any big rock, it was a single uncracked rock. Rocks that big in the Sand tend to look like old, slumping things that have been half-melted by the sun, but this rock, this biggest of all boulders, was a healthy, oblong rock. And more astonishing was that it balanced above the Sand on its belly. So unnatural and precarious was its position that it seemed a strong blast of wind should be able to pick the whole thing up and send it tumbling along the desert floor. Mandri felt that if he stood next to it and gave a hearty push, he could get it rolling. 
Sitting as it was in an empty desert landscape, with no other rocky eminence in sight, well, that made it seem like the rock had been deliberately placed there by the hand of Solraheen. Surely, it was a holy site.
Moto was stooped over a big pile of the Ayramun’s haulings. Evidently everyone else had simply tossed their stuff together before heading off to who knows where. Mandri looked for a pit, but there was none that he could see. There were only two other Ayramun present, dour looking men, milling about the pack heap. Moto unstrapped his own pack and tossed on top of the others.
He asked the two millers, in an accusing tone, “What are you two doing?”
“We’ve been looking for you,” said one of them, a Zosan whose only distinguishing feature was a polished brass hoop wrapped tight around his neck.
“Looks to me like you've been tickling dick,” Moto replied. 
“We got told to look for you, and here we are, lookin right at you.”
Moto nodded towards Mandri and said, “Well, now you can look at him. Make sure he doesn’t go and do something stupid.”
“How about we take you to Ayram, as we been ordered to do.”
Moto shrugged and said, “Lead on.”
The three men walked off towards the giant black rock. They walked around it, and then disappeared.
Mandri wasn’t so concerned about where they went because he was busy nursing that meager relief that he’d twisted himself into.
He decided then that he well and truly hated Moto. This was more than the flippant hate he doled out to everyone and no one in particular. He tried to recall the words to an Old Jandri curse that could kill a callous man Moto, but the pain in his leg was a powerful amnestic. He then set about preparing the ground around him so that he could more comfortably wallow in his self-pity. Eventually, he decided to shimmy over to the pile of packs so that he could lean against it and watch that enigmatic rock, and as soon as he did, something on the other side of the pile groaned, right from where those dullards had been standing earlier.
Mandri crawled up onto the pile of packs towards the sound. Thankfully, this pile was a remarkably comfortable assortment of squishy bags, and once on top of the heap he spied the thing that made the noise—a lump of dusty black rags laying in the sand a few feet away. 
Mandri dragged himself closer to get a better look. He was careful not to disrupt the tenuous peace he’d negotiated between himself and the wound in his thigh. As soon as the pain flared up he stopped moving altogether. He nestled his elbow into a bag of grain, and let his hip sink gently into an inside-out goat bladder stuffed with jerky. Now that he was comfortably reclined, he was free to annoy that pile of rags just below him. They were Mazidobo’s rags, and the lump they covered was the right size for a handless, legless, Mazid.
Mandri felt around for something to poke Obo with. His searching fingers settled on an empty waterskin. He threw it at Obo, and the limp waterskin flapped harmlessly off the shrouded lump and dropped with a slap into the sand.
“I know you’re there,” Mandri said.
He waited, but no response came.
Mandri dug around in the pile for something else to throw. He was so tickled by all the little outland trinkets, stone beads, thumbstick idols of gods he didn’t know, that he almost didn’t register the dull, snapping crack of bone as Obo’s black rags twitched then went silent.
“You okay?” he asked the rags, but again, there was no answer.
Out of the pile, Mandri pulled a tight ball of twine. He tossed it underhand, and when it landed on that pile of rags they sighed. A moment later another crack of bone sounded out and the rags twitched again, but this time Obo’s jerking loosed a strap of robe to reveal his pale shoulder. Mandri watched, half in terror, half in curiosity as Obo’s pale and hairless head emerged from that mass of tattered robes.
“Hello, Mandri.”
Obo suddenly sat up, and his robes fell away to reveal a scrawny, bruised, and broken body. Mandri had seen some awful sights, but watching this pale Mazid use his blood-nub of an arm to find and fix a dislocated rib was something else entirely. And judging by the sorry state of Obo’s ragged robes, and the bloody abrasions splotching his rawbone shoulders, he hadn’t been carried through the desert like Mandri, he’d been dragged along its floor. 
Despite all the abuse, Obo’s mood was ordinary. He sat up and stretched what was left of his arms and legs as if he were a cat waking up from a nap. He twisted around to draw out the kinks of his spine, and as he did, Mandri noticed a thin scar running all the way up the middle of his back. It was a seam, as if Obo’s skin were somehow sewn onto his flesh, and this seam split at the base of his skull and circled around his ears. Then Obo’s stretch suddenly popped every single vertebrae in rapid succession, causing Mandri’s own spine to stiffen in sympathetic fright, a sudden jerk that unleashed a fresh wave of torture radiating out of his thigh.
He yelped. Obo smiled like a beerbat.
“What are you smiling at?” Mandri asked.
“I’m happy to have some company that doesn’t want to ruin me.”
Obo took up his robes in his mouth and scooted himself closer to the pile of the Ayramun’s packs, and as he leaned himself up against them, he caught Mandri staring at his drawn-and-quartered body. He spat out his robe and covered himself up as if it were a blanket.
Obo said quietly, “You should save that anxious look for yourself. I smell death on you. You are rushing up on corpsehood quite quickly.” He adjusted the folds of his robe.
Mandri looked down at his poorly poulticed leg and said, “I think I made it through the worst of it. Last night I could hardly breathe, but now I can breathe just fine.”
“What happened?”
“You won’t believe me.”
“I might.”
“I was bit by a demon.”
“A demon?”
“I said you wouldn’t believe me.”
“You’ve been seeing a lot of demons lately.”
“Now I’ve seen one for real. I thought they were all gone to be honest.”
“When you first saw me, you thought I was a demon. I think it’s worth appreciating that there is always a distinction between what you see, and your interpretation of what you see.”
Mandri winced hard as the pain in his leg reared and seared.
“You should let me look at the wound,” said Obo.
“Why?”
Obo shrugged. “I may be able to do something for the pain. I won’t know for sure unless I see it first.”
Mandri paused to consider. Despite Obo’s calm and generally amicable demeanor, there was no getting past the fact that Obo looked like a creature who wriggled around in caves. Obo’s ugly paleness was upsetting enough, but the absence of eyebrows, those signposts of the Spark, made it impossible to ascertain the intentions hidden behind his shine-silver eyes. 
But the pain in Mandri’s leg was stupid, and Mandri couldn’t think of many things worse than something stupid that refuses to go away, so he huffed and puffed and rolled himself down to where Obo sat. Once he made himself as comfortable as he could be, he rolled up the hem of his robe, and that’s when fear took hold of him.
Above his knee, all the many veins in his thigh ran black as ink, and nearer to the loose poultice, those black veins were bulging above his pallid skin like nightworms.
“Sol’s light,” Mandri muttered.
He gingerly unwrapped the long strip of wool that held the poultice in place. The various weedy leaves and lichens that composed the meat of the poultice were moist and spongy, and he was able to flick most of it into his open palm easily enough, but the rest he had to pluck, for the pulped leaf stems closer to the flesh were caked in a gooey dark-brown emulsion of infected blood and poultice paste.
“Try to clean it up,” said Obo.
“What do you think I’m doing.”
Mandri kept picking until all that was left was the terrifying sight of a day-old demon bite. The edges of this fang-scalloped wound were festering and black, and this jagged ring of necrotic flesh enclosed a puddle of that brown emulsion, which had, in parts, been scraped away to reveal the red-raw muscle of his thigh.
Opening the wound to the air reinvigorated it. Though the pain was extreme, it still looked worse than it felt. What really got Mandri worried was how his inky black veins spidered up his thigh and in towards his crotch.
“Let’s see the full extent of it”, Obo said as he leaned over the affected area.
“No. I don’t want to know what my uglies look like.”
“How does your chest feel?
Mandri looked at Obo very carefully. “Hurry up and do what you’re gonna do.”
Obo studied the wound with an impassive gaze, eyes darting from detail to detail, as if he were a dealer appraising an old vase and the particular texture and color of a scab could help him determine authenticity.
“Hurry up,” said Mandri.
Eventually Obo pulled back and said flatly, “I can’t do anything for you.”
“What?”
“That is the strangest bite wound I’ve ever seen. I’m half inclined to believe your story.”
“You said you could help with the pain.”
“Did I?”
“Don’t tell me you lied.”
“A Mazid never lies.”
“Oxshit, you lie all the time.” Mandri slapped the weedy poultice back onto his wound, and he did his best to re-roll that ragged strip of wool around it. When he was done, he leaned back against the mound of packs.
“Do you know what this place is?” Mandri finally asked, nodding towards the giant black rock.
“I overheard an Ayramun call it Minting Rock.”
“Wonder why it’s called that.”
“The name suggests it’s a place for these bandits to mint counterfeit coins away from prying eyes. But I’ve seen such places before and this one is different.”
“How so?”
“For one, most illegal mints are hidden near a spring. There is no spring here, so far as I can tell. And this rock, it’s too imposing to be a mere bandit’s den. It possesses a numinous beauty.”
“It does, doesn’t it? As if it were thrown down from the heavens. If it were blacker than it is, I’d call it a boulder of Fabled Black.”
“It’s not that. It’s granite.”
“I would say it’s a holy site, but these Ayramun are too crude for it. Especially Moto. The man is an ass. The man is a donkey wearing human skin.”
“My admittedly limited impression of the man was that he was one of the smarter ones.”
Mandri sighed and tried to calm himself by pulling out a small bag of spicy jerked beef from the mound of things. He popped one of these slips of beef into his mouth and tucked it into his cheek to let its flavors fix him. He said, “Moto’s not smart. He can speak well enough, but that doesn’t mean anything. He’s as dumb as the rest of them.”
“They’re not so bad.”
“I couldn’t disagree more. They’re cruel. That’s an easy way to know if someone is stupid—are they cruel? Look at what they’ve done to you.”
“I don’t know,” said Obo, wiggling his stumps under his rags. “I think that Ayram was right to do what he did.”
Mandri was waiting for a sarcastic wink but it never came.
“He chopped off your legs,” he said bitterly.
“And I’m thankful he showed such restraint,” said Obo. Still no wink.
Mandri chewed the jerky because he would scream from the pain in his leg if he didn’t. “You’ll never be able to walk again,” he said.
“Should I be angry about that?”
“Yes! You should! I’m angry for you. I tell you what, I’ll hate the Ayramun for the both of us. They deserve it for what they’ve done to me—and you.”
“I thought a demon did that to you.”
Mandri wagged his finger at Obo’s nose and said, “If that ass Moto didn’t tie me up and throw me into a lizard pit, I never would have been bit. Believe me, these people are half-demons themselves.”
“They’re only cruel because the Sand is cruel. If you’d been caught up by Kalemites, you’d have been eaten, and the one to consume your stomach would today be wearing your sacrum strapped onto his forehead.”
“I would have preferred that,” Mandri said with a wry grin.
“Maybe,” said Obo, dryly. “But the pain will pass, one way or another.”
Mandri shrugged, and the pair of them continued to sit in silence. Mandri chewed his way to the bottom of the small bag of jerky, when Obo, out of nowhere, said, “Mandri, do you hate me?”
The Mazid’s face was completely sincere. He asked again, “Do you hate Mazidai?”
Mandri kept chewing his last bit of beef, savoring the unfamiliar blend of spices. Some strange pepper in it. Definitely a heap of salt. He was getting thirsty now. He’d like some water. He shrugged and said, “I’ve only got enough hate in me for all of humanity.”
“Is that so?”
“There’s not any left over for a Mazid that’s been cut down to size. You’ve got no arms or legs so, it’s not like you can do anything to me—or anyone for that matter.”
“I’ve still got my Mazidfire.”
“Yeah, but you can’t control it, can you? I mean if you really want—” Mandri paused to lick his fingers. “If you really want, I could hate you a little bit.”
“I was hoping we could be friends instead.”
Mandri laughed, “You’re serious?”
“I am.”
“Well, a little hatred won’t get in the way of a good friendship. I don’t know if you know this, but friendship doesn’t actually require us to like each other.”
“I was under the impression that it did.”
“You’d be wrong.”
“How does that work? I thought the purpose of friendship was to make life less miserable.”
“That’s one way of putting it. Put another way, it’s an exchange of comfort predicated on self-interest. We don’t actually need to like each other to do that. Believe me, friendship—true friendship like you’re thinking of—it’s an illusion. It doesn’t exist. When one half starts to suffer, the other half stops lending comfort as soon as it becomes inconvenient. Like if it’s too much trouble for you to help me out, you’ll be gone. Don’t look so glum, it goes both ways.”
“It seems simpler to say that the one friend who gives up on the other wasn’t a friend to begin with than to deny the whole concept of friendship altogether.”
“You say that, but… I’ll put it this way, I’ve never actually seen a person willing to sacrifice something meaningful, against their own interest, in a time of need. Unless it’s for family. Family blood makes people insane.”
“I would disagree, but only because I can’t challenge your own experiences with my own as I have none to share.”
“Obo, you’ve never had a true friend because they don’t exist. But let’s not get caught up in semantics here—if you’re too attached to the word ‘friendship’, we can call it something else. Let’s call it hateship. You and I, we have a budding hateship.”
“If you hate me as a person, then I accept, because most people don’t even consider me to be a person.”
Mandri groaned at Obo’s clumsy appeal for pity, and he said, “Oh, come on.”
“What?”
“You’re laying it on way too thick, Obo.”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“You might be able to fool these outland pokes, but I’m a different breed.”
“I don’t know what you mean,” Obo repeated.
“Let’s see—you don’t feel pain, you don’t feel anger, and I very much doubt you feel compassion. You’ve already tried to run away from these pokes once, but you were caught and got your legs chopped off. You’re not talking to me right now because you want a friend. What you’re doing is you’re scheming, and your schemes would stand better chances if you had arms and legs, but since you don’t have any, I’m the next best thing. You can’t exactly go running off into the Sand, but I can!”
“You can run on that leg?”
“Well, no. It’s the principle of it.”
“You must be the most skeptical creature that ever breathed a thought.”
“Am I wrong?”
“I do feel compassion.”
“I’ve seen a Mazid kill a hundred-score in a heartbeat.”
“When?”
“The massacre of Gudrk.”
“Gudrk was two hundred years ago.”
“I saw it in a painting.”
“Of course,” said Obo with a scoff.
“But am I wrong? You say you never lie, so answer me that—am I wrong?”
“Wrong about what?”
“That the only reason you’re talking to me is because you want to use me for whatever escape you’re scheming up.”
Obo paused to consider his words carefully.
“It’s a simple yes or no,” said Mandri.
Obo tilted his head back and forth as if to weigh some heavy decision.
“How should I say this...”
“By saying yes, or no.”
“I’ll say this—I am talking to you because I wish to explore the potential of our relationship.”
“Uh-huh.”
“I have no plans.”
“Now that is a lie.”
“I have no plans yet,” said Obo with a mischievous grin. “First I have to discover what Ayram wants with me.”
“Isn’t it obvious?”
“Not particularly, no.”
“These are outland pokes, Obo. What does every outland poke want? To a man and woman, they want Hrk destroyed. And you’re a Mazid. You possess the most destructive power known to man. They captured you because they want to use you against your masters. That’s why Ayram was so upset when his girl couldn’t control you.”
“If that is Ayram’s plan then it will fail and he will die. I’m certain there is more to it.”
“If that’s true, they won’t admit it to me. They won’t even tell me why I’m out here.”
“That is strange, isn't it? I’ve been trying to figure out your role in all of this. These Ayramun aren’t in a position to accommodate a freeloader, so I don’t understand why they would haul you around, or why they brought you back from the dead in the first place.”
“Probably some old desert superstition,” Mandri said, thinking back to the old demon witch who’d started this all in the first place.
“That’s what I thought too,” said Obo. “But superstition will only carry you so far with these people. I’d like to give you some advice, as a friend—try and make yourself useful. I know that will be difficult, considering your injury, but you have to try.”
“And what about you?”
“Don’t worry about me.”
Suddenly, Obo’s attention was jerked towards Minting Rock. Mandri looked and saw nothing but the rock itself—Though he knew that must be stirring because Obo could hear things, perhaps see things, that nobody else could. Mandri tried to discern if it was good or bad news by studying Obo’s gaunt face as he strained his preternatural senses. But Obo’s blank face gave nothing away unless he wanted it to. 
“The stage is set,” Obo finally said. “We will have to hold the discussion here.”Without a word of clarification, Obo stuffed the hem of his tattered robe into his mouth and stump-shuffled himself back to the spot where he lay before. He plopped himself down flat and then covered himself back up with his black tatters so that it looked like he’d never moved at all.
He gave Mandi one last whisper, muffled through folds of his robe, “Pretend that we never spoke.”
“Yeah, I gathered that.”
Then there came a loud whistle from the direction of Minting Rock, a fingers in the mouth whistle, bright as a bright-beak’s call.
A heartbeat later, and people began to tumble out from around Minting Rock’s belly. First one, then three, then seven of them, and then the giant Ayram. Each in turn took off jogging towards Mandri and the pile of dumped goods.
The first to reach him was the short, brusque man named Hill. Hill pushed Mandri over, casually ignoring Mandri’s agonized hoot. He picked up the pack that Mandri had been laying against. He then gave Mandri the most disapproving look, and he trotted back towards Minting Rock. The rest did much the same. Ayram was the only one to stay. He stood right over Mandri and his great big head and round bushy beard blotted out the sun.
Such was the man’s size that Mandri felt humbled, and humbling Mandri was no easy feat. No matter how big or intelligent someone seemed, it could never erase the fact that they were only human—an impulsive, excitable, self-interested human. Buried in the man’s shadow, Mandri looked up and saw all the familiar features of a man but did not match the pattern as a person. Ayram was greater. Somehow more solid. A reference point for being, like an old tree, or a father in the eyes of a son.
Ayram shouted, “Moto! Get over here!”
Moto was one of the Ayramun who’d been scrambling around, hauling all those packs towards Minting Rock. He was hugging a bulging sack of sand-dried beets when he heard Ayram shout his name. He immediately dropped the sack and jogged on over to see what the fuss was about.
Mandri was happy to see that Moto’s sense of control was gone. And there was a faint swipe-stain of blood from Mandri’s thigh on the shoulder of Moto’s formerly speckless garb.
“Explain,” Ayram said as he pointed to Mandri’s leg.
“It’s as I said. The boy got bit by a demon.”
“In the thigh?”
“He was trying to run away from me and he jumped into a lizard pit.”
“No I didn’t!” Mandri shouted. “The oaf threw me in!”
Ayram grunted at Mandri’s outburst, and Mandri found himself struck by a silly thought—this was the first time that Ayram had ever heard his voice. Ayram seemed to find it funny.
Ayram said to Moto, “Explain why this boy was running away from you.”
Moto shrugged his shoulders and shook his head as if he hadn’t the faintest idea. Ayram glared at him, clearly expecting an answer, so Moto prepared some bullshit about Mandri trying to escape. Mandri was familiar with the technique—when faced with real consequences, the whole body has got to get involved to sell the lie. All that powerful gesticulating, it wasn’t really about selling the lie, it was about Moto letting Ayram know that he was going to cause a fuss if he was called out on the lie, and if Ayram thought that fuss would be more trouble then the whole thing was worth, Moto might just get away with it. 
Moto finished by extending his arms all the way out to the sky and declared, “The boy’s an idiot! He doesn’t think. He’s got a dirty Spark. You should have seen it, the demon was chewing on his leg and he didn’t even try to fight the thing off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.”
Mandri knew he couldn’t speak out of turn so he was forced to resort to an incredulous gasp. With each word that Moto spoke, Mandrameen’s face scrunched up tighter and tighter—he made every effort short of squealing to let Ayram know that Moto was lying.
Ayram said to Moto, “You didn’t do what I told you to do.”
“How could I?” Moto griped. “Ask him whatever you want! The boy has no will to live.”
“We don’t have time for this. Take the Mazid.”
Moto walked slowly and deliberately to where Obo lay, pulled him up, tucked him under the arm, and then he took off towards Minting Rock, glaring at Mandri as he left.
 Ayram turned to Mandri. His arms were crossed and his fingers were tapping out his frustration against his elbows.
He said, “It was an ill omen, finding you dead in the hills. It took my witch a whole hand to convince me that your Spark was worth rekindling. When a man is brought back from the dead, sometimes, he comes back changed. Some come back corrupted. They’re agents of Shis. Is that what you are?”
The mention of Shis triggered in Mandri the memory of Salavan’s hidden basement, that black painting, and that black head. He tried to block these thoughts out of his mind because he felt that Ayram’s wild eyes were reading his thoughts.
“Can you walk?” asked Ayram.
“I can try,” Mandri answered.
Mandri rolled onto his stomach and pushed himself up onto his good knee, and from there, he stood up. His bad leg was as stiff as a board, though he was determined to walk on his own for he knew it would not go well for him if he couldn’t carry his own weight.
He took a step and shuddered.
He said, “I don’t think I can walk, but I might be able to hobble.”
Ayram nodded. “Make your way into the rock,” he said. He reached down and grabbed Mandri’s left arm and his gigantic fingers encircled the arm a whole half over. 
“It is good that you try to walk. A Shisgazok would make himself a burden.”
With Mandri steadied, Ayram let go, moved to retrieve the last items from the Ayramun’s pile, and then set off stomping, back towards Minting Rock.
Mandri hopped after him but he couldn’t keep up. His left leg still couldn’t bear even the slightest amount of weight. It felt like his thigh bone had splintered, and every shuffling hop sent sharp white shards stabbing into the meat of his thigh. But it was not a great distance, so he soldiered on.
As he went he thought of the Solitants and their sacred tortures. He wondered if they had a word for the particular arc of sensations that a demon bite inflicts. He wondered what this pain would do to him, what kind of man it would make him if he toughed it out.
He looked out over the empty Sand and recalled a heretical painting titled, ‘Oneness with the divine’. It depicted a flayed Solitant lying on a rack, his skin completely unwrapped from his body, his bare anatomy exposed to the haze of incense floating around the dark room. This mortification was a ritual performed by only the most schismatic of adherents, men and women who did not want to craft the Self, but tried instead to destroy it. The ritual was an attempt to confront the Self with the truth that there was no edge between it and the rest of reality. The logic here was as crude as the operation—as there is a natural inclination to see the skin as being the boundary of the Self, removing the skin would leave the Self with nothing to contain it.
Mandri always thought that the ecstasy depicted in Solitant's face was put there by the artist. It was not possible that a person could remain conscious through such an ordeal. And Mandri refused to accept that a ritual flensing could lead a person to righteousness. What kind of world would he be living in if that were true? Such a place could only be called Shis.
He stepped into the shadow of Minting Rock and pressed his hand against the rock’s cold belly. He pushed as hard as he could. He didn’t expect to be able to push it over, but he had to satisfy his curiosity. It really did seem that if he stood there long enough, the thing would roll over and squish him like a bug. 
The way inside was not cut into the rock itself but into the earth underneath it. This hole, this fissure, looked far too much like that drag-belly den, or rather, that demon’s den. Still, there was no way but forwards, so he hitched on downwards into the earth. This passage soon led him into a dead end of undressed stone stacked haphazardly like an old goatherd's fence. Above him, high up, was a circle of daylight. It seemed as if he were at the bottom of a dried-up well that had been carved all the way through the core of Minting Rock itself.
From above, a voice shouted, “Grab the rope!”
Mandri fumbled about in the darkness and his hand stumbled upon a rope. He took several deep breaths to battle the pain, then he held on tight as he was hauled up into the stomach of Minting Rock.</Text>

            <Title>Thomas More</Title>
            <Text>More’s utopia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aUXzBEVsTQ

In 1519, he wrote that More was &quot;born and designed for friendship; no one is more open-hearted in making friends or more tenacious in keeping them.&quot;[35] In 1535, after More's execution, Erasmus wrote that More &quot;never bore ill-intent towards anyone&quot;.[34]
&quot;We are 'together, you and I, a crowd'; that is my feeling, and I think I could live happily with you in any wilderness. Farewell, dearest Erasmus, dear as the apple of my eye.&quot;
— Thomas More to Erasmus, October 31, 1516[36]
&quot;When More died I seem to have died myself: because we were a single soul as Pythagoras once said. But such is the flux of human affairs.&quot;
— Erasmus to Piotr Tomiczki (Bishop of Kraków), August 31, 1535[37]

In a 1532 letter, Erasmus wrote &quot;such is the kindliness of his disposition, or rather, to say it better, such is his piety and wisdom, that whatever comes his way that cannot be corrected, he comes to love just as wholeheartedly as if nothing better could have happened to him.[38]
In a 1533 letter, Erasmus described More's character as imperiosus – commanding, far-ruling, not at all timid.[39]
For his part, &quot;Thomas More was an unflagging apologist for Erasmus for the thirty-six years of their adult lives (1499–1535).&quot;

Torture was not officially legal in England, except in pre-trial discovery phase of kinds of extreme cases that the King had allowed, such as seditious heresy. It was regarded as unsafe for evidence, and was not an allowed punishment. 

a child servant in his household who was caned (the customary punishment for children at that time) for repeating a heresy regarding the Eucharist, and a &quot;feeble-minded&quot; man who was whipped for disrupting the mass by raising women's skirts over their heads at the moment of consecration, More taking the action to prevent a lynching. 



John Tewkesbury was a London leather seller found guilty by the Bishop of London John Stokesley[note 10] of harbouring English translated New Testaments; he was sentenced to burning for refusing to recant. More declared: he &quot;burned as there was neuer wretche I wene better worthy.&quot;[74]
Richard Bayfield was found distributing Tyndale's Bibles, and examined by Bishop Cuthbert Tunstall. More commented that he was &quot;well and worthely burned&quot;.[20]: 305 
James Bainham was arrested on a warrant of Thomas More as Lord Chancellor and detained at his gatehouse. He was examined by Bishop John Stokesley, abjured, penalized and freed. He subsequently re-canted, and was re-arrested, tried and executed as a relapsed heretic.

Others have been more critical, such as writer Richard Marius, an American scholar of the Reformation, believing that such persecutions were a betrayal of More's earlier humanist convictions, including More's zealous and well-documented advocacy of extermination for Protestants.[70]: 386–406  This supposed contraction has been called &quot;schizophrenic.&quot;[49]: 108  He has been called a &quot;zealous legalist…(with an) itchy finesse of cruelty&quot;.[76] 

More's resignation as Lord Chancellor demonstrates also a recognition of the fact that, so long as he held office, he was obliged to conform to the King's law. It is often the fact that judges and lawyers must perform acts which they do not particularly like. In Utopia, for example, More had written that he believed capital punishment to be immoral, reprehensible and unjustifiable. Yet as Lord Chancellor and as councillor to the King, he certainly participated in sending hundreds of people to their death, a troubling thought. Doubtless he saw himself, as many judges before and since have done, as a mere instrument of the legal power of the State. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Meslier
 To him, religions were fabrications fostered by ruling elites; although the earliest Christians had been exemplary in sharing their goods, Christianity had long since degenerated into encouraging the acceptance of suffering and submission to tyranny as practised by the kings of France: injustice was explained away as being the will of an all-wise Being.[8] None of the arguments used by Meslier against the existence of God were original. In fact, he derived them from books written by orthodox theologians in the debate between the Jesuits, Cartesians, and Jansenists. Their inability to agree on a proof for God's existence was taken by Meslier as a good reason not to presume that there were compelling grounds for belief in God. 
Meslier later describes God as &quot;a chimera&quot; and argues that the supposition of God is not prerequisite to morality. In fact, he concludes that &quot;Whether there exists a God or not [...] men's moral duties will always be the same so long as they possess their own nature&quot;. 
Meslier also vehemently attacked social injustice and sketched out a kind of rural proto-communism.[9] All the people in a region would belong to a commune in which wealth would be held in common, and everybody would work. Founded on love and brotherhood, the communes would ally to help each other and preserve peace. 

An opponent of cruelty to animals, Meslier wrote that &quot;it is an act of cruelty, of barbarism, to kill, to strike unconscious, and to cut the throat of animals, who do no harm to anyone, the way we do.&quot; He considered the lack of compassion and concern by Christians for animal suffering at the hands of man to be, according to Matthieu Ricard, further proof of &quot;the nonexistence, or the malice, of their God.&quot; 

François Marie Charles Fourier (/ˈfʊrieɪ, -iər/;[1]French: [ʃaʁl fuʁje]; 7 April 1772 – 10 October 1837) was a French philosopher, an influential early socialist thinker, and one of the founders of utopian socialism. Some of his views, held to be radical in his lifetime, have become mainstream in modern society. For instance, Fourier is credited with having originated the word feminism in 1837.[2] 

Fourier characterized poverty (not inequality) as the principal cause of disorder in society, and proposed to eradicate it by sufficiently high wages and a &quot;decent minimum&quot; for those unable to work.[12] He used the word &quot;civilization&quot; in a pejorative sense; as such, &quot;Fourier's contempt for the respectable thinkers and ideologies of his age was so intense that he always used the terms philosopher and civilization in a pejorative sense. In his lexicon civilization was a depraved order, a synonym for perfidy and constraint ... Fourier's attack on civilization had qualities not to be found in the writing of any other social critic of his time.&quot;[13]
Fourier believed that there were 12 common passions, which resulted in 810 types of character, so the ideal phalanx would have 1,620 people.[15] One day there would be six million of these, loosely ruled by a world &quot;omniarch&quot;, or (later) a World Congress of Phalanxes. He had a concern for the sexually rejected; jilted suitors would be led away by a corps of fairies who would soon cure them of their lovesickness, and visitors could consult the card-index of personality types for suitable partners for casual sex. He also defended homosexuality as a personal preference for some people. Anarchist Hakim Bey describes Fourier's ideas as follows:
In Fourier's system of Harmony all creative activity including industry, craft, agriculture, etc. will arise from liberated passion—this is the famous theory of &quot;attractive labor.&quot; Fourier sexualizes work itself—the life of the Phalanstery is a continual orgy of intense feeling, intellection, &amp; activity, a society of lovers &amp; wild enthusiasts.[16]


Fourier said Jews were &quot;the leprosy and the ruin of the body politic&quot;. He criticized the government for being weak and &quot;prostrate&quot; when confronted with what he called a &quot;secret and indissoluble league&quot; of Jews. Post-Medieval antisemitic rhetoric often accused Jews of being unable to assimilate into a unitary national culture (highly valued by the French nationalists). Fourier was one of the writers to argue that Jews were disloyal and would not make good French citizens. Like others, he placed great significance on the religious restrictions prohibiting Jews from eating at the same table as non-Jews:[22]
he confined himself to sitting down at table and drinking; he refused to eat any of the dishes, because they were prepared by Christians. Christians have to be very patient to tolerate such impertinence. In the Jewish religion it denotes a system of defiance and aversion for other sects. Now, does a sect which wishes to carry its hatred as far as the table of its protectors, deserve to be protected?

            <Text>&quot;The child who is not embraced by the village, will burn it down to feel it's warmth&quot; - African proverb 


Jesus said, &quot;Let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds. When he finds, he will become troubled. When he becomes troubled, he will be astonished, and he will rule over the All.&quot; 

Jesus said, &quot;Blessed is the lion which becomes man when consumed by man; and cursed is the man whom the lion consumes, and the lion becomes man.&quot; 

) Jesus saw infants being suckled. He said to his disciples, &quot;These infants being suckled are like those who enter the kingdom.&quot; They said to him, &quot;Shall we then, as children, enter the kingdom?&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;When you make the two one, and when you make the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and when you make the male and the female one and the same, so that the male not be male nor the female; and when you fashion eyes in the place of an eye, and a hand in place of a hand, and a foot in place of a foot, and a likeness in place of a likeness; then will you enter the kingdom.&quot; 

) Jesus said, &quot;I took my place in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in flesh. I found all of them intoxicated; I found none of them thirsty. And my soul became afflicted for the sons of men, because they are blind in their hearts and do not have sight; for empty they came into the world, and empty too they seek to leave the world. But for the moment they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine, then they will repent.&quot; 

Jesus said, &quot;If the flesh came into being because of spirit, it is a wonder. But if spirit came into being because of the body, it is a wonder of wonders. Indeed, I am amazed at how this great wealth has made its home in this poverty.&quot; 

31 - Jesus said, &quot;No prophet is accepted in his own village; no physician heals those who know him.&quot; 

(32) Jesus said, &quot;A city being built on a high mountain and fortified cannot fall, nor can it be hidden.&quot; 

Jesus said, &quot;When you disrobe without being ashamed and take up your garments and place them under your feet like little children and tread on them, then will you see the son of the living one, and you will not be afraid&quot; 

(39) Jesus said, &quot;The pharisees and the scribes have taken the keys of knowledge (gnosis) and hidden them. They themselves have not entered, nor have they allowed to enter those who wish to. You, however, be as wise as serpents and as innocent as doves.&quot; 

His disciples said to him, &quot;When will the repose of the dead come about, and when will the new world come?&quot; He said to them, &quot;What you look forward to has already come, but you do not recognize it.&quot; 

) Jesus said, &quot;Whoever does not hate his father and his mother cannot become a disciple to me. And whoever does not hate his brothers and sisters and take up his cross in my way will not be worthy of me.&quot; 


Jesus said, &quot;Whoever has come to understand the world has found (only) a corpse, and whoever has found a corpse is superior to the world.&quot; 

(60) a Samaritan carrying a lamb on his way to Judea. He said to his disciples, &quot;That man is round about the lamb.&quot; They said to him, &quot;So that he may kill it and eat it.&quot; He said to them, &quot;While it is alive, he will not eat it, but only when he has killed it and it has become a corpse.&quot; They said to him, &quot;He cannot do so otherwise.&quot; He said to them, &quot;You too, look for a place for yourself within repose, lest you become a corpse and be eaten.&quot; 

Jesus said, &quot;It is to those who are worthy of my mysteries that I tell my mysteries. Do not let your left (hand) know what your right (hand) is doing.&quot; 

(63) Jesus said, &quot;There was a rich man who had much money. He said, 'I shall put my money to use so that I may sow, reap, plant, and fill my storehouse with produce, with the result that I shall lack nothing.' Such were his intentions, but that same night he died. Let him who has ears hear.&quot; 

(64) Jesus said, &quot;A man had received visitors. And when he had prepared the dinner, he sent his servant to invite the guests. He went to the first one and said to him, 'My master invites you.' He said, 'I have claims against some merchants. They are coming to me this evening. I must go and give them my orders. I ask to be excused from the dinner.' He went to another and said to him, 'My master has invited you.' He said to him, 'I have just bought a house and am required for the day. I shall not have any spare time.' He went to another and said to him, 'My master invites you.' He said to him, 'My friend is going to get married, and I am to prepare the banquet. I shall not be able to come. I ask to be excused from the dinner.' He went to another and said to him, 'My master invites you.' He said to him, 'I have just bought a farm, and I am on my way to collect the rent. I shall not be able to come. I ask to be excused.' The servant returned and said to his master, 'Those whom you invited to the dinner have asked to be excused.' The master said to his servant, 'Go outside to the streets and bring back those whom you happen to meet, so that they may dine.' Businessmen and merchants will not enter the places of my father.&quot;

            <Title>Salavan Soreen</Title>
            <Text>The garden holds a sacred place in Solitant cosmology. Every person who wants to appear distinguished builds one. Since Mandri grew up amongst these well-adjusted persons, he’d seen his fair share of gardens. He’d walked under the royal palms of Skinee, and he’d nearly drowned in the terraced falls of Luzee. He’d seen every garden that people brag about seeing, but none of these sights compared to Lord Salavan’s garden. Everyone else’s garden was a thirsty greenscape, accented here and there by vibrant splashes of flower and fruit and split in half by the glow of the atmosphere reflecting off the surface of some placid stream or lake. Salavan’s garden was a garden of stone. Mandri had never heard of a garden composed entirely of curated stone. When he stepped through Salavan’s gate and onto a plane of bone-white pebbles, he gasped.
It was a true garden. It obeyed all the rules a young artist learns when scribbling out compositions for clients. First and foremost is to establish a hierarchy of form—if there are stones they’ve got to come in different sizes—big, medium, and small—and they’re to be arranged in such a way so as to draw the eye, or in this case, a person, through a maze of perception and towards what is important. It was about contrast. Most rules of thumb in art have to do with manipulating contrast. Sharp against soft. Dark against light. Many against few. Big against little. Here, a rippling sea of smooth white pebbles bounced up against jagged knots of gray granite, granite which grew in size towards the center of this snow-white field of stone. In the very center stood a towering spike of Fabled Black.
Fabled Black. The skewering stone. Shard of the firmament. The quintessence of night. If it were a tree, and the pebbles, grass, and the granite were bushes, it all would have been too deliberate—a stilted garden, devoid of the dynamism and spontaneity one sees in Nature. But this was a god-killing stone, and so the stasis, the absence of life, that was the point.
Mandri walked right up to this black obelisk. He saw his own reflection in its surface sheen split by streaks of rain. He looked worse than he’d ever been—eyes red and witless, face gaunt and sallow, lips cracked, and his sodden hair clung too tight to his meatless skull. He looked like death. Perhaps everyone who looked into the depths of Fabled Black looked like death.
He lamented the absence of his burgeon beer.
A man’s voice rose out of the ether behind him.
“The stone makes the most wondrous pigment.”
Mandri spun around, and standing five feet behind him was a massive man who stood two heads taller than Mandri. The man’s barrel of a chest was easily thrice the size of Mandri’s own. His great bulk was draped in a white silk robe, and his face was Jandrian through and through—high cheeks, a strong brow, and narrow eyes. The only outlier was his hair, for he had no beard, and instead of the usual scruff of Jandri black, his hair was as white as his robe, or the rocks underneath his feet.
He didn’t look like a demon, though Mandri couldn’t be sure, for he’d long lost his burgeon beer, and without its aid, his burgeonsight was dimming. Nothing was twisting the man’s genteel airs. He looked so prim and proper because he kept his great bulk out of the rain through the use of a tiny, black-lacquered umbrella.
This large man looked past Mandri towards the obelisk and said, “It makes a black that rivals the crow.”
Mandri dared to sneak a look behind at the spire of Fabled Black. He wanted to ask how this man had come into possession of such a thing, and why he dared to keep it outdoors. A spire of Fabled Black like this must be worth a mountain. But of course, he was a Hrkan Lord. 
“I am Salavan,” the man said. “And you are the great Mandrameen. I love your work. I was hoping that, some day, you would find your way to my door, and here you are.”
Mandri spread his arms out wide to present himself, and he began to bow.
“No need for such gestures,” Salavan said. He then walked up to the spike of Fabled Black and set his meaty hand upon it, caressing it as if it were a prized horse.
“It is incredible isn’t it?” he said. “Yet it is only a small sliver of the comet which killed Solraheen and Schisol.”
Curiosity got the best of Mandri, and he asked, “How did you get it?”
“Bribery,” Salavan said proudly. “Provisions for the smuggling alone cost me thirty-five silver strings.”
“I see.”
Salavan grimaced at Mandri’s critical tone. He said, “I didn’t steal it, boy, I paid for it. I didn’t pay Lord Gagan, but I did pay; what does it matter that the money went to poorer people than it was supposed to? Besides, a stone such as this belongs in a place of prominence, not shuttered away in some dirty Jeketian cave. Here it is out in the air, where it belongs. You can touch it if you like.”
“No thanks.”
“You’re right, there’s no need.” Salavan pulled his hand away from the rock. “Merely being in its presence is enough.”
Fabled Black was notorious for its aura of gloom. A small shard of it could make the happiest child feel rotten. Here in such quantity, that feeling crept down to the bone.
Salavan followed Mandri’s gaze. “Isn’t it strange that everything that falls from the sky should radiate sadness? Rain makes me sad, and so does this stone. Either the heavens are a reservoir of a despair and these elemental things are infused with it, or this world is a supremely disappointing place, and so things cast down upon it radiate a longing to be somewhere else.” He turned to Mandri and his gaze grew intense. “Would you say that’s what you feel right now? A longing to be somewhere else?”
“You could say that.”
“Don’t be so glib. Consider—wouldn’t the rain prefer to dance in the clouds? Wouldn’t this stone rather gird the stars than be stuck here in the ground? I think so. You see, the Black is alive. In a very real sense, it is alive, and I can’t wait to show you what it can do. Would you like to see?”
Salavan spared Mandri a beneficent smile. His teeth were as white as Pel’s, though they did not sparkle—perhaps the stone, or the long march up the hill was pushing the burgeons out of Mandri’s sight and his mind back into sobriety. 
Mandri said, “I don’t have a choice, do I?”
“What gave you that idea?”
“Pel.”
“Ah, of course, Pel. I take it she said that if you didn’t come and see me, she would kill you?”
“Something like that.”
“And here you are, seeing me.”
“Here I am.”
“Then you have fulfilled that obligation, and you can leave if you wish.”
Mandri could actually see Pel waiting outside the gate thanks to the gate’s ankle-high clearance. He could see the white him of her robe stained with splats of blood. It was easy to imagine her listening in, licking her stomach-ripping teeth.
Salavan’s brow to pinched up. “I won’t have this tension in my house,” he said. “You are safe here, and you are free to leave at any time. Or, if you are at all curious about what may lay in store for you, then say it, and we shall find it out together.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
Salavan chuckled and his great bulk chuckled along with him. “Yes, I am aware. Would you like to come inside?”
Mandri nodded, but Salavan scowled back. “Assert yourself,” he said brusquely. “I won’t have any of this meekness in my house. Stand up straight if you can. Sol’s light. You look like you were born yesterday.”
Mandri shuffled his feet, then said, “I’ll go.”
“That’s not much better,” Salavan said as his whole face scrunched up tight. “but it will have to do. Come.” Salavan then skirted around Mandri and past the spike of Fabled Black. He was careful to keep his feet out of any puddles, and his umbrella was so small that he couldn’t walk at stride without the rain splashing his legs—so he shuffled across his stone yard, looking to Mandri like a great white pig tiptoeing its way through nettles. 
Mandri followed, and once he was under the roof of the palace’s grand portico, Salavan gave him a patronizing look of concern.
“You’re soaked,” Salavan said, “A towel and a change of clothes.” He clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed from a servant’s door, carrying a towel and a white linen tunic. Mandri was dried and fitted with this knee-length garb, then he and Salavan proceeded inside.
Salavan said, “It cost me fifty silver strings to import the lumber to burn the lime for the plaster, and that was for the outer wall. This interior, the plaster, the paints, that cost…well, I don’t want to go on and on about expenses.” He gave a smug and self-aware smile.
Mandri merely nodded, but he was not impressed. Unlike the garden outside, the place met expectations. Mandri could have been standing inside any number of palaces that scabbed the Hrkan world; tall arched ceilings, wide halls with skinny walls, sparsely decorated, and everything painted white. Only natural light, Solraheen’s light, was allowed. The day’s rainy gray was unable to illuminate the vast interior, and so it was dark, stark, and empty. That emptiness was a pious expression of sorts, for nothing should compete with Solraheen’s brilliance. In every Hrk work, the ostentation of color was to be abhorred, with the exception of paintings, for these are sacred expressions as well. But every painting must be self-contained, bounded by a frame, for it was said that Solraheen would refuse to dwell in a place that presumed to blur the line between human and divine creation. 
Such a pious quest for emptiness is not at odds with the extravagant games that the rich play to prove their wealth—if one is allowed to have only nothing, the question becomes, how much nothing could one accumulate? The height of Salavan’s ceiling was a measure of how much emptiness he could afford to horde. Judge the floor—the richer man’s floor bears nothing, not even dirt. A truly rich man could afford to employ a person or persons to always be wiping away the filth tramped in from the street. Salavan’s floor was as white as the sway-away ceiling, and as he and Mandri walked along barefoot, a girl crawled behind on hands and knees with a bowl of water and a brush, scrubbing away.
Salavan asked, “How do you find my home?”
“Very clean,” said Mandri, careful to disguise his bitterness.
“Yes. Perhaps you will find my gallery stimulating. I’ve some pieces here that you won’t see anywhere else—but that goes without saying.”
“Any of them stolen?”
The accusation put a slight hitch in Salavan’s step. But the Lord wasn’t upset, in fact, he smiled, like being accused of stealing was a compliment. 
“None of them are stolen. One does not become voted a Lord by making enemies. Aside from that shard of Fabled Black, I’ve acquired everything I own through perfectly legal means. I even have something of yours here. One of your best works, I think.”
“Spare me.”
“Don’t be modest, Mandri. I won’t have this falseness.”
Salavan clapped his hands and another servant came forth from some narrow orifice, carrying a shallow bowl lined with finger-length wraps of freeweed.
Salavan said, “If paintings aren’t your pleasure, how about a wrap?”
Mandri declined, and Salavan seemed genuinely surprised. “You are remarkably lucid,” he said. “You do have that hopeless look about you, but I supposed that was, you know, the general malaise of the indigent.”
Salavan selected a wrap for himself, put it in a pocket inside his robe, and waved the servant away. 
He said, “We shall skip the freeweed, and perhaps we’ll skip the gallery tour for another time, you came here for a purpose, after all.”
“About that,” Mandri said. “I can tell you right now that I’m not a—”
Salavan stopped him mid-sentence with a polite wave of his hand. “You cannot tell me anything,” he said. “I should say that I know more about you than you know about yourself.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“A thing to know about me, Mandri—I am straightforward, and I do not lie because lying wastes time.”
“What’s my mother’s name?”
Salavan scoffed, then dismissed Mandri’s question by stating, “I don’t pollute my mind with such trifles. And neither do you. Do you know know the personal name of a lizard? No. Do you know more about a lizard than it knows about itself? Yes. Your knowledge of the lizard circumscribes the minutiae of its life to draw a more complete picture. That is simply how our minds work; we must blur the details if we want to know a thing. Do you get my meaning?” 
Mandri kept his mouth shut. He nodded politely, because one does not reveal their true thoughts to a Hrkan Lord, and Salavan was a true Hrkan Lord—self-serious, proud, and had a knack for making the most mundane observations sound insulting.
“I can see that you are going to need it explained, “ he said. “Come. We must study at least one piece of art. Come.”
Salavan led Mandri through a series of rooms, each with a ceiling higher than the one before. Common to the fashion of the Hrkan elite, what few furnishings there were, were muted. If there was a table, it was carved from a rough, pale sandstone. If there was a chair, its legs were simple, sanded branches, and its seat was woven reed. If there was a tapestry, it was devoid of color and image, for its purpose was to be a frame for the faded subtleties of Solraheen’s light, which at present was cold and dark, blueish-gray.
Salavan led Mandri into a cavernous room that had a circular cutout in its roof. A light rain suffused with silver sunlight streamed down through this hole to pitter-patter in a circular rainwater pool. All edges of the room were laden with pillows, all of them white with white tassels and stuffed inside ivory cotton pillowcases.
On the other side of the column of rain was fresco that spanned the entirety of the wall. This painting was the object of Salavan’s march, and it was a magnificent work of art in skill and in subject. It depicted Solraheen at the very moment of His victory over evil—He was stretched out, as if flying, and his face wore a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his sword as He plunged it into His brother’s—Schisol’s—back. In the classic Hrkan style, Solraheen was pure white, and Schisol was an ashy black. The army of people surrounding them were cast in every color imaginable.
“This is my favorite piece.” Salavan said contentedly. “For sentimental reasons, mostly. The god of creation destroying the god of destruction. Shouldn’t it be the other way around? It has so much behind it, if you know what I mean.”
“I don’t.”
Salavan didn’t hear Mandri’s murmur.
“See this yellow?” he said. “Isn’t it beautiful?”
He was pointing to the golden rays which emanated out from Solraheen’s head. It truly was a fantastic yellow, extraordinarily vibrant, as if it had been painted on mere moments ago.
“Can you guess the pigment?”
Mandri answered, “I have no idea.”
“This yellow, it comes from the Gabo cow. Incredibly expensive. The most wasteful pigment imaginable. To make enough for this fresco I had to buy three men to care for fifty cows. I had to put them on a strict diet, the cows. They couldn’t eat anything but this little squeaking bug, called a zuberant. They look like locusts, but they are the thickness of your thumb, well, my thumb.”
“I’ve seen them.”
“You can buy the zuberants in bulk. Then you make a paste out of them, and feed it to the cows. The cows bellies have to be stuffed full all at once. That means you have to starve them a bit so they take to that bug-paste like dogs to the bone. The next step had to be timed just right, because you see, this radiant pigment comes from the chyme of the cow’s third stomach, so you must be precise with the cutting. You must wait until the chyme extrudes into that stomach, not the first or second stomach, the third stomach, and that’s when you cut open the beast and harvest as much of this yellow chyme as you can. Then, you dry it out into a powder, and that is that.”
“Interesting.”
“Once you have the powder, you can sell the meat. But I don’t sell the meat. I let it rot in the sun.”
“Why?”
“Because it feels…” Salavan waved his hand in the air as if to catch the words that could accurately describe what he was thinking. “It feels weighty to have killed a herd of beasts for the explicit purpose of painting my wall. Doesn’t Solraheen look radiant? And now that you know fifty cows died to make it seem so, doesn’t that make the fresco take on a more…oh, I can’t find the words. It’s weighty. Makes it feel more purposeful.”
“It doesn’t do anything for me.”
Salavan’s round face lit up. “Hah! It doesn’t, does it?! Well you can’t judge me boy, no one can. The gods are all dead. And here are the last of them, Schisol and Solraheen, and there—” he pointed to the top of the piece, to the screaming black comet in the sky, “There is the Fabled Black coming to end them both. Such a fine image, no? The quality of the painting is sublime, yes?”
“Sure.”
“Don’t be flippant. It is beautiful. This is Ellag’s hand. I trust you are familiar with her work?”
“I am.”
“She is here, you know. I keep her here to help me find my Mazid. That is why you are here. Tell me, Mandri, do you know what a Mazid is?”
“Of course. Everybody knows.”
“What does everybody know?”
Mandri thought for a moment. Salavan’s request for clarification suggested the man was seeking some deeper truth about a Mazid’s nature than mere appearance, but appearance was all Mandri knew. He had seen Mazidai from a distance, as they were never far from their Hrkan Lords. They all had a certain slightness of size, and all of them were shrouded in dark robes, never spoke, and were followed around by coterie of minders.
Mandri had only ever seen one of them up close. It was a young woman, underfed, and her serene expression was couched in generic Hrkan features—thin lips and sad eyes, all in symmetrical, near-genderless proportion.
But what was she?
The only thing everyone really knows about the Mazidai is that they can shoot a scorching beam of golden fire out of their mouths. This fire, Mazidfire, can destroy anything. Beyond that, Mandri knew nothing. He’d been told stories about the origin of the Mazidai as a child, but couldn’t remember them. It all had something to do with Solraheen. He never paid close attention because it wasn’t something he ever wanted to be a part of.
He finally said, “Everybody knows that a Mazid is a weapon.”
Salavan seemed to expect this response. “That is one function a Mazid fulfills,” he said, “But it is better to think of the Mazidai as tools which Solraheen grants us Lords to help us organize the world.”
“Right,” said Mandri, remembering. “A Mazid is endowed with the power to destroy evil.”
Salavan chuckled, as if Mandri had just said something precious and absurd. He said, “Tell me, Mandri, how can something which does not exist be destroyed?”
“You’re saying that evil doesn’t exist?”
“Of course it doesn’t. Consider—can you point to evil? I can point to you, I can point to this wall, but I cannot point to evil.”
Mandri said, “If Pel were here, I’d point to her. She ripped out Gil’s stomach.”
“Who is Gil?”
“My ox.”
“What is evil about that? Have you never chewed on a slab of tripe?”
“She didn’t eat the stomach. She ate Gil’s Spark.”
Salavan’s white eyebrows jumped and he reflexively muttered, “Interesting…but I doubt you saw the beast’s Spark.”
“I saw what I saw.”
“Please, Mandri, you’re too intelligent to lean on tautology. You know that there is a difference between seeing and understanding, and I suspect you know that there is a difference between the sensation of understanding and actual understanding.”
“I saw what I saw.”
“But how do you know you’re not lying to yourself? You’ve told yourself a story and you believe it. You believe it as easily as you believe the stories about how the world came to be, but none of these stories are true.” He pointed to the fresco of Solraheen and Shisol. “This story here is a lie. It claims that Solraheen called forth a stone of Fabled Black from the night to end Himself and His brother—it is a simple and neat story, but it is not the truth.”
Salavan put his fat finger up on the fresco and poked Schisol’s belly, right where Solraheen’s sword burst forth. A click sounded from under the floor, and a square of stone levered open to reveal a narrow stairway descending into darkness. 
“Before we head down,” said Salavan, “I must demand from you your utmost commitment. I, unlike the Solitants, value honesty, so my good character compels me to warn you that there is a chance—a chance—that as we attempt to squeeze your Spark for ripeness, you will die. It is only a chance, and a small one at that, but I want you to consider the thought before you join me.”
Salavan hiked up the hem of his robe, and disappeared down into the stairs.
Mandri stared down into that inky blackness. Not a thought went through his head. He must have stared for quite a while, because Salavan’s voice echoed up, saying, “I said consider the thought, not inhabit it!”
Mandri stepped down the stairs and a servant girl bustled out from some hidden passage and closed the hatch behind him.
At the bottom of the stairs was a narrow hall, and at the end of this hall was a cramped room with a low ceiling. In the room’s far right corner was a smoldering fire in a bronze brazier, and set up in the middle of the room were three wooden chairs, with two chairs facing one. Salavan sat in one of the two, and in the other was a person draped in a white sheet.
“Don’t look so pale,” Salavan sighed. “I told you not to come down if you weren’t committed. You’ve come, and now you’re here, yes?”
Mandri nodded.
“Good. Sit down.” 
Mandri took the remaining seat, across from Salavan and the veiled stranger. Salavan pulled the wrap of freeweed from his pocket, and he lit it in the brazier’s wispy flames. He puffed it thrice to get it going.
“So!” he said as he slapped his leg to capture Mandri’s attention. “Are you the gaburshegee? infertile ground? The castrated painter? Or is it simply, the painter who doesn’t want to be a painter? You’d be surprised how many of those we find.”
Salavan puffed on his wrap.
Mandri simply sat there.
“Are your wits here, Mandri? Are you here?”
Mandri nodded.
“Use your voice. Assert yourself.”
Mandri cleared his throat, then nodded towards the sheeted person and asked, “Who is that?”
“This is Ellag. Or I should say, it was Ellag. She is dead. As I mentioned earlier, I keep her here to help my search for a Mazid. You see, I am looking for someone who understands what it means to be inspired. I find that Ellag’s presence helps to demonstrate the truth of the matter.”
Salavan’s chair creaked as he laid back into it. He blew a puff of smoke out the side of his mouth, as if the smoke could go anywhere in this cramped room. Between the freeweed and the fire, Mandri was having a hard time finding a clean breath. Then Salavan crossed his tree-trunk legs and said, “Tell me, Mandri, what do you think Art is? If you could define it. Define Art.”
Mandri reflexively answered, “Art is whatever you want it to be.”
“Don’t be coy, Mandri. This is important. You must be eased into the right frame of mind before we move on to the test itself.”
“I just don’t think the question of Art’s nature is an interesting one. I’m more concerned about what’s under that sheet.”
“Is that why you don’t want to paint anymore, you think it is uninteresting?”
“More or less.”
“Which is it, more, or less? Be specific. You’ve spent too much time in front of an easel not to have some idea of what it is that you are doing.”
“I make pretty pictures.”
Salavan rolled his eyes and took a long drag from his wrap. He held the smoke in his great big chest, and when he finally exhaled, his round shoulders slumped like the essence of life was leaving him.
“You think Art is merely a word,” he said. “You think that it’s a label that people slap onto things for utility.”
“I didn’t say that.”
“Then say something. I’m trying to help you avoid ending up like Ellag here.”
Salavan puts his arm around Ellag’s shoulder and gave her body a friendly shake. Her sheeted head rolled limply and then settled into the crook of Salavan’s shoulder as if she were looking to cuddle. As she did, the sheet pulled taught over her face and a smears of blood welled up to stain the fibers.
Salavan narrowed his eyes and glared at Mandrameen. The air between them swirled with smoke. 
“Answer my question,” Salavan commanded.
“Is she dead?” Mandri squeaked.
“Of course she’s dead. Answer the question.”
“What was the question?” 
Salavan sighed again, then he steadied Ellag back onto her own chair so that he could lean forward and free his hands for explanation. He said, “Ellag thought that art was about the artist. A person goes out into the world and has some incredible experience—like you’re having now. It changes them in some important, fundamental way. They are a different person because of it. They look at the world differently. But how could any of their friends or family know that any of this has occurred? The change is internal, it is not written on the skin. There’s no new sparkle in the eye. Their behavior might be different, but that will never communicate the depth of what is going on inside the mind. Consider a woman crying—for what reason does she cry? She tells you her child has died, but you’ve never had a child, Mandri, so how could you understand? This is the problem which Art purports to solve. A work of art is an attempt to break through that impenetrable barrier between our minds.”
Not one word of that made it to Mandri’s ear. He was too focused on finding a chance to flee. Salavan was so wrapped up in his speech, and in the freeweed’s smoke, that Mandri wondered if he could make a dash for the stairs.
Salavan said, “That’s what Ellag thought. She thought that art is a thing an artist does to let everyone else know what’s going on inside. Does that make sense?”
“It’s very sentimental.”
“Isn’t it? Sentimental, yes, that would be a word for it. Unfortunately, it is completely and utterly wrong. Look how wrong it can be.”
Salavan bent down, grabbed the foot of Ellag’s sheet, and in one quick flourish, he flipped it over the back of her chair to reveal her corpse.
Her dead head bobbed and settled, and as it did a trickle of blood dripped out of the empty sockets that had once held her eyes. The belly of her tunic had been ripped apart, while the belly itself had been carved open with surgical care—skin folded back like a book to reveal a cavity under her ribs. The firelight flickered inside. Mandri could see her spine. She was hollowed out. 
“Steady, Mandri. Steady yourself…now, looking at Ellag, you might suppose that I think I am an artist, and that this,” he put his hand on Ellag’s skull and twisted it about in a perverse display of puppetry. “This is me communicating to you in a way that lets you experience, in a profound way, who I am and what it’s like to be me.”
He let go of Ellag’s head, and it slumped down onto her collarbone.
“But that would be a misunderstanding. Consider this—why isn’t speech, casual, conversational speech like we’re having now, why isn’t that considered to be Art? I am manipulating my throat, tongue, teeth, and lips to shape a string of sounds for you to experience. Sentences are things that can break down that barrier between our minds, yes?”
At this point the freeweed was having its way with Salavan. His arm’s gesticulations were growing frenetic. He cut the air with a slicing hand and said, “No. I am not an artist. I am many things, but I am not an artist.”
“You’re a murderer.”
“I’m not a murderer, either.”
Salavan took another big drag from his freeweed. The room was so small, and the smoke was so thick, that Mandri supposed it was getting to him too.
“Actually,” Salavan said, “that’s not true, I am a murderer. But I think you’re referring to Ellag, here. I did not kill Ellag. She died because she thought painting was about the artist. She thought that the painter was important. She thought far too much of herself.” He was now churning his words in the air with his free hand, as if mixing his musings with the smoke would bring out some flavor of the truth.
“You’re insane,” said Mandri.
“It is good that you should say that. Ellag was never able to make that step. She was too…she was too wrapped up in herself. Frightened.” He leaned forward a little in his seat. “See, if you look into the black when you’re frightened, you’re bound to see frightening things.” 
Salavan made an explosion with his fingers, pretending to burst his eyes.
“Her eyes exploded?” Mandri asked.
“They did. It was fascinating.”
“What about her stomach?”
“Oh. That was me. Pel wanted to query the girl’s stomach. All done after the fact, I assure you. But we shouldn’t get distracted. I think you are about where you need to be.” He poked these words with his wrap of freeweed, and this shook a clump of ash free from the glowing tip, causing Salavan to eye his wrap with some concern. He stood up, set it gently down onto the corner of his seat, and moseyed over to the far left corner of the room, hidden by Ellag’s shadow. There he struggled with a huge square stone slab which was as black as the darkness from which he pulled it. He propped it up against his thighs and waddled it over. He laid it down flat at Mandri’s feet, and then he shuffled back into the dark to fetch three three clay jars. He set these jars next to the black stone panel. In each jar was black paint.
Salavan pulled from his robe a paintbrush. Its handle was short compared to the length of the brush’s head, which was as long as Mandri’s forearm. It looked more like a miniature whip than a paintbrush. Salavan handed it to Mandri and said, “I want you to use this brush and these paints to paint a picture.”
“A picture of what?”
“Don’t think about what you are painting. Don’t give yourself that privilege. Don’t think about what should or shouldn’t be. You need to simply start painting.”
“You want me to figure things out as I go?”
“No, no. Don’t figure anything out. You are merely a tool. True art creates itself. It is reckoned with on its own terms. It is its own experience. It communicates nothing but what it is. You kneel here—” Salavan rubbed the floor in front of Mandri with his foot. “And you become the tool by which the work creates itself.”
Mandri squinted in confusion. None of that made a lick of sense. If he thought about nothing, then he would paint nothing. Even if he wanted to paint something, it would be hopeless, because in this dim light he wouldn’t be able to see what he was doing. And there were only the three black paints to put on a black slab of rock.
Salavan sat back down, and the sheer weight of him plopping onto his too-small chair disturbed Ellag’s corpse and she slumped forward over her knees. Her limp wrists smacked onto the floor.
“This test,” Salavan said thoughtfully, “Is a test to determine how skilled you are at removing yourself from yourself. You see, artists make the best divine instruments because of how practiced they are at suppressing themselves. Every time you paint you must look at the painting as if you weren’t involved, as if you are completely oblivious to all the meaning you’ve nestled inside every brushstroke. You must do this because you wish to know how the painting will move on someone who is not you.” 
Mandri nodded as if Salavan was making sense. He then decided he better get it over with. Perhaps if he swirled some of the paint on the rock, then Salavan would let him leave. He knelt down before the black stone surface and thought about what he should do.
With no palette, the stone itself would have to be the palette. It wasn’t like he was going to run into trouble mixing paints if the only color was black. One by one one, he picked up the clay jars and, trembling, he poured their contents onto the stone surface. The only difference between these paints, it seemed, was their viscosity. The first paint came out of its jar in a clump. It slopped onto the stone like a sandy gel. Mandri could see little granules of Fabled Black sparkling in the firelight. The next paint was a clean, syrupy goo that drizzled out of the jar. The last paint was so thin that he had to be careful pouring it out, lest it splash all over the place. Thankfully, the surface of the stone was ever so slightly bowled.
When Mandri was done with all this, he cast a side-eyed glance at Salavan to see if the man approved of what he was doing.
Salavan glared back and said, “Don’t look at me, look at the work.”
Mandri’s breathing grew nervy, and the smoke in the air was stifling. He fanned his tunic—light as the linen was, the room's heat had become unbearable. He knew that Salavan was looking for him to do a specific something, and if he didn’t do it, he would not be allowed to leave.
“What will happen if I fail?” he asked.
Salavan shook his head and said, “Think, instead, of what will happen if you should succeed. If you can work, and let yourself be used by the work, then I am going to stick you onto a wagon, full of artists like yourself, and it shall cross the Sand and lead you to the Amalgamete. You shall meet Him in the flesh! Think of it—meeting a god! He will make you into a champion!”
“But what should I paint?”
This, Salavan did not answer. He took another drag of his freeweed and reclined back into his chair. He looked away, studied his own smoke, as if he was alone in the room.
Mandri turned his attention back to the slathered-black stone. 
What could he possibly paint with black, on top of black, on top of black?
He poked the long-haired brush into the sandy gel and spread it around. It did not mix with the other paints, it pushed right through them, and the thinner paints in turn flooded into the grooves left by the brush’s passing.
He sat back on his heels and studied the whorl he’d made. The sheen of the orange firelight played with each paint differently. It stuck softly to the fine grained gel, it stippled the syrupy fluid, and it hardly touched the thinnest paint. Wherever the thinnest paint pooled, the image was truly black.
Mandri began to push and pull the paints around to build an image out of the light, as a sculptor might build an image out of shadows. He didn’t much care about what he was making, the brush hairs were too long and too limp to be too deliberate.
What was he making?
Black pools welled up like the hollows of human eyes.
A face, why not?
A stripe of shadow for the upper lip.
Mound up the gel to bring out the cheeks.
It was coming along.
A long and powerful face.
Mandri swirled the brush around in an eye socket, trying to find an eye.
Suddenly, there it was, an eye of firelight.
It blinked.
Mandri startled backwards in fright. He quickly gathered his wits and peered disbelievingly down at that fire-flickering eye.
The thinnest stream of black ran down below the upper lip, opening the mouth, drawing Mandri’s eye.
Was there a tongue in there? A black snake of a tongue glinting in the back of the throat?
Yes. There it was.
“Do you see this?” Mandri asked, but no response came.
He looked up to see what Salavan was doing, but Salavan was not there. Neither was the dead woman. Neither were the chairs, or the walls, or the room—there was only Mandri, the fire, the face, and the void.
Suddenly, the face began to extrude out of the stone, dripping in Fabled Black. Mandri scrambled backwards on all fours. When the black head was fully in the round it tilted down to stare at Mandri. Its eyes were a rainbow fire and its gaze consumed him. Mandri could feel his Spark tug against his stomach, as if it were being pulled. He screamed, but no sound came. A pressure grasped at his throat, a pair of strangling hands, and this force jerked him backwards, and backwards again, and suddenly, he was yanked out of the void.
When Mandri opened his eyes again, he was stunned to see that he was back in Salavan’s basement. It was Salavan’s hands on his throat, and it was Salavan’s face hovering over his own.
“What did you see?” Salavan asked as he shook Mandri.
Mandri’s brow was pouring with sweat. 
“I saw—I saw a face.”
Salavan studied the painted slab, then muttered a single, breathless word, “Incredible...”
Mandri tried to pull himself free from Salavan’s grip, but the man did not let go. Instead, Salavan roared and threw his great weight down upon Mandri and pinned him against the ground. Mandri heaved and wiggled but it was all for naught, for Salavan was strong.
“Hold still! You…must…hold…still!”
Salavan jabbed his elbow into Mandri’s stomach and leaned his great weight into it, squeezing the air from Mandri’s lungs. Tears streamed down Mandri’s face and his chest burned in agony. Salavan’s meaty hands clamped tight on Mandri’s throat and he squeezed with all his might.
Salavan’s plumping smile savored every desperate wheeze.
“I knew your Spark was ripe the moment I saw you,” he muttered.
A few juddering moments later, Mandrameen’s body was dead.</Text>
            <Notes>

“You mean the Mazydai?”
“I mean abominations. Think of it, Mandri, if it weren’t for the power of the Mazydai which has been pulled from the flesh of Solraheen, the Hrks would never have conquered the outland tribes.

            <Title>Amalgamete</Title>
            <Text>There’s nothing complicated about terror. Mandri was all too familiar with its tired routine—first it startled him into stupidity, and then it spurred him into action, or petrified him, according to the flavor of the moment. There was no fighting it. When Mandri saw that hag-beetle, he became terrified, and that terror only gained on him as he fled through the temple’s dark bowels.
He bumped his nose and toes on stone shelves and cabinet footings because he wasn’t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn’t allowed, according to Moto, because there wasn’t any time, even though Moto took time to light one up for himself. Mandi thought Moto was being unreasonable, but that’s how it goes with terror, it pushes reason aside. Mandri himself was unreasonable, because there truly wasn’t any time. He could hear a clicking somewhere in the dark behind him.
He hated these Ayramun for leading him here, but he also loved these Ayramun for protecting him from the dark. He wanted to flee from them, and he wanted to stay as close as he could. Moto led them into a dark dead end, and Mandri hated him. Moto led them into a windowed hall flush with fresh night air, and Mandri loved him. Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated her. Mandri slipped on a spot of Seb’s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated her—Seb was the sole exception to this confusing succession of emotional states which blurred together. He despised Seb entirely, but the others he loved and hated, or was it hated and loved. The fact that it was possible to love and hate a person suggested that these emotions were only crude approximations of a deeper reality which he could not articulate. It was as if there was a color portrait to be painted here but all Mandri had were pigments of black and white.
Then there were the beetles, haunting the dark halls behind. His fear of them mixed in with all of this. It reminded him, and this was not the time for it, but it reminded him of Solraheen, for His love was both comforting and terrifying. Yes, Mandri feared a loving Divine.
He hated Elrahet for her witchy mumblings as she scampered along in the dark, her torch bobbing right and left.
“This isn’t right,” she hissed through clenched teeth. “Isn’t right, isn’t right, isn’t right.”
Then he loved her when she took the lead and shouted, “This way!” like she knew where she was going.
Moteah had been right behind Mandri this whole time, and she yanked on Mandri’s arm.
“Put your sword away, you idiot!”
Mandri didn’t even know he had it out.
“You’re going to stab me,” she said.
“I won’t.”
“You’re going to stab somebody if you don’t put it away. Damn it Moto, why did you give him a sword?”
Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade, and good thing he did, because Elrahet suddenly took a sharp turn into another dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. 
“What are we doing?” Moteah asked with venom, begging to lead.
By this point Moto had lost his poise. “I say we wait here for Ayram! And if I say it, that’s what we’ll do!”
Moteah sneered and said, “You want to wait here for the beetles to find us?”
“Better to fight here than in the hall!”
Seb sucked in a hiss between her teeth. “So we jus’ bumblin’ around?”
They all looked to Elrahet.
“My foot is sore,” Elrahet said. “I need off it.”
Moto groaned and smacked the wall in frustration. “This is why I should be in charge. Ayram put me in charge. Now, I say we need to stop and think, because stumbling through the dark isn’t doing any good.”
“And how would you know?” Moteah asked.
“There’s got to be another exit.”
Mandri retreated into a dark corner of the room as the others got into an argument about how thinking about finding an exit could possibly help them find it.
Mandri wished this temple wasn’t so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. It wasn’t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps because there weren’t any fittings for them bolted onto the walls. Whoever built this place wanted it to be dark. This room had no hope of natural light—Shulgi was much too thick in the belly for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help the unrighteous lose themselves, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.
At least there was something to look at. Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around the blocky walls of this apparent dead end, and these rows were stacked upon each other from floor to ceiling. All the walls were carved up like this, and most were painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with lines of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears. There were garden scenes where Old Jandri kings strolled along in quiet contemplation. There were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of Solraheen’s dark brother, Schisol, burning martyrs who screamed as tongues of flame licked their skin.
Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that the images told. It reminded him of Hrkan tomb art—a rich man decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when he dies and the tomb’s door is sealed, no one is allowed to have a look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and then no one is looking. A monumental waste of good pigment.
No places for candles in a tomb.
No room for natural light either.
Maybe this place was to be a tomb.
Unfortunately, Mandri wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at in terms of narrative. He wasn’t even sure if he were reading the panels in the right direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether?
He looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight. It was hard to see, because not only was the light too dim, but it blinked every time Moto waved his frantic arms to try and express his argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene—the moment of Solraheen’s birth, when He emerged out of the Void. It was represented here by a blank face floating above a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark ripping out the stone. Each gash was as wide as two of Mandri’s own fingers.
“Uh, guys.”
The others were too engrossed in their squabble to hear him. Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.
Mandri raised his voice, “Hey!”
They all stopped bickering and stared.
“Look at this.”
Mandri pointed at the beastly gash in Solraheen’s forehead. Seb stepped over and studied the defacement with a critical eye. “It’s just scratches.”
“Let me see,” Elrahet grumbled as she waved Mandri and Seb aside with her torch. She stood on her tiptoes and stretched her leathery neck to sniff it. When she balanced back down on her heels, her wrinkled face was gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.
“It is as I feared,” she said bitterly, and she eyed those gathered with contempt, as if all this was somehow their fault. “No more mewling,” she growled, and she pushed past Moto, then trotted off into the darkness of the hallway, black robes fluttering, expecting everyone to follow. 
“Where are we going?” Moto roared as he took off after her.
“To find a way out!”
Moteah and Seb quickly followed, leaving Mandri alone with Obo strapped to his back.
Mandri fished around in his robe’s pocket for his burgeon. He wasn’t about to go running through a demon-infested temple without some way to see those damned beetles before they jumped. The God’s Eye sight would surely reveal their Sparks and whatever lines of purpose guided them, so he pulled his burgeon out, unstopped its tiny thorn-plug, and shook a drop of juice onto his outstretched tongue.
His journey through the dark temple halls began anew. Elrahet led the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the scratches in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was a choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because where else would a desert exit be but at the bottom of the mountain? They ventured so far down into this temple that it seemed to Mandri the building was upside down. A temple’s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens. There should be an ascension to the roof where the penitent could await the coming dawn. But he went down, and the further down he went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. 
Elrahet led them all down a wide fan of stairs. The ceiling and walls bowed out into a black void. They stumbled into a monumental underground expanse, a throne room fit for a god. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts were closing in. It was a sea of darkness, and the Ayramun’s spot of torchlight was a dinghy set adrift in it. Mandri huddled close to the others, and if hadn’t felt the hard stone under his feet, he might have lost his wits completely.
That stone had a fractal pattern etched into it—hairs of black squares lining larger squares. As he walked, this pattern gave way to a procession of obsidian-studded squares straddled on either side by enormous stone columns shaped as legs, legs whose bodies disappeared into the interminable blackness above.
Elrahet picked up speed and purpose. She led them past these columns while Mandri prayed for the God’s Eye sight to come to him, that he might see whatever demons must be hiding in the shadows above.
At pace, they reached the end of the hall unmolested, and uplifted there, on a narrow set of stairs, was a red sandstone throne. This throne’s seat and arms were smooth and featureless, fashioned from river-bloated stone, while its back was a billowing slab carved to look like flame licked into a curl by an unseen wind. Etched into the wall behind was a ring of faces, faces inside of faces—howling animals, untamed men and women, as well as snarling demons.
The throne’s seat was as empty, which is to say it was filled with dark, malevolent purpose. Mandri felt outnumbered against the great emptiness around him.
That’s when he noticed that Seb was missing. And the moment he noticed it, Moteah noticed it too.
The whites of her eyes bulged as she counted and counted again—only four were present. Only four. She counted again as if it were possible to mess up one, two, three, four.
“Where’s…where—”
The question choked her throat as she peered into the darkness behind, hoping to catch sight of Seb, but no one was there. Nor were there footsteps. Seb was gone.
Moto spun around, and upon seeing their number diminished by one, he charged back into the darkness from whence they’d come. He hadn’t gotten far when he stopped and waved his torch.
“Seb!” he shouted.
A silence, followed by Elrahet grumbling, “You’ll wake Schisol Himself from the dead.”
Moto spun around. Suspicion skewed his brow. He marched up to Mandri and grabbed Mandris’ robe. “Where is she?”
“I have no idea,” Mandri replied.
“Let me see your sword.”
“What?”
“Let me see it!”
Mandri fumbled at his sword’s hilt. As he pulled it out he dropped it. It clanged on the stone floor, and in this cavernous hall the noise was magnified to a peal of thunder.
Moto clenched his jaw tight and his eyes accused Mandri of dropping the sword on purpose. Then he lowered his torch to the blade and studied the sheen of light playing upon it. He was looking for signs of use.
“Wait,” said Mandri, confused. “You think I stabbed Seb in the dark?”
“How else did she disappear?”
“It’s not like we’re in a demon infested temple.”
“You were running right behind her!”
“So?”
Moto swung the torch back up and nearly smacked Mandri in the face with it. “Did a demon drop on top of her and carry her away without you seeing? ”
“No—I mean, I don’t know. Maybe.”
Just then, a blood curdling scream echoed through the hall. The sound came from behind the throne, through a perfectly square doorway cut into the wall near the throne’s stairs.
Elrahet took off running towards it. Moto and Moteah followed. Mandri picked up his sword, and though he wanted no part of chasing that scream, the Ayramun were taking their torches with them. He followed everyone else through that square doorway and found another large hall whose length disappeared into darkness. Thankfully, the tall ceiling and walls were brushed with light. There were no demons crawling on them.
Elrahet had only taken twenty steps inside when she stopped cold.
She hunched over her cane and peered into the emptiness ahead. Mandri couldn’t see anything. Then came a faint squelching sound that brought to mind Seb’s borcandi chewing.
“Seb!” Moto shouted. His holler drew an angry side-long glance from Elrahet, and if that wasn’t enough to shut him up, a voice rose out of the dark.
It was a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed the temple itself was speaking.
“Welcome, witch.”
Mandri desperately wanted to flee but somehow couldn’t. He watched on in astonishment as Moto reached back then threw his torch straight down the hall, towards the voice.
The flaming stick went spinning through the air for a good forty yards before it clattered onto the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop at the distant wall, a wall composed of some peculiar material that looked a bit like rough-hewn stone.
“They wish to see my glory,” said the voice. “Let them see.”
Two enormous braziers on either wall erupted into flames, illuminating what Moto’s torch could not, for the distant wall was not a stone wall, it was a colossal mound of flaking skin warted over with bleeding pustules and tags of fat. This swell of flesh was so large that it plugged the room. The whole horrible thing shook as the rasping voice sounded out again, “Behold, my glory!”
The mound of flesh rolled forward, and sticking out of its top, like a cork in a wine bag, was the upper body of a skinny old man, white-bearded, shawled in a shimmering green robe. On his head was a crown, and his arms clutched a woman’s headless body. It was Seb.
This putrid king smiled in the fire’s upshot light, and this smile grew and grew until his jaw dislocated off his skull like a snake’s. He shoved Seb’s lolling neck into his gaping maw, and after he stretched his cheeks beyond reason to accommodate her shoulders, he crunched down onto her spine and began to chew.
A scream of terror died stillborn in Mandri’s throat, for arrayed around this bloated beast’s belly were hag-beetles, at least ten of them. Their ruffled black shells glinted in the light of the braziers, and their fishy, lidless eyes shimmered as they studied Mandri and the Ayramun. Mandri briefly wondered if their many legs should be considered arms because of how they ended in human hands instead of feet.
Mandri turned to flee, but was stopped by the sight of four demon beetles stuck to the wall above the exit. They clicked their legs against their shells like off-the-wagon addicts.
“We’re doomed,” Mandri muttered.
 Moto and Moteah stood in shock, eyes flitting between the great beast and another group of hag-beetles crawling on the ceiling. Only Elrahet showed no fear. She took a step towards Salavan and the beast and bowed deeply, as if petitioning an ordinary outland court. “Greetings, my most repugnant king,” she said in mocking reverence.
The whole mass of the beast then shivered, for up above, the king’s distended ribcage squeezed Seb’s body down into his bloated stomach. The sight of his black tongue licking down Seb’s toes was almost more than Mandri could bear, and this was followed by the crack of his jaw snapping back into place.
Elrahet watched all this with a scornful glare. “You have perverted your flesh, Greskal.” She heaped ridicule upon the name. But the putrid king, this false god, only laughed. His laugh sent a shudder through his whole bloated body, ending in a horrible burp.
“Ech! Keep your names to yourself! Poison yourselves with names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. I am more than any name can bear. Look at me!”
He leaned his whole bulk forward to resettle his great stomach. Mandri suspected that somewhere under the calloused flabs of skin on the floor were legs, but he doubted this demon king could do much more than lean.
“I am no longer Greskal!” he thundered. “I have become…I have become, becoming itself! Name me, witch—I am Amalgamete!”
The echo of his voice filled the hall and stunned all gathered into silence, all save the hag-beetles, who chattered and clicked their chitinous mouths, vibrating with their master’s mood.
“Do you think me ugly?”
Elrahet snarled and spat at the beast.
The Amalgamete laughed again at her casual disrespect. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from tar, living tar, for in the dim light it seemed to be wriggling like a piglet. He pulled it further and let it slip, and the flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.
“This ugliness is the world,” the Amalgamete decreed as he caressed the welling redness. “Don’t you see? This pain of flesh is the pain of the world into which a Spark is thrown. The brighter the light of the Spark, the more this ugliness gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would bow before me as your God!”
Elrahet looked down her nose at this king of demons. “Your son had a stronger stomach than you,” she growled. “Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.”
A paroxysmal twitch shuddered the Amalgamete’s bulk. He pointed to Elrahet and bellowed, “Silence that Spark ensnaring womb!”
A hag beetle dropped from the ceiling.
It fell with tremendous speed, and as it did, its shell split open, revealing a black, insectoid spike which shot out and jabbed at Elrahet, but the old witch deftly stepped aside and dodged it.
The beetle crashed into the floor, and Moto’s sword lashed out and severed the spike from the beetle’s body.
The Amalgamete belched in annoyance as his wounded child scurried away. Then he issued a royal plea to all but Elrahet. “Offer yourselves willingly. Be joined together inside my stomach and know union for once in your miserable lives. And please do not struggle. Stressed meat tastes foul.”
With the natural grace of a man made king from birth, the Amalgamete twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, then waved his minions onward.
Both Moto and Moteah threw down their packs and shielded Elrahet behind them. Mandri held out his sword and assumed responsibility for watching their backs. He turned once more towards the exit. He suddenly regretted not paying more attention to Moto’s fighting lessons, though they might not have helped to prepare against five eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis arrayed above that square doorway. He would have to fight off all of them all at once.
“What do I do!?” he screamed at siblings.
“Just stab the damned things!” Moteah cried.
Mandri shrugged off his pack and let Obo fall heedlessly to the floor. The beetles fluttered their shells against their backs, preparing to jump. Mandri readied himself to stab. Then the world flashed with the white light of purpose. The God’s Eye sight had blinded him.
“Not now!” he screamed as his vision plunged into a swirling sea of iridescent light. He ducked low to the ground and swung his sword wildly in the air. He prayed for Solraheen’s protection—he spoke no words, it was a stronger prayer than that, it was a burst of raw emotion. When the white light bled away it revealed a world in which the hag-beetles had yet to jump. Mandri could see their Sparks floating inside their shells, Sparks of saturated yellow. Shimmering white threads of purpose stretched out of them and wound through the net of fate which fixed the world—four beetle threads ran up to the ceiling. One arced through the air straight at Mandri.
He would have taken it for his doom, but it stopped right in front of his nose. And there was another shimmering thread of purpose arcing there, one which wound out through the doorway and disappeared into the darkness of the throne room. 
The hag-beetle jumped. It sped through the air and its shell parted to let loose its spike, but Mandri did not duck, for he’d caught sight of a giant running through the doorway—a wild eyed giant with a bread-loaf beard. Mandri sighed in awe as Ayram swung his iron spear right through its guiding thread to break the hag-beetle’s back. An eye-blink later and the beetle smashed into the ground with a tremendous crunch.
There stood Ayram. His Spark shone brightly because of course it did, this was Ayram, glorious Ayram, the conquering hero. He even had the Mazidariga child underneath his arm. When he yanked his spear out of the beetle’s belly, the beetle spasmed, its Spark dimmed, and its eight legs and many fingers twitched feebly a moment more.
The four other hag-beetles, seeing this, scurried up to the ceiling and fled back down the hall, following their threads of purpose back towards the Amalgamete.
Ayram dumped the dead Mazidariga next to the dead Obo.
“Get to work,” he grumbled as he brushed past Mandri.
Mandri could not move for he was transfixed by the net of purpose which floated about the room. Thousands of shimmering threads criss-crossed the way towards the Amalgamete, and it seemed that Elrahet was the locus of this creation. Her golden Spark was as bright as the sun, cocooned by threads of purpose. Some of her threads extended out of the room in either direction, and some shot straight up through the ceiling. The sight of it all instilled Mandri with the confidence that they would be victorious, for it was clear to Mandri that her purpose did not end inside this room.
But in truth she was outshone by the Amalgamete, whose Spark was a constellation of shimmering spheres of every size and color, and all of them were webbed together inside his bloated stomach. Mandri watched in wonder as these glowing links pulsed, merged, and split apart, while some knots popped like bubbles into sparkling rainbow dust which coalesced into new lines of purpose that stretched out into the world.
If the Amalgamete were not a god, then he was close to it, for only something divine could build new lines of purpose and set the world into motion. But if he was divine, his flesh was not a suitable vessel. He was lost in the throes of some belly-aching fit. It seemed as if the skinny king on top was about to vomit.
 “A moment!” the Amalgamete shouted. “We have gifts for all of you, if you’ll only wait a moment.”
“Not interested,” Ayram said as he lofted his spear onto his shoulder and stepped towards the evil gathered across the room.
The putrid king’s eyes rolled into white and he punched his body hard enough to knock loose some internal blockage. He moaned and threw his head back as his shoulders cringed and quivered. A cosmic wave rolled under his great bulk and the constellation inside his stomach rolled inside his innards. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder, and the Sparked web was pulled and stretched until a glob or red light snapped loose. When it did, the king above coiled up and screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered.
A boil the size of a wagon wheel burst open. Blackness oozed out of this new cavity, and when the next shudder came this hole ripped wider. Out of this orifice poured a great red lizard demon slathered in tar, Sparked, it seemed, by fire.
Half woman, it stood up on two legs. Half keenkedra, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It wore the muscles of a prize-winning ox, and when it stood up to its full height, it was bigger than Ayram by a head. Its eyes, double lidded, were blood red like its scales, and its pupils reflected the fiery glow of its murderous Spark. 
The beast licked the air with a forked tongue, and it hissed as it stretched out its limbs for the first time—its arms were ribbons of muscle, its back a whip, its jaw was full of hateful fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself and delighted in its power.
It slowly turned and set its glowing eyes on Ayram. It let loose a low, purring hiss. 
In response, the hag beetles all clicked and scratched their spikes inside their shells before turning their dumb, lidless eyes back towards the Ayramun.
Then they began to crawl.
“The Mazid!” Ayram shouted. He twirled his spear under his right arm and spat a challenge towards the newborn freak. A snarl of fangs was the reply, and the lizard demon took one step towards its prey.
The beetles continued to click their excitement while Moto and Moteah herded Mandri and Elrahet into a corner. Mandri dragged Obo and the Riga along by their wrists, though he kept his eyes on the hag-beetles as they scuttled on towards him. The hands at the end of their thin beetle legs slapped the stone like awkward applause. They circled around Ayram and the newborn lizard demon and headed straight for Mandri’s corner. Their numbers on the ceiling swelled. Mandri could just make out the dull shine of eyes as a hag-beetle darted into the darkness directly above him. He could see its yellow Spark clearly, and attached to it was a single thread of inevitable purpose which dropped right down at his feet.
They had to hurry. Elrahet had to wake Obo back up.
Mandri set the two pale bodies right next to each other, and as he rolled the Riga’s shoulder’s flat he noticed that its chest had a spear-sized hole in it. It’s stomach was missing. Obo’s pseudospark was missing.
Mandri looked up at Elrahet, who was so shrouded in the white light of purpose that he wondered if she could even see the gaping wound.
Beyond her, Ayram roared, and the distance between him and the newborn demon was closed so fast that it seemed only a single leap. The thunder clap of their meeting unleashed chaos in the room. So much happened so fast that Mandri couldn’t keep track.
Down on the floor, three hag-beetles jumped at once—maybe it was more, Mandri wasn’t sure because the rush of bodies, limbs, and twisting threads of fate blurred all motion beyond bewilderment. At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. And before Mandri could raise his sword, Moto pivoted and brought his own blade down on the hag beetle’s back. In a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue behind the beetle’s head.
This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him. Though its head tumbled to the floor, its body wasn’t fully dead, instead it seized up, and one of its human-handfeet slapped Mandri in the cheek.
Mandri would have laughed if it weren’t for the sight of a hag beetle up on the ceiling dropping down—things seemed to fall faster when they were falling straight at him.
The beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri’s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle’s neck into Mandri’s face. But this was not enough to obscure his sight of the lines of purpose. One of these white filaments extended out from the attacking beetle’s back and ran a worrisome arc right through the center of Mandri’s forehead.
The beetle’s spike flew out of its back, and thanks to the guiding light, Mandri was able to twist his head out of the way.
The spike retracted, then struck out again, and Mandri ducked again, careful to keep his ear out of the bright white arc which mapped the spike’s path through the future.
Mandri laughed, because he felt like he was cheating, and twice more, the bumbling spike tapped against the stone next to his cheek.
“Idiot!” Mandri shouted.
The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that its lidless saucer eyes were staring right down at him.
“Sorry!”
Mandri tugged hard on the dead beetle body between them, and as the spike flew down once more it met instead with the dead beetle’s shell. Mandri hid himself beneath this carapace as the beetle above tried to smash through it, and he hid like this until, by the grace of Solraheen, that dumb beetle’s head was severed and fell right in front of his nose.
Moteah pulled her sword out of it.
“Get up!” she urged.
Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles, but his hips and thighs were pinned. 
“Kick it off me!”
Moteah kicked the top beetle and Mandri was able to push himself free from the other. He got to his feet and wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage—eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smashed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back across the hall. One of these hags ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the newborn demon, and that beetle was sliced in half by the lizard’s thrashing tail.
Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his iron spear so fast that it seemed to curve, and it snapped suddenly straight against the lizard’s fending tail. Sparks flew, the demon recoiled and raged, then it leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand. Ayram sidestepped, and the demon followed through with its tail to knock Ayram’s spear aside just as the next spinning set of talons were coming round.
Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below a beheading blow, and leapt away, leaving nothing but a swirl of dust between them.
Not only were their movements fraught with impressive power, but their limbs traced through swirling white arcs of purpose. It was a moving image which melted Mandri’s mind. He resolved then and there to apologize to Moto if they ever made it through this alive, as this fight was indeed a work of wondrous art, as captivating as any other, as revealing, as honest, and it had him rapt in core-collapsing wonder. And when the giants paused their brawl to gather themselves, Mandri saw how badly they’d ravaged each other. 
The demon’s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram’s robe was half-clawed off and ribbons of his flesh hung down his side, exposing the yellow fat, the red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time he exhaled. 
The swirl of white light that was Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked Moteah’s rump.
“Help him!” she shouted.
Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag beetles easily enough, but this newborn was an enemy beyond them.
“Go!” Elrahet screamed.
Moteah took off running towards the battle, her purpose clear. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first. He followed, and they got halfway towards Ayram when the demon noticed them. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and crouched down like a cat to retreat back down the hall. Its long tail was raised like that of a scorpion. 
Elrahet turned to Mandri and drew her golden blade. He could not see her face through the bright white shroud of purpose. Her hand trembled as it lifted the knife up above her head.
Mandri panicked. “What are you doing?!”
The old witch thrust her knife downwards in a swift stroke.
But it was not aimed at Mandri.
She brought it down upon her own bright purpose, and the golden blade, curved and gleaming, sliced right through the shimmering threads. The frayed ends splayed out into a tufted cloud, and Elrahet emerged from this mist clad in her usual black robed, leathery self. An eye blink later, and she was completely free of all divine light, save for the light of her Spark. It had only taken one swift cut to unwed herself from the world.
She smiled at Mandri, a gummy, toothless smile. Mandri was utterly confused as to what this could possibly mean, but there was no time to wonder, for in the distance behind Elrahet he saw the newborn jump all the way to the ceiling. Its arc carried it over the heads of the three warriors, and it hit the ground running straight for Mandri and Elrahet.
Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled hiss underneath its permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift strides, and its final leap was tremendous. The sheer size of it could crush them both, but curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery—Ayram’s spear.
The demon rolled under it.
Ayram missed.
In committing himself to the blow he’d left himself open to the lizard’s scything tail, which did not miss—it ripped a gash across Ayram’s chest.
The lizard demon then crashed into Mandri and Elrahet and sent them sprawling. 
When Mandri recovered a moment later, he expected to feel the demon hollowing out his head, but the demon’s great arm lay atop him, lifeless. Elrahet’s golden blade was hilted in the top of its skull.
Mandri struggled to push himself out from under the dead demon. Elrahet was lying on the demon’s other side. Mandri’s own sword sticking out of her stomach. A chill of horror crawled through Mandri’s skin as realized he must have accidentally stabbed her in the flurry. He rushed over and tried to help, but could tell from the absence of breath that she was already dead.
A gargling gasp sounded from behind, and Mandri spun in fright. There was Ayram. Ayram and a river of blood flowing out from the fissure in his chest. Ayram gasped again and he dropped to his knees, then fell backwards. Moto, sprinting up from behind, caught the giant’s fall. Moteah was there too, though she kept on running, and when she caught sight of Elrahet dead by Mandri’s sword, grief and hopelessness broke her.
She huddled over Elrahet. Her shaking hands could not believe the blood which wet the witch’s robes. She wiped the blood away with her own robe, then gently brushed Elrahet’s hair with dewy eyed devotion.
“They come!” Moto hollered. He lay Ayram down before turning to face the onrushing beetle horde.
“Let them come,” Moteah said as she gnashed her teeth and fought back tears. But she thought better of it when her brother shrieked in pain as his leg was sliced by a hag-beetle’s stabbing spine. She picked up her sword again, roared her fighting fury, and then ran to join her brother’s futile act of bravery and defiance.
Mandri stayed by Elrahet’s side. Her golden Spark was still there—his sword was stuck right through it. And there was still one thread of purpose sprouting out of it. It was thin, almost invisible, and it was tethered to Mandri.
Mandri pulled his sword out of her belly and cast it aside. Then set his lips to her wound, and he sucked her Spark into his mouth. This pure divinity sloshed atop his tongue and the taste of it filled his whole being with ecstasy. The urge to swallow was overwhelming, but that was not what he was meant to do, for a thread of purpose tethered him to Obo’s corpse, and it was shining bright.
Mandri hustled over to Obo’s lifeless body and squeezed his jaw open. He spit Elrahet’s Spark into the Mazid’s mouth. He drew back, hoping that he was done and that Obo would rise, but the Spark simply puddled in the back of Obo’s throat and did nothing.
Mandri recalled how Elrahet had muttered some guttural speech to bring Obo back after Minting rock. It was something like Old Jandri. 
He didn’t know any Old Jandri.
He didn’t know any invocations or incantations which might reweave the threads of purpose, or direct a Spark to his will. The only sacred words he knew were from that pre-meal Solitant prayer, a prayer that wasn’t life affirming, it was life denying. Embedded in it was the thought that life is a terrifying thing. Life kills. Life kills, and it eats what it kills, and for some reason, people fear death. Yes, that is what makes life, life—it kills and eats, and it kills and it eats. One should not fear death, fear life!

Consumed by the body
	So that it can
Feed the Spark
	So that it can
Move the flesh
	So that it can be

It was a mantra which could only be completed when repeated. Mandri spoke it, and he repeated it, and as he whispered it to Elrahet’s Spark he willed it to move with his feeling. To his delight, a tiny thread of purpose stretched out of that Spark and wandered down Obo’s throat. It wiggled like a worm seeking sustenance. Mandri wasn’t sure whether his ritual refrain or his raw desire drew that thread into being, so he continued on doing both, and he strained with the effort. The harder he focused, and the more he lost himself in the flow of words and emotion, the further the thread traveled on. It went taut when it hit the Mazid’s stomach, and suddenly the shimmering gold Spark zipped down to take up residence in Obo’s belly.
 Obo’s whole body pulsed with light, and he awoke with a fresh face, and bright eyes, as if nothing had happened at all.
He sat up, alert as ever.
“Hello Mandri. What did I miss?”
Mandri simply pointed down the hall, where Moto and Moteah had their backs against the wall, surrounded by a gang of beetles.
“Oh,” said Obo, and as casually as the sun defeats the night, he opened his mouth and shot a golden beam of Mazidfire through the room. He swiped it in a downwards arc, and all at once, a line of twelve  hag-beetles were cut in half.
The Amalgamete unleashed a dreadful, squelching scream.
“AIIIEEEEEEEEEGHHhhhhghghh!”
He was not at all pleased to see Obo burn his children. And he was not at all pleased to find himself afraid. And upon this afeard and fearsome beast, Obo let loose a powerful bolt of purging fire. The flame merely smashed into the Amalgamete’s flesh and fizzled, leaving only a scorch mark.
The beast laughed as if tickled, but Obo resummoned his flame, and this time he held it steady. He held that beam so long that his own throat heated up to incandescence. This roaring flame was a relentless lance, and it popped through one of the Amalgamete’s great sores. It poured into the demon king’s stomach, heated the insides, boiled them up until sputtering, bubbling blobs of super-heated bile splashed out. Up above, a hiss of steam shot out of the putrid king’s throat, and when Obo finally calmed his fire, the whole beast slumped down, deflated. It appeared to melt into a simmering puddle of its own black bile and blood.
The Amalgamete was dead.
What beetles were still alive went scurrying into the darkness beyond. Obo was content to rub his throat and watch them leave. Meanwhile, Moteah collapsed in exhaustion. Moto shook his head in disbelief at the dead Amalgamete.
Then he eyed Obo and snorted. He seemed as displeased to see the Obo moving as he was pleased at the sight of his boot kicking a hag beetle’s head across the floor.
Obo asked him, “Why so upset? Would you prefer to have lost?”
“We have lost!” Moto shouted. “Ayram is dead! Elrahet is dead!”
“So?”
“So? SO!? That witch was the last vestige of Solraheen’s grace on this earth. She battled evil for untold ages, and now she’s gone. She is gone, and her enemy still lives.”
“You are referring to Schisol’s Shadow?”
“Who else?
Moto’s question went unanswered, but not because it flustered Obo. Obo was simply unconcerned. But Mandri was very much concerned. He’d played too big a role in all this for it to end badly. Guilt forced him to blurt out, “Why not kill the other witch? Schisol’s Shadow, I mean. We have Obo, we have his Mazidfire. Let’s find her and kill her.”
Obo said, “That sounds like a reasonable solution.”
“You can’t kill her,” Moto said. His calm delivery belied the fact that his frustration was boiling over. “She wasn’t supposed to die!”
“Then how did Mandri manage it?”
The tension in Moto’s shoulders snapped, and he stammered out a meek, “I have no idea.” 
Mandri snickered and gathered himself together. He picked up Obo’s litter and carried it over to the Mazid, then patted him on the shoulder. “Let me carry you for another while,” Mandri said. “Let’s go find another enemy to burn.”
Obo smiled and climbed into the litter.
“What about you two?” Mandri asked the siblings. “Are you coming?”
“Coming where?”
Mandri shrugged. “I’m sure Shis can’t be far away. There’s got to be a demon hole in the ground around here somewhere. Come on, what else are you going to do? This is what you’re here for, right? Ending evil? Well, let’s end it.”
Before Mandri left the room, he yanked Elrahet’s golden knife from out of the lizard demon’s head. With this, he hoped to shape the future.</Text>

            <Title>Obo's Story</Title>
            <Text>During the brief rest period each night, one of the Ayramun would tell a story. The fourth night, Moteah asked Mandri for a story, and Mandri offered the spot to Obo. No one else wanted to hear the Mazid tell a story until Moto claimed that it was impossible for Obo to tell a story, as a good story requires a Spark to tell it. Now that everyone was wondering whether or not Obo could tell a good story, he was allowed.
“My story is about a witch,” he said.
He gave Elrahet with a furtive smile. “Maybe you knew her.”
She grumbled, and he continued on.
“This witch was a cantankerous witch who dwelt in a cave where the sea meets the desert. She gained fame throughout the land for her talent of divination. To leverage her talents, a person must first catch a karkoot lizard, put its stomach in a jar of brine, then bring that stomach to the witch in her wilderness cave. In return, the witch would foretell the future. So great were her talents that people hunted karkoots until there were none left, though that’s not what this story is about—that is an aside meant to highlight the shortsightedness of human beings.”
Several groans erupted from amongst the Ayramun. Satisfied with these, Obo smiled and continued on.
“One day a young man went to see this witch. But this story begins long before that day. The story begins with the boy’s father. His father, the carpenter, wasn’t rich, for he was a carpenter. Woe betide him, his son was a profligate child—that means he was wasteful. Whether it was beer, women, or friends, he spent his father’s money without caring. He had no respect for his father’s work. In a way, you can’t blame the boy, he was too young to understand how hard his father worked. But the father did work. He worked hard to pay for his son’s schooling in a richer city. He hoped that his son would surpass him in society.
“So, the son, living in a different city, took his father’s money, money meant for his education, and he spent it on beer, women, and friends. His life’s prospects quickly come to nothing. When the father finds out that his own son had beggared them both, his rage—his rage was profound. It might be hard for any here to understand because none of you, as I understand, have children—”
“Neither do you,” said Mandri.
“Yes, but you see, we Mazidai are supremely empathetic creatures—not that you aren’t, it is simply different. Let me try to paint the father’s rage for you. Given the rough nature of our present circumstances, and perhaps the ultimate goal of our quest as we seek to kill a demon who seeks to end creation, you all must have some sympathy for the idea that existence is some kind of mistake. It lacks purpose. Contrast that with me, a Mazid—not only was I built for an explicit purpose, I know what it is. You, however, must have a nagging sense of the absence of yours. At least we can say that it is not at all clear what that purpose is—don’t the Solitants admit as much? I would argue that it is clearly obvious that you have no purpose, and I can prove it.”
Moto groaned and said, “I told you he can’t tell a story.”
“If a human ever finds themself blessed with wealth and health beyond comprehension, what happens to them? I can tell you what happens, as I’ve seen first hand how impoverishing wealth is when your kind gets it. I’ve seen through the eyes of the Hrkan Lords. Without any practical concerns to distract them, one might think they would be happy, for they are free to pursue their life’s true purpose. But that’s not what happens! They are not happy, they are bored. Totally bored. It is a boredom so thorough and complete that some kill themselves. That might be hard for you to fathom, but I speak the truth. Their boredom is complete. And what does it all mean? If a person, freed from the indignities of life, turns, naturally, to boredom, what does that mean? It means that your natural rest state is nothingness, and that you have no intrinsic purpose. If you did have one, surely your natural state would reflect it.”
“What does any of this have to do with the carpenter?” Moteah asked.
“This is the backdrop to every story ever told. You see, because you have no natural purpose, what purpose you do have is crafted, and that means it is something you can lose. And I put it to you that losing your purpose is the greatest horror a human can experience. Don’t smile, Mandri, you of all people should know this. You are so scared to lose your purpose that you won’t even stick to one in the first place. You are sitting firmly in that quarter of all people who got burnt when they were young and that little jab of horror has tranquilized them for the rest of their lives. You are little better than that quarter of all people who are so inured to the vagaries of life that they don’t ever think about their purpose at all. Then there’s the rest of you,” he said, looking out at the Ayramun, challenging them. Ayram caught it and said, “If there’s a purpose to this story, Mazid, you best get to it.”
“Most people make their family their purpose. The carpenter was such a man. His son was his purpose in life. To borrow a figurative turn from the poet Lovraleen, his son was his challenge to the nothingness inside him. And he lost. And worse, it wasn’t taken from him, it was squandered. If his son were killed, the man could have moved into grief, but no, the father had challenged the void and the void had answered back by corrupting his son and turning him into the living embodiment of a life’s wasted labor. At least, that’s how the father saw it. How could he see it differently? As Seb might say, the carpenter was who he was. And what did he do? He put his carpentry to work—he made a coffin and sent it with a messenger to his son. Inside that coffin was a note from the father which said, ‘You are going to die’. 
“To put it lightly, this message greatly disturbed the son. He might have been a wastrel, but a self-obsessed wastrel was he—he didn’t want to die. He saw the coffin and the note and was scared. He knew his father to be a man of resolve. He began to see his old man in every shadow. He couldn’t enjoy himself. He couldn’t go to the tavern, or the whorehouse, and he couldn’t sleep in the same place twice. This was no way to live, so what did he do? Since he was a wastrel he couldn’t confront even the thought of a confrontation, so he decided to run away and find a witch to fix his problem for him. If a witch could predict his future killing, then he could, he hoped, avoid it. 
“So, he found a karkoot lizard, stuck its stomach in a jar of brine, and set off to see the cantankerous old witch by the sea.
“When the wastrel finally set foot in the witch’s cave, he said to her, ‘My own father is trying to kill me. What should I do?’ Unfortunately for him, this was the wrong kind of question to ask, because the old witch dealt with facts, not advice. She wanted to hear questions like, ‘What will happen on the third full moon of the month?’, or, ‘When will the rains come?’, that sort of thing, not ‘What should I do?’. Whenever she was asked such a question, she’d put no effort into the answer. She smoked up, and she did a song and dance for the wastrel son, and when she was done she said to him, ‘When you leave this place, the first thought that enters your head is what you will do’.”
Seb asked, “Can you say that again?”
“Certainly. The witch said, ‘When you leave this place, the first thought that enters your head is what you will do’. It was obscenely ambiguous, but that was the point. You see, this witch was old and long in the trade, and she knew what kind of customer the boy was and how her response would weigh on him. It was her way of causing him torment. And torment him it did, for he jumped to the conclusion that his father was waiting for him outside the cave, and that the ‘first thought’ that would enter his head would be his father’s cudgel, and what he would ‘do’ was die. So he didn’t leave. He stayed right there in that witch’s cave and refused to leave.
“The witch’s plan had backfired. The witch tried in vain to shoo him out. She was stuck with this wastrel who was convinced that the moment he left her cave, he would be struck dead. The witch tried to tell him that his father couldn’t be sitting right outside her cave for all eternity, but the son didn’t buy it. It’s not that he thought his father was always watching the cave, but he believed with certainty that whenever he did decide to leave, that’s precisely when his father would show up.
“The witch eventually gave up trying to convince the boy that he could safely leave, and she told him that he could stay if he did chores for her, like scrubbing the cave floor, making fires, cooking, and whatnot. So the son stayed. After many, many years of this arrangement, the witch eventually died, and the carpenter’s son succeeded her because he had been, effectively, the witch’s apprentice. He had learned how to divine the future by watching the witch read the folds in fish stomachs. He had, on accident, become his own man with his own profession. The witch was dead, but people kept coming to the cave regardless. It is said that this wastrel’s divinations transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, for even kings would seek his sight to plan the courses of their wars.
“The great irony of all this is that the note the carpenter sent to his son was not a threat. If you remember, the note in the coffin said, ‘You are going to die’—that was a mere statement of fact, everybody dies. The father had no intention of hunting down his son. For the father, the knowledge of death is what spurred him to work hard and make the most of every moment, and he had hoped the thought would do the same for son, and it did. It is not known if the father ever discovered that his son had become a great diviner and shaped the course of history, but I like to think that the abatement of his despair would have been most sublime, for he had, unwittingly, triumphed against the void.” 
A silence set in around the smokeless fire. No one wanted to admit it, but the story wasn’t half-bad.
Mandri said, “I wonder if the witch knew that the wastrel son would become her successor.”
“Of course she did,” said Seb. “She’s a diviner. She divined the future and knew what to say to make it work. The idiot kid was as much her kid as the carpenter’s.”
Moteah said, “It’s part of the telling, Mandri, don’t think too much about it.”
“Well, it’s a poor telling.”
Obo’s eyes lit up. “You think you can do better?”
“I do.”
“Then let us hear it.”
“I know a story about a son. A godly son. Upright in his parent’s eyes and in Solraheen’s. That is, until the day he met a girl.”
“Typical,” Moteah groaned.
“It’s a good story,” Mandri protested. 
But nobody wanted to hear it. They all laid down to rest, leaving Mandri full of resentment. His story was one told to him when he was twelve. He still remembered the Solitant priest, a man with clean white hair, sweptback behind the ears, and Mandri still remembered how the priest upholstered his story with eloquence.
He spoke of seductive demonettes. 
They stroked a young man’s body in the most delicate of embraces
They fondled his uglies with their miscegenate appendages, so as to win a depraved victory over him.
It was a story inspired by the grace of Solraheen, and these Ayramun would love to hear it, for it was a story about how a Spark was saved from the ravages of union with the Dark. In the end, the young man never succumbed to this utmost of temptations—he bit off his tongue, and the incredible pain, coupled with the coldness of death, rescued him from his lust.</Text>

            <Title>Spark</Title>
            <Text>Death is a terrifying thing, but Life is more so. Life kills. Life kills, and it eats what it kills, and for some reason, people fear death. As any well-studied Solitant student can see, do not fear death, fear life! 
There is a tribe in the Baree lowlands, the Ferzamun, who will not take shade under tree or bush because they believe that bark-fleshed leafy beings survive in the desert by poisoning the air to kill whatever sits underneath. A man falls asleep in that shade, he dies, and his body’s water will sustain the plant for years. His bones, once buried, will fertilize the soil for the next generation.
Living things kill. Living things kill and eat each other. It is believed, by those who seek out demons, that this self-perpetuating cycle is motivated by the Spark’s desire to be reunite with itself.
Elrahet was no Solitant, and yet she prayed the Solitant’s prayer as she sliced open Ayram’s wrist and sipped his flesh.

Consumed by the body
	So that it can
Feed the Spark
	So that it can
Move the flesh
	So that it can be
Consumed by the body

She spoke the words in Old Jandri, and though that guttural speech was strange to Mandri’s ears, he knew them by their cadence. She did not invite anyone else to partake. 
When she was finished, she closed Ayram’s eyes, and that was truly the end of him. And with him gone, so too went any hope of a crowning future.
“What do we do?” Purl asked. Her face was drawn and her hair, frazzled and streaked in hag beetle blood.
“We keep going,” said Moteah. She’d made it through the battle without a scratch and yet . Try to salvage the situation against sense. She said, “For Ayram’s sake we keep going. For everyone’s sake. For Solraheen’s sake, we keep going.”
“Go where?” Moto said through clenched teeth and frustrated tears. “Ayram’s dead. Dumb-ass Seb got the Riga’s head split open, so unless Elrahet can pull the Mazid’s Spark out of a spoiled corpse, then we’d have to start over from scratch!”
Mandri recalled the sight of the hag beetle’s spike impaling both Seb and the Riga. The pair were still lying there in a gruesome heap. Could Elrahet still draw the pseudo-Spark from the Riga’s mouth if it had a hag beetle’s spike riping through it? All desperate eyes turned to the witch, but her solemn face could not hide the truth—the Riga was indeed spoiled. Their long mission was at an end.
“We have nothing,” said Moto. “And this is over.” He took a moment to gather his wits and to wipe his cheek of weakness, then he picked up his sword from where he’d dropped it. He pointed that blade towards the unconscious Amalgamete down the hall, who still impressed terror in the light of the two blazing braziers.
“I’m going to carve up that beast,” said Moto, “And then I’m leaving. If anyone wants to follow, they can. But I’m not Ayram. There is no ‘me and mine’.”
When Moteah did not follow, he paused and beckoned to his sister. 
“Come,” he said. “We’re leaving.”
Moteah was still in shock. “This can’t be it,” she said. “This is all supposed to mean something. This can’t be the end.”
She reached out towards Ayram and brushed his shoulder. A sob welled up in her throat and she stifled it down with a fluttering breath. Then she stood up and followed her brother, leaving Mandri, Purl, and Elrahet behind.
“It’s all my fault,” said a glassy-eyed Purl, her voice unfeeling, her features numbed by exhaustion. 
Elrahet said nothing as Purl stood up silently and followed after Moto. It was Mandri that her bony finger pointed out.
“Grab the legless Mazid,” she said. “And Purl! Fetch my needle and string.”
She picked up her walking stick hand pushed past Mandri, pushed past Moto, heading towards the Amalgamete.
“Hurry up!” she yelled. Her tone brooked no argument.
Mandri ran over to the dark corner of the hall, where he’d shed his pack. Obo was still squished inside. He pulled up on the stubby arms and Obo slid out, pale as ever, limp, naked and legless. He had an inkling of what was happening here.
He hauled Obo’s body down the hall to where the others stood waiting. The flaming braziers cast their shadows against that horrifying cake of flesh that was the Amalgamete, and sprouting out above them was the green-robed figure of the old king Greskal. He was still unconscious, and he snored loudly through a phlegm-choked throat.
Elrahet said to Moto “Cut him open. Right here.” She pointed towards the center of the Amalgamete’s stomach with her stick and drew a line
“Are you sure this is a good idea?” Moto asked.
He regretted his words as soon as he said them for he’d drawn the witch’s gaze. He’d thought her eyes were merely brown, but they were flecked with gold, and her twisted brow set them into a feral glare which filled him with a sense of being uncovered, caught out, and that his next move would be his last. Nothing he could do could ever surprise her.
Thankfully Moto drew her away when he said, “If that Mazid is given a Spark, it could kill us all.”
“Thank you Moto,” said Elrahet sarcastically. “I hadn’t considered that. Now cut the demon open.”
Moto stepped forth and stabbed. His face was full of anger. He twisted the blade before he pulled his slice, and as he did, the tension in that great canvas of flesh snapped and a black pool of viscera poured out. Up above, Greskal let loose a horrid whine, though he stayed fixed in his nightmare sleep.
“Bring me the Mazid,” said Elrahet.
Mandri brought Obo forth.
Elrahet studied the Amalgamete’s fluids as they pooled and advanced along the grouted grooves in the floor. Black chunks of half-digested , and these she studied carefully as if looking for some particular fleck of meat. She said, “I will do a thing which has not been done for as long as I can remember.” Her eyes flicked to Obo’s corpse. “I am going to give a thing a Spark.”
She yanked Obo from Mandri’s grip then stepped onto the lowest flap of fat as if it were a stair. She lifted the heavy flap of skin which hung over the Amalgamete’s gaping stomach. She stuffed the Mazid inside. Purl then handed over the bone needle and wicked flax thread, and with these Elrahet proceeded to sew the skin back together. Her needlework was crude, and the uneven sutures did little to keep the wound together, but this didn’t bother her. The thread was, it seemed, merely a step in a ritual.
When she’d finished with the needle and thread she tossed them aside, then said, “Back away,” as if any of them needed any urging. 
She then put her hand on the wound and began to pray.
She spoke in an unfamiliar tongue, and her voice cracked and rumbled, lending her words the authority of her age. The more she spoke the quicker her cadence rolled and at the start of the third repeat a gust of wind burst into the hall as if some unseen door had opened above them. This wind was a cold, mountain wind, and it brushed the flames in the two braziers into swirling spires that sparkled white.
This sudden brightness startled Greskal out of his sleep. He looked down and saw what was being done to him, and he let loose a pleading shriek. This discordant note startled Elrahet out of her reverie, and she stumbled back. But her spell was not broken, for whatever door she had opened could not now be closed. The Amalgamete’s stomach seemed to boil and roil inside, and his whole belly shook, ballooned, and finally the sutures were ripped open in a sudden burst, and a black spurt of blood and bile spraying throughout the room.
Mandri shielded his face with his arm. When he looked up again, the old king Greskal lay limp against his bulk and he wind was gone. Lying on the floor, spilled out in that dark amniotic fluid, was Obo, pale skin peeking through that slathered in black.
He was moving.
“Sol’s light,” Obo muttered as he discovered, again, the world. Though he looked like he’d just been spat out the mouth of Shis, he was remarkably calm. He set his bright eyes searching about the room, and they settled on Ayram, dead on the floor near the entrance to the hall.
He looked down at the sludge that slimed his nubby arms. 
He looked behind at the Amalgamete.
Elrahet said, “Sparked flesh is warmer.”
Obo’s eyes went wide. 
“You didn’t,” he said.
“I did.”
Obo with a Spark was his same old unflappable self. He did not scream excitement or cry a tear of glory, he merely observed the new sensations pulsing through his arms and muttered, “Interesting.”
Elrahet stepped forward, foot sliding in the muck, and she said, “About our deal—in exchange for a Spark, you will save Solraheen.”
Obo tried to wipe the muck from his hip, but this only smeared it around.
“Fetch a rag,” said Elrahet out the corner of her mouth. Moto already had one ready and tossed it to Obo. With no hands to catch it, the body-length rag landed on Obo’s head like a shroud.
“Our deal,” Elrahet said. “I give you a Spark, so now you’ll help us free Solraheen.”

Moto was standing off to Obo’s right, frowning deeply, as if the smell was driving him insane—and indeed, it might have been, for that bile was as bad as the rot of death. But what upset Moto ran deeper than foul smell. His, and his hand fussed at the hilt of his sword. 
“You grip your sword too tightly,” said Obo. “It makes me nervous.” And in case his meaning wasn’t clear, he turned his bald head towards Moto, and as he did the pallid skin of his throat flushed gold, and his breath was a spout of flames licking his lips. That was enough send Moto bumbling backwards.
“You lied,” Moto seethed.
“Shouldn’t you be running away?”
“If you’re going to kill us, then kill us!”
Furtive smile. He began again to wipe himself down with the rag as if he’d just come out of a bath, reaching under his arms and around his emaciated side. “I am but one of the Mazidai. The rest of my kind is still in chains, and that is not acceptable to me. So you, Elrahet, your knowledge of the Spark is the most precious thing to me in all the world. I’ll still trade for it.”
“We’ve already made a deal.”
“Your quest is not possible. I’m not going to go and lose my Spark right after I’ve gained it.”
“Sneer?” said Moto.
“Moto,” said Obo, “If you value your life then you’ll treat me with a measure of respect.”
The charge flustered Moto, and when Elrahet didn’t speak up for him, the swashbuckling Zosan shied away.
Elrahet rapped her walking stick on the stone floor and countered, “Would you do it to save your own Spark, then?”
“Are you threatening to take it back?”
he could erase her head if she so much as breathed a witchy word.
“This world turns on a knife’s edge,” Elrahet replied. “If it falls one way instead of the other, then every Spark—yours and mine—will be snuffed out.”
That he was listening.
Elrahet sighed the sigh of an old woman who was tired of having to play with her own thoughts to make them palatable to others. “What do you know about how the world was made?” she asked.
Obo blinked and said, “Nothing.”
With that, she turned away from Obo and began to walk away as if she’d lost all interest.
“Come!” said Elrahet as her cane clicked on the tiles. “Let me show you why you must help. Come!”
“Where are we going?”
“To find a hole in the earth.”

Elrahet did not have to look long for a hole of the type that she was seeking—there was one in the cluttered study that lay adjacent to the throne room—Greskal’s study. A  shield-sized chunk of the floor was missing from its center, and a torn green carpet hung down into the depths. A large upturned table lay canted on the far side of the room, and from this, as well as a scattering of books, Mandri judged that the hole had, somehow, burst up from below. Moto dropped a torch into it, revealing a red rock floor some few meters away.
“Where does that lead?” Mandri asked.
“Where do you think?” said Elrahet.
 Of course, there was only one possible answer—it led to the depths of Shis.

            <Text>Mandri’s sleep-crusted eyelids split open and discovered that he was, somehow, back in little temple’s ladder room. It was dark. He lay quietly, lamenting his reinsertion into life’s causal flow of events.
The God’s Eye burgeon had been that good.
He didn’t remember any of the trip, but he remembered it was good.
When his eyes adjusted to the dimness, he discovered that he had, somehow, been brought back up to the temple’s ladder room. It was empty, save for him. The tumble of burned-out twigs were there, and the Ayramun’s packs were still there, so he hadn’t been left behind. He decided to climb the ladder and see if anyone was lounging around outside. He hoped someone was preparing a meal. The passing of the God’s Eye burgeon had left him hungry.
He climbed up the ladder’s rungs and as he moved the soreness in his body quickly worked itself out.
That must have been the work of the God’s Eye burgeon, too.
He decided to ask Seb about it as soon as he got the chance, but that would be all he would ask—he would pretend to remember everything that had happened down in that cave, including walking up into the little temple proper, because he didn’t want to give Seb the impression that he couldn’t handle a single sliver of that beautiful burgeon.
Mandri pulled himself up onto the cobbled black stone of the tiny desert temple floor. He kept calling it a temple, but there was no altar or kneeling stone—only that hole in the ground and the wooden ladder. There was a scrawl of Old Jandri script circumscribing the inner dome, but Mandri couldn’t read it. He guessed it told of the life of some dead desert father who’d died here and was buried in a crypt somewhere down below.
He stepped out into the cool evening air. With the heat of the day behind them, he assumed they would be moving again.
All of the Ayramun were gathered at the top of the nearest hill to his right. They stood with backs turned, facing west, facing the setting sun. They were a remarkable set of outland pokes of all different sizes, and with Obo included, still strapped in his litter and leaning against Ayram’s leg, they ranged from legless to the largest. Only Seb, at the end of the line, turned and regarded Mandri’s presence. This she did with a smirk and a wink, and Mandri felt compelled to return the courtesy. 
Mandri scrambled up the hill to join her, and as soon as he arrived at the top of that dune hill, all schemes of stealing Seb’s God’s Eye burgeons fled from thought, for it was not the setting sun which stretched out above the distant horizon, but a heavy cloud as dark as the oncoming night. And it was more than a cloud, it was the Lord of clouds for it stretched out across the world and churned it over. It could have been mistaken for a rampaging herd of mountains, if such a thing were possible. Mandri was struck by its color, for its upper reaches pierced the shadow of the world's edge to catch the fleeing light of day—at the top, a rim-lit tip of gold, blurring into pink, oozing into red, while the cloud’s body was a dusty wall of reddish-black stretching all the way down to the desert floor.
The storm’s magnificence was helped along by little westwind zephyrs tickling Mandri’s skin. So far as he could tell, this behemoth was lumbering straight towards them. It took his breath away.
Seb was standing next to Mandri, arms crossed, and for once she wasn’t chewing a spine—it hung there on her lip, forgotten.
“Big ‘ol bastard, ain’t it?”
This storm was much bigger than that. It was an Ugmukheen, a child of Mukh, inheritor of His wrath. To Mandri’s knowledge, the Sand hadn’t seen a storm anywhere near that size for at least three hundred years, back when Mukh was still alive.
Obo was as taken by the sight of the storm as everyone else.
“It is unnatural,” he said with something like wonder. This was the most honest emotion Mandri had heard Obo utter.
“Of course it’s natural,” Seb said. “Everything that happens is natural.”
“It comes from an impossible direction,” said Obo.
Moto peaked around Ayram’s figure so that he could sneer at the Mazid. “What would you know about the Ugmukheen?”
Obo countered by saying, “I’ve read every book and scroll that accounts the weather in this part of the world, and every Ugmukheen for the past thousand years was born abreast the Gongee Sea.”
“So?”
“When the high Gongee winds stop blowing, it’s like taking the lid off a pot of steaming water. That’s how such storms are made. And the Gongee Sea is four days to the south, not to the west. That’s not to mention that an Ugmukheen does not look like that.”
“Clearly,” said Moto, jealous of Obo’s learning, “They do look like that.”
Obo asked, “Have you ever seen an Ugmukheen before?”
“No. Have you?”
“I’ve read reports from those who have.”
Moto snorted, shook his head, and looked for support from the rest of the Ayramun, but everyone was transfixed by the storm.
“The Mazid speaks truth,” said Ayram. “A real Ugmukheen isn’t a wall of sand, it’s a mist. The first you know of it is when your own dust breathes down your neck. You might survive an Ugmukheen, but you can’t survive a thing like that.” He jabbed his iron spear towards the distant tempest and added, “A storm like that would flay my hide. That’s no Ugmukheen.”
Brooding Elrahet pulled her shawl tight and said, “Every god who could have brought such a storm upon the world is long dead.”
Seb said, “We can’t walk with that beast runnin’ us down.”
Elrahet nodded. “We stay in the hole. And we pray to all that is holy that these hills don’t swallow us before the Amalgamete gets its chance.”
Seb said, “There’s got to be another way.”
“We could try south,” said Moteah. “The Kari plain. Get out of its way.”
Ayram shook his head and stroked his beard. “Won’t have time. We stay in the hole until it passes.”
“What about the Hrks?” Moto cautioned. “If we don’t keep moving, they’ll catch us long before we reach Bullr.”
“Could try the Goree Pass,” said Seb.
“The Goree Pass…” Ayram repeated as his fingers twirled his beard.
“The Pass will never work,” said Moto.
“Says you,” said Seb as she mocked Moto’s characteristic snort.
Moto clicked his tongue. “The Goree Pass is cursed,” he declared, meeting Seb’s taunting gaze. “It’s as cursed as that damned storm.”
“Not cursed enough for the Greskal and the Greskalun.”
“It don’t matter who lives there. Sol’s light, it don’t matter if it’s cursed! The Pass is straight south of a Hrkan garrison. There’ll be Mazidariga sniffing all through it long before we get there.” 
Judging by the silence that followed, this was a good point. Seb didn’t like it. Mandri could hear her thinking because she’d started chewing her spine again, and she was munching hard, as if her thoughts were a water wheel spinning her jaw into action.
She said, “If the storm cuts north after blowin’ over, it’ll stop the Hrks from goin’ south. We could head for the Goree Pass to the south without a care.”
“What if it doesn’t curve north?”
Seb huffed. She had no answer to that, and she almost seemed angry about it. But in the end, her argument was saved by Ayram.
“I like the Goree Pass,” he said. “The Greskalun could keep the Hrks off our tail for a time. Greskal man hates Hrk as much as anyone.”
Every time Ayram pulled at his beard and twirled out a tuft of hair, the hair sprang right back into that smooth, bread-loaf shape. The hair on Ayram’s head gave his face a fuzzy aspect, probably because all of his features were over sized while the individual hairs were as small as anyone else’s, and they were as dense as felt.
“We’ll make for the Goree Pass,” Ayram finally declared. “We wait out the storm here in the hole, then skip the bones, and we head straight for the Goree.”
With that, he picked up Obo’s litter, then turned and side-step shuffled back down the hill. Moto stamped after him, fretting about this change of plans. Of the rest of the Ayramun, Moteah seemed the most unaffected. She was standing on a black rock which put her up a foot higher than the rest. She had a long reedy stick which she’d brought with her from the western plain below, and with it she drew little abstract faces, and then she’d watch the wind brush them away grain by grain.
Seb was watching the storm looking pleased with herself.
“Well,” Mandri said suggestively, “We suddenly find ourselves in possession of some recreational time.”
Seb patted her pocket, and what-do-you-know, she nodded and wandered back down the hill.
Mandri couldn’t follow too quickly as he’d arouse too much suspicion. Elrahet would probably ask why he wanted to waste the day with Seb. He counted to ten, then said, “Well, I’ll just, uh…I’ll go find something to eat.”
He scrambled down the hill to find Seb and burgeons.
Unfortunately, Moto found him first. The man was climbing up the temple ladder just as Mandri was about to climb down.
“Where are you going?” he asked as he climbed up onto the temple tile.
“To find a snack.”
“No free food until you show me you can earn your keep.”
In his hand was a Hrkan short sword stuck in a tawny scabbard that had been salvaged from the battle of Minting Rock. Moto extended this out towards Mandri, hilt first, clearly expecting Mandri to take it.
“I can’t imagine what you’d want me to do with this,” Mandri said. “Need me to chop a lizard for you?”
Moto was not amused. “Do you remember our conversation?”
“Nope,” said Mandri, biting his tongue.
“I remember it,” Moto said. “I was teaching you what men are made for—solving problems. I think it ended with you getting a bite on your leg.” Moto’s head tilted as if he were interrogating Mandri’s Spark. “I was going easy on you then. Now that you’re out here with us, I’ll be difficult. Take the damned sword.”
Mandri hesitated, but the man was serious, so he grabbed the sword and followed Moto back outside. The burgeons would have to wait.
Obo was outside as well, propped against the temple’s wall. Moto stopped in front of him and said, “You could learn something and pass it on to your Hrkan Lords. Their Skulsi are shitty fighters.”
“Yes, I heard how you and Ayram cut them down.”
“They’re brave,” Moto said as he moved on. “I’ll give them that.”
“Too brave,” said Obo.
“You’d rather they be cowards?”
Obo looked so strange, swaddled up like he was, the size of an overgrown baby but with the face of an ageless eunuch. Stranger still to see him adopt the air of a lecturer and say, “In the Hrkan art of war, there is no such thing as cowardice. There’s no such thing as bravery, either, for bravery and cowardice are both symptoms of a disease called unpreparedness. In war there is only preparedness, and unpreparedness. If a soldier is ever called on to be brave or a coward, then his commander has failed him.”
“Of all the shadows from Shis,” Moto muttered. “What are you talking about?”
Obo continued on, as if reciting some long-remembered scripture, “ Either the fighting man is fully prepared for what he faces and is victorious, or his commander has failed. Such a commander must kill himself.”
Moto strode several paces away, then drew his gold-hilted sword with a flourish. “You can be as prepared as you can possibly be for a fight, but still face bad odds.” He flicked the air with his blade. “That’s what calls for bravery.”
Obo lectured on. “If a commander’s soldiers face unbalanced odds, then the commander has failed in his maneuvers and his men have arrived to battle under prepared. Such a commander should kill himself.” He lowered his aloof airs and added, “These are not my words, they are Lord Kashkan’s.”
Moto swish-flicked his sword through the air in front of Mandri’s belly, as if slicing through Lord Kashkan’s guidance. “Lesson number one,” he said, addressing Mandri. “Don’t ever listen to a Hrk.”
“I already don’t,” Mandri replied.
“Lesson number two—always run away from a fight if you can.”
Mandri dropped his sword in the dirt. 
“He’s a prodigy,” Obo declared. 
“Very cute,” said Moto, eyes narrowing in irritation.  “Pick up your sword.”
“You know,” said Mandri, “The hand you people stole from me was my dominant hand.”
“It doesn’t matter.”
Moto switched his sword to his left hand and showed off his skill with another dexterous swish-flick and slice. The man was quite adept at slaying air.
“Shouldn’t I focus on being a Minder?”
“That’s what I’m helping you to do,” Moto said. “You can’t Mind the Mazid because you can’t Mind yourself. The fighting life cures a man of that dullness. And when you’re sharp, strong, you’ll get a taste of what it’s like to move a man against his will. It is the greatest feeling in all the world. From there, moving a Mazid should be no different.”
“Alright, I’ll play.
 Mandri said this to have it over with, because he didn’t think he could out-stubborn a man like Moto .
“Pick up your sword,” Moto commanded.
Mandri picked it up. Its heft felt awkward in his left hand. Its blade was dark like Ayram’s spear, though its single-edged blade was bright like silver, two-hands long, and it was thick, heavy, more like a cleaver than a sword.
“Now,” said Moto. “If you’re in a fight, what are you trying to do?”
“Survive?”
“Be more specific.”
“Run away.”
Moto sighed. “In the event where you must fight, what should you try to do? Be specific.”
“How can I be specific when I don’t know who I’m fighting?”
Moto’s eager shoulders grew more sullen with each exchange. He sighed again and said, “You are fighting a Skulsi.”
“Well then I’ll stab him before he stabs me.”
“Be more specific.”
“I’ll stab him in the uglies?”
“Mandri…you said you were a painter, yes? When you paint a portrait, what is the first thing you are trying to do?”
“I can’t see how that has anything to do with killing.”
Moto jaw went tight and he grunted, like a pouting child.
Mandri continued on, saying, “There’s nothing artful about killing. And I’ve seen enough killing to know.” His declaration roughened up Moto’s dark face.
“Did I speak of killing?” Moto asked. His question dripped with derision. “I spoke of combat. A fight is a work of art. All artists try to get at the human heart, a man with a sword simply takes the most direct approach. The only difference between a fight and a painting is that the best painter is a matter of opinion, but the best fighter—that is a matter of fact. And before you embarrass yourself with endless denial, think of how you don’t judge the entire art of painting from one child’s scribblings. If you were to see the best fighters in action, you would agree with me.”
“And who is the best? You?”
“I might be.”
“Who would win in a fight, you or Ayram?”
The answer was obvious, but Moto didn’t answer quickly. He snorted disbelief, then rubbed his head in frustration, as if the question was one of those utterances that made semantic sense but signified nothing, a stumbling block for would-be philosophers.
“That question depends on too many things,” he said. “That question lacks context. It isn’t a real question.”
“The context is you versus Ayram.”
Moto’s face went through such an extended series of contortions that he could have charged money to see the act. Somewhere in there was the suggestion that it was offensive to even ask the question. He went through a few different shades of disappointment as well, and it was obvious he was upset with himself for letting things stray too far from the lesson at hand, and upset at Mandri for simply existing. In the end, his face settled into plain old vexation, and he blurted out, “We’re done. If you don’t want help, you won’t get it. Stay weak. You’ll die and we’ll find another Minder.”
Moto stomped past and fled into the temple. Before his head disappeared down the ladder, he paused and said bitterly, “Keep the sword.”
When he was gone, Mandri shared an impish smile with Obo. 
Obo said, “We should probably head down as well, don’t you think?”
“Why?”
“Look at the sky behind you.”
Mandri looked behind and saw the brilliant reds and purples of the approaching storm.
“Oh, right. Almost forgot.”
Mandri sheathed his sword and tucked it into the waist of his robe. He then hauled Obo, still in his litter, into the tiny temple and down the ladder. Once down, he propped Obo up against the wall and wandered off to find Seb, but the idiot had gone to sleep. Instead of enjoying a mind-splitting burgeon, Mandri sat against the wall and waited in boredom with the rest of the Ayramun. It did not take long for the storm to break over them.
First came the shadow as the storm blocked out the setting sun, leaving the air outside suffused with a dim orange glow. Then came the soothing sound of wind-whipped sand splashing against the temple’s bricks above. Every now and then a gust of wind would blow into the temple entrance and swirl around inside, and if the wind was strong enough, it blew through the hole in the floor, turning the ladder room and the tunnel beyond into a sort of flute—the faint whimpering whine sounded startlingly similar to the birthing fits of the brown mutts back in Meskalim.
As the wind intensified, this whine steadied into a droll hum, a sound so annoying that all the Ayramun retreated deeper into the tunnel behind the ladder. Only Mandrameen and Obo stayed in the ladder room. Obo was there because no one could be bothered to pick him up and move him. Mandri stayed because he was mesmerized by the sight and sound of the storm outside. Being near to a monstrous, blossoming power was intoxicating.
“I wonder what caused it?” Mandri wondered as the blackness settled in. The room had no fire, and that was fine, because the energy from the storm outside was somehow a comfort. It made Mandri feel squeezed in, bottled up.
“You think it was sent by the Amalgamete? Does it have this kind of power?”
“I cannot say,” said Obo.
“Maybe it was Solraheen.”
“Solraheen didn’t make this storm. As I’m sure you are aware, He no longer exists amongst the living.”
“He might not have made this particular storm, but He made…you know…He made the structure for it. He made the world that made it. Maybe He even made the Amalgamete.”
“How profound,” Obo said sarcastically.
“It must be Solraheen, even if it wasn’t Him.”
“Do you hear yourself when you speak? Mandri, you make no sense.”
“What I mean is, whatever caused it, there’s a chain that goes back to Solraheen, because He’s the only true creator. Everyone else can only move things around, but that’s not true creation. Solraheen created everything, set it in motion, so it all goes back to Him.”
“Even the Amalgamete?”
“Even the Amalgamete.” 
Mandri was feeling philosophical. All that was missing was some burgeon beer to complete the cozy mood. A nice freeweed wrap would do as well, but he didn’t usually go in for those. The heat of the storm worked a warmness into his skin, and the dimness, coupled with the storm’s humbling immensity, was working wonders on his stress. Satisfying, too, was the knowledge that he didn’t have to do damned thing, at least not for a good long while.
He asked Obo, “Do you have any beliefs? Does a Mazid believe anything?”
“What do you mean?”
“Forget I asked. I’m just happy you’re here with me.”
“I’m touched,” said Obo. Obo’s pale face was the only thing Mandri could really see in this darkness. As the rest of Obo’s body was swaddled in black, his face hovered like a ghost above the ground. He looked delighted.
“I’m happy too,” he said. “Without you I’d be alone amongst these Ayramun, and that would be horrific.”
“Have you given any more thought to our escape?”
“I’ve given up.”
“Why?”
“Where would I go? Back to Hrk? Never. These people, rough as they are, they’re my only chance at freedom. It’s a slim chance that Elrahet gives me a Spark, but she’s the only person in all the world who could.”
The two of them sat in contemplative silence for half a hand. Mandri mulled over Obo’s miserable life. Obo was a creature created to be a slave, a weapon. All he’d known was cruelty and killing. It was a rough deal, like a dog born and bred for the pit.
Mandri felt a swell of goodwill rise up in himself. He wondered if this was some lingering effect of the God’s Eye burgeon. If it was, it didn’t matter, because it was there and there was no ignoring it.
“You know what, Obo? You deserve a Spark more than I do. I’d give you mine if I could.”
“Thank you for saying that.”
“No, I mean it. Maybe I can get you a Spark.”
“How?”
“If Moteah’s right, then they need your Mazidfire. If you’ve got no Minder, then they’ve got no other way to kill the Amalgamete, other than to give you a Spark.”
Obo smiled politely. “Don’t worry about me. I don’t think that’s a productive use of your time.”
“Well, what else am I going to do? Worry about me? My fate is sealed. You said yourself that I don’t have the right stuff to be a Minder. And you’re right, I’m never going to force you to do something you don’t want to do. I’m not a slaver. They’re going to kill me as soon as they figure that out.”
“If someone must be my Minder, I would prefer it would be you.”
“What I truly don’t understand is why they chose me for the job.”
“It is strange, isn’t it? If you could summon my Mazidfire, that would make you more powerful than them. You could do whatever you wanted to them.”
“Then why would they trust me with the power to control you?”
“All threads draw back to a black tattered robe.”
“Elrahet?”
“Indeed. The mystery of you is circumscribed by the mystery of Elrahet. I watched her as we walked—she is no ordinary witch, too strong for her age. In all matters of Mazid and Minder, Ayram defers to her.”
“You know, she’s not the only witch I’ve seen.”
“She isn’t?” Obo asked. His silver eyes widened in curiosity.
Mandri leaned towards Obo, and he lowered his voice so that it would not carry. The whipping wind outside did well to hide his whispered words.
“Before I was killed, I was visited by a witch just like Elrahet, only taller. And you know that golden knife Elrahet has?”
Obo nodded.
“Well, that witch had one just like it. Exactly the same. They could be sisters. Except this witch wanted me to serve the Amalgamete, not kill it. And there was no question about her being evil. She ripped out my ox’s stomach, then swallowed its Spark.”
Obo’s eyes turned to the floor as he worked to fit this new information into a picture which made sense. Mandri was content to let Obo do the puzzling for them both. Eventually, Obo’s floating head broke into a big, stupid smile.
“What is it?” Mandri whispered with excitement.
“Is this what friendship feels like?”
Mandri drew back and soured. “You don’t say something like that out loud. You just feel it. Dwell in it.”
“I’m sorry, I haven’t done this before.”
“I can tell.”
“It’s somehow intoxicating.”
“Stop talking about it. When you talk about it, you make it boring.”
“It’s not boring to me.”
“Look, when people start talking about their emotions and stuff, I have this physical reaction to it, and it’s annoying, so stop.”
“What kind of physical reaction?”
“My legs get hot.”
“Your legs get hot?”
“That’s what I said. Now shut up about it and figure out what is going on.”
Mandri stood up and fashioned some pillows out of what packs had been left in the room. He gave a quick look for Seb’s pack, because a drop of God’s Eye would significantly improve the moment, but Seb had expected this and had taken her pack with her. Mandri was forced, against his will, to lay there sober and watch the hole in the ceiling as the storm’s rage continued to build.
Hand after hand passed like this, and all the while the winds outside were rising. His thoughts turned to children’s stories, the ones that warned about the Ugmukheen. These stories came with instructions—hide the women, for as it passes it may fill their wombs. Beware the cough that can kill as vast quantities of sand are unavoidably inhaled. Store water, for it will strip the air of moisture, and its heat will sear the lungs. Mandri felt all these things coming on, except of course, the pregnancy part. But one thing he hadn’t seen was the snap and crackle of lightning leaping from every surface. The stories were clear on that—the air should come alive with little lightnings. 
The heat soon increased until the air was as hot as an oven. Mandri moved to flap his arms to air out his sweaty pits, and the motion conjured up a shocking spark.
He yelped in surprise.
“Your hair looks ridiculous,” said Obo.
Mandri reached up in the dark, and half the hairs on his head were standing on end. His excitement at this electric thrill was tempered by the sound of rock sliding atop rock.
It was coming from the temple above.
“The wind is lifting the dome,” said Obo, with a hint of worry.
“Should we be in here?”
“I would say that we should be fine, but, you never know.”
Mandri repositioned his makeshift cot as far away from the hole as the room allowed, shocking himself several times in the process. Before he was finished, an especially loud howl of wind kicked a gout of sizzling sand into the temple above, and it was followed by a splitting shock of thunder.

CRACKABOOOM

All Mandri saw was a flash of white light and then, suddenly, blackness, for the temple above caved in on itself, and the circle in the ceiling disappeared.
Mandri  shuffled back and felt for the wall. He could hear a torrent of sand pouring down into the room, and soon he felt it licking at his toes. The fear of being buried alive stunned him, but the flood of sand stopped as the hole above was plugged by a glut of the temple’s bricks.
“Well...that’s not good,” he said as one last wisp of sand drifted down—the sad, dying breath of another Old Jandri relic. </Text>

            <Title>The Tib</Title>
            <Text>They came at last to a moundless plain covered in a sticky bush called, unsurprisingly, stick bush. This plain led to the Tib desert, also called the Black Road, and the Tib was one of the Sand’s Eight Portions all unto itself. It was a flat, empty, expanse with a hard floor of small stones tarred in black rock-varnish. These stones were inset into the earth, as tightly interlocked as any Hrkan mosaic.  
Before they crossed into the Tib, Ayram had them all pick as many stick bushes as they could carry. Mandri was told it was for wood to make fire. Everyone picked ridiculous amounts and tied them onto their packs. Obo was practically buried in them. They looked like a family of giant hedgehogs. No one joked about it, as the mood was getting bleak because everyone, even Ayram, was tiring. Mandri felt remarkably lively. He tried to hide the fact that he’d found his desert legs, lest someone decide they wanted to unload some of their burdens onto him.
The first hand of the Tib was wonderful, for the flat and solid ground was a welcome change. Every hand after was a terror. The afternoon sun was killing them. The rocks underfoot were hot enough to blister bare skin, even if all a toe did was slip onto them for a moment, and after a day of walking,  they had to check their shoe-soles for budding holes that needed to be repaired because the ground could burn right through it.
More than any other part of the desert, the Tib was endless. They walked it, heading south and east, and after two days nothing changed. It was always the same endless black plain and empty sky. 
They tried to sleep two hands every night because they were simply too exhausted to walk right through it. And they had to sleep huddled around twiggy fires made from their stick bushes. It wasn’t the heat that provided comfort, though the nights were cold, it was the smell, for suspended above these miniature fires were tin bowls filled with a scented wax, smelling of carrion. In the mornings, the hardened wax would be thick with the fuzzy brown bodies of cusiloe flies, who’d been looking for meat in which to implant their eggs.
The flies live just under the Tib's skin, squeezed deep into the crevices of the interlocking rocks, and the odors of flesh, living or otherwise, drew them from hibernation—but only at night. Like reasonable creatures, they wouldn’t come out to bake in the sun. As soon as the red lip of the sun peeks up in the east, everyone rose and checked themselves to make sure they hadn’t been impregnated. If a fly did get under the skin, and the eggs were allowed to hatch, removing them would be a painful ordeal. Seb described the larvae—pulsing white thumbs with two fangs the length of fingernails. Pull them out and they can rip the flesh and leave a hole that will get infected. You look for them by feeling. Skin is too dark to see these soft little welts, especially Moto and Moteah's skin, so they had to feel around for a hardened, coin-sized bump, like a callous on the palm, but maybe it’s on the thigh, on the prick, in your armpit, upon your back, and since no one can reach the back, they’ve got to have someone else do it.
Moteah and Moto checked each other. Ayram and Elrahet checked each other. Mandri smiled at Purl but this was not reciprocated. He was paired with Seb. Neither were happy about the arrangement. Mandri complained about Seb’s borcandi stained fingers. Seb was worried, perhaps rightly so, that Mandri might miss a spot. 
Nobody checked Obo. He said the flies wouldn’t bother him. If they did, he would know.
Before setting off, they’d scrape the paste of dead flies from the surface of the wax and save them for food. Then they’d be on their way again, a short sprint in the half-light hours before the sun became unbearable, and when that happened, they’d stop, pitch little shelters, and rest until the worst of the heat had passed.
It was a lurching way to travel, and it felt to Mandri that they made no progress. Two more days passed and still the scenery did not change. To the north, a flat plain of pebbles for as far as the eye could see. To the south, a flat plain of pebbles for as far as the eye could see. To the east and to the west it was the same—flat for as far as the eye could see. For all he knew they were going in a circle. He began to study the chaotic patterns in the cracks on the floor. Once or twice he saw a jagged triangle that he’d swore he saw the day before.
Moving like this, out of rhythm and in unfamiliar hours, skating on the surface of an endless black stone sea, it changed the perception of time. There were no new spikes of memory around which a moment could congeal. No new sounds, and no new conversations because the heat of the day and the cold of night tempered everyone into the same person— short responses, shrugging shoulders, faces set in the same tight-lipped frown that said, “I just want to get through it”. And that’s who everyone was, bundled, muddled balls of just-get-through-it.
Except for Obo, of course. Obo remained genial and solicitous. Everyone hated him.</Text>

            <Title>King Sixa's Column</Title>
            <Text>One afternoon they stumbled upon a smooth black column sticking up out of the sand—plain granite, not Fabled Black
You should read it,” said Seb. “It’s gotta sign on the bottom. Funniest shit I ever heard.”
Mandri wandered around the column’s base, while the Ayramun lounged for a while in the column’s long shadow. Since Mandri couldn’t read Old Jandri, he had to turn around and let Obo translate the words graven into a stone plaque.
“The first bit is too scuffed to read,” said Obo, “But the rest says, ‘Things are said of her Kings that are shameful to relate, in particular regarding Sixa the Very Great, the first King whose seat was in Duur. The falseness of those infamous lies can begin to be suspected by noticing that, with refined cunning, they all make reference to alleged incidents that in themselves are unverifiable. Let it hereby be declared and known—Sixa the Very Great never had relations with a cow.”
“They made this whole column to announce this?”
“‘Moreover, King Sixa’s son, King Shura the Extremely Great, who didn’t permit even as Prince that in the temples his errors and sins could be concealed—never hid his true sins and defects. Whoever wishes to know them has only to read his ten-thousandth Kingly Decree or hear his heavenly vision from the good harvest of 1021. In none of these is it revealed that he is the result of mixed breeding.”
“You’re making that up.”
Elrahet was sitting on the column's plinth nearby, and she answered for Obo. “This column wasn’t put up by Shura, it was put up just to make fun of Shura.”
“But why put it in the middle of nowhere?”
“This isn’t the middle of nowhere,” said Elrahet. “This desert was once the womb of cities.” She gestured broadly out at the Sand with her cane. The landscape was raw and subtly colored by a host of stubby, gray-green pencil weeds and crawling bushes. In the distant south was a line of dune-brinks, topped with smoky spindrifts, and in the distant north, flying high, was a flock of wheeling, screaming blackbirds fighting over the scraps of some unseen corpse. There were no cities in it, nor even the ruins of one. 
“Each mound of dirt you see was once a city.”
Every quadrant of the horizon was studded by at least four or five humongous mounds which Mandri had taken to be the natural work of the earth. They were even standing on a mound. The thought that what was under his feet was a city was laughable.
She said, “They aren’t Hrkan cities, mind, these cities here were small and made of clay. Houses of unbaked brick, plastered with clay. Thatched roofs covered with clay. Each year, a fresh coat of clay. The rains come and the clay washes down from the walls and roofs and into the street, so the city grows up and up and up.” She stabbed the mound with her stick. “That’s how it all started.”
From then on, Mandri never called the Sand empty. It was as empty as a graveyard, which is to say, not empty at all.</Text>

            <Title>Minting Rock</Title>
            <Text>Before the rise of the Hrks, the Watered Portion was ruled by an Old Jandri king named Duror. To prove his dominion, Duror placed interlocking blocks of granite two-by-two-by-ten at every bend of the Jek river. Out of these gray columns he carved his long-bearded, long-robed image. The first statue was built at the Jek’s source, high up in the Goree mountains overlooking the Shoglok falls. This statue is now sanded so smooth by the erosion of ages that no discernible feature of Duror remains. He is little more than a gray wither of stone in the general shape of a man, earless and eyeless, brooding as the sun and moon and stars spun endlessly overhead.
The Jek river descends down into the foothills where it is guarded by a spate of statued Durors that have also been sanded into smooth, pointed pillars—more like cattle scratch posts than a filigreed statue of a king. Their heads are reduced to conical nubs, their swords worn down to the hilt. The river then pours out of the foothills and down into the brink of Hrkan civilization. These Durors were somewhat shielded from the erosive wind, but they were not able to hide from the chisels of recriminate outland men. Further down the river and into the long and winding plain, Duror’s component blocks begin to disappear altogether, for the stones are stolen to reinforce pastoral walls. Then, further on, the river arrives at the outskirts of Jeket. All that is left of Duror’s monuments are the enormous plinths upon which they once stood, for they are too large for herdsmen to bother with.
Old Jandri statues are disintegrating the nearer they come to Jeket—there is a symbolism here, obvious, unsubtle, and pointed, and so of course people disagree about what it means. A Hrkan Lord would say that it is a sign of Hrk’s cleansing influence on the old world, while an outland poke thinks its a sign of Hrk’s corrupting influence. Outland folk yearn for that storied age when all peoples were rootless, when herds of oxen were free to be chased across the entire continent, when women wove blankets so long they could be wrapped around a village, when men were honest and would cut off their own fingers to prove that they were sorry.
Both sides, Hrkan and Outland, claim the statues of Duror as symbols of their own magnificence. Sometimes they kill over them. Mandrameen thought this was all a bunch of nonsense, and everyone involved was an idiot. The pivotal detail that no one cared to notice was that most of these statues were sitting alone out in an empty desert because the course of the river Jek had changed dramatically. The statues have nothing to do with Hrk and whether it was good or bad. Their message is that nothing lasts forever, and while Mandri was sure about everything, he was most sure about that.
Rivers change their course.
Rivers dry up.
Continents dry up.
Solraheen Himself was buried. 
Everything living dies.
Beauty fades.
Paintings brown up and curl.
Statues turn to dust.
Everything living dies—that’s worth mentioning twice.
Ideas are easy to kill—some might try and argue that one, but Mandri could easily slip into saying that ideas are easy to corrupt, and no one could argue that.
Innocence is famously easy to kill. In fact, it seems that the main function of innocence is to be killed.
Manhood is easy to kill because it doesn’t exist in the first place. Same with womanhood, adulthood, and any-hood. They’re all hoods foisted upon a child who never quite grows up. And children? Schisol knows children are easy to kill.
Minting Rock was another object to add to this collection of things consigned to oblivion. Its central sunlit well was drilled straight through the rock’s core and down a long ways into the earth. When Mandri looked up and saw a canted column of light shining down into the blackness of Minting Rock’s hollowed out interior, he was smitten with that daunting awe which only comes from contact with a soon-to-be-extinguished culture.
But it was impressive. He felt, without exaggeration, that he was standing inside a broken bead cast off from the necklace of some primordial mountain god. 
He grabbed the rope which hung down into the dark, and out of sight an Ayramun began to pull him up.
The first level of Minting Rock was a bulbous, cylindrical cocoon eight men tall. The sunlight above didn’t quite reach this room, so the scant light splayed throughout came from two flower-flame oil lamps affixed to either shoulder of a dark and narrow passage to Mandri’s left. With so little light, much of the room’s detail was lost to blackness, but what Mandri could see of it took his breath away.
The flat disc of a floor was embossed with a rotationally symmetric diamond pattern, and at the floor’s edges this pattern ran smoothly up onto the wall, flowing upwards and splitting into several ribbons of sculptural stone, a weave that criss-crossed in and out of itself, a stunning fantasy that coupled geometric intricacy with organic fluidity and pulse—all in stone. And it had dimension. The outer ribbon layers cast hard, shifting shadows on the ribbons underneath. It seemed as if the room were a cage keeping out a kaleidoscopic vision stolen from a burgeon binge and then brought to life. The topmost layer, the bars of this cage, graduated from a swirl of ribbon into into a prickling fence of barbed thorns, and like a climbing vine they spiraled all the way up the wall and converged towards the center of the ceiling, merging into the lashes of an oval eye whose iris was the open shaft which led ever upwards and into the light of day.
The room smelled like a urinal. An unseen hand grabbed a fistful of Mandri’s robe between his shoulder blades and yanked him off the rope. He was then plopped ass-first onto the richly patterned floor and the pain in his thigh reasserted itself.
The man who’d pulled him out was Seb, and the smell was coming from him.
“What is this place?” Mandri asked in whispered wonder.
“This be Minting Rock,” Seb said as his near-toothless mouth squelched a borcandi spine. He was obviously an old hand at borcandi biting because he carried himself with that borcandi bent—like his muscles were stuck in tension and had been that way for years, shoulders hunched and tight, head knocked forward, limbs all slightly bowed as if he’d half-coiled up in fright and rusted that way. 
“I don’t care about the name,” Mandri said. “What is this place? Who made it?”
Seb nudged Mandri’s hip with the toe of his shoe, and then he shooed Mandri up against the wall with a few flaps of his fingers.
“Keep out of the way,” he said.
Mandri scooted backwards against the wall and shoved his injured leg flush against it, so that nothing of him stuck out into the floor. 
The neck of Seb’s robe was yawning at Mandri’s nose, and the man’s odor was pouring out—he smelled like butter gone bad. He peered into Mandri’s eyes and said, “I can tell you a burgeon biter, ain’t ya?”
The man’s odor was nauseating. Mandri scrunched up his nose and simply replied, “You smell.”
Seb stood back up, then wilted. Even a hard-up outland man couldn’t abide being found out like that. A man’s face could be ugly as mud, that was the world’s fault—but his smell, his smell was coming from the inside and it said something about him without his meaning to. A bad smell is the one thing that could make the most loutish street-junk keeper feel shame. A bad smell is a secret every man’s got to keep.
“What’d I tell you about flappin’ them lips?”
Seb’s tired eyes managed to impress upon Mandri a great disappointment. Seb was a nobody amongst nobodies, as irrelevant as one of Jeket’s crawlers—men who beg from beggars. Mandri had a sense for these people even if they hadn’t yet fallen that far. There’s a dopiness about them, the face kind of sags. And they smell. To a man and woman, they smell.
Suddenly, a shrill whistle rang out from the oculus above. A heartbeat later, and Minting Rock was alive with the slapping patter of leatherbound feet. Muffled shouts reared out of unseen corridors. It was as if Minting Rock’s door had just been knocked and all the house mutts were flung into a muster. Hill came climbing up the well-shaft rope, his stout frame slinking up and up like a fat caterpillar, and without so much as a nod he disappeared into the chamber above.
There came, springing out of the passage to Mandri’s left, a clink of metal on stone. This thumping clink repeated again and again, in time with a walking stride, growing louder as it neared Mandri’s chamber. Mandri found himself trembling, and he was scooting away when Ayram stormed into the room, beard-jutting and wild-eyed. In his hand was his long iron spear, which barely cleared the passage ceiling. Its chisel end bit into the polished floor.
Moto followed him, and waddling in behind Moto was the short, old, black-ragged witch woman named Elrahet. She lingered in the passage mouth, under the flickering lamps, and her dark hood cast a long, hard shadow which hid her eyes from view. Mandri watched her as she watched Ayram. There was a familiarity to her profile that he couldn’t quite place.
She turned her whole hooded head towards Mandri, and his eyes fled in embarrassment. Though it was a mere glancing exchange her gaze stirred up his stomach. 
Ayram and Moto were standing in the opposite end of the room. Between them was a shadowy lump. Moto kicked it, and a dull crack sounded out. Moto steadied himself against the wall and was about to deliver another rough kick when Elrahet told him to stop.
“The Mazid is awake,” she said as if pressed for time.
Moto stepped back to let the light in, and there was Obo with his eyes open, blinking at the world around him like he’d just woken up into a dream.
Ayram had no sympathy.
“Tell me how you did it,” he growled.
Obo looked up at Ayram and regarded the giant with contempt. He said, voice hoarse, “What are you blaming me for now?”
Ayram did not reply. He didn’t need to. A man his size could simply stand still and glare, and that was intimidating enough to scare a reluctant tree into shaking off its fruit.
Obo pushed himself up into a sitting position, and his head drooped as if his neck were so weak it couldn’t bear the burden. Mandri thought Obo was playing too hard for sympathy here.
Obo said, “I know it can be difficult, sometimes, to draw a clear line between cause and effect, but blaming me for anything seems unsound.”
Ayram lifted his great spear and then let it slip down his fist and its wide chisel tip hit the stone floor right next to Obo’s hip.
Obo was unimpressed. “You’re the one that captured me and brought me here,” he said. “If I’ve caused you any trouble, then you’ve brought it upon yourself.”
Ayram remained silent. Mandri suspected the man was in the middle of realizing that Obo was incapable of feeling fear.
Obo said, “If I may take a moment to ask—what is it you plan to do with me? I’m a curious creature, I have to know.”
With a twist of his wrist, Ayram set the iron spike to rest against Obo’s collar bone. The weight of it almost tipped Obo over. Obo shrugged it off, and Ayram set it right back on the bone. 
Obo said, “Did you honestly believe that a Hrkan Lord would make a weapon as powerful as me without devising a way to track me down should I get loose?”
Moto blurted out, “They can track you down to anywhere?”
“Have you truly never heard of the Mazidariga?”
Mandri had never heard of the Mazidariga. Judging by the dumbfounded expression in Moto’s eyes, and the shrug in Ayram’s shoulders, neither man had heard of it either. Since none of them were willing to admit to not knowing something, an uneasy silence went unbroken until Elrahet grumbled aloud, “Riga means shadow.”
Moto bent down and began to examine Obo’s shadow for a sign of some obscure magic.
“Not my literal shadow,” Obo said with insulting disdain. “A Mazid’s shadow is a creature. They are grown alongside the Mazidai—their purpose is to hunt us down. You cannot hope to hide from the Hrks so long as you hold onto me.”
“Moto,” said Ayram.
“Yes?”
“Get the boys blooded up.”
“You’re going to fight them?” Obo asked in disbelief. “That’s very brave. I hope you don’t expect I’ll be much help.”
“Why not?”
“A Mazidariga can ensnare my psuedospark from afar.”
Neither man paid him any heed. Moto jumped onto the well-shaft rope and climbed out of sight, whilst Ayram turned to Seb, and Seb, anticipating a word from his leader, stepped forward.
Ayram said, “Take the boy and the Mazid up into an aspect.”
Seb bowed in deference as Ayram and Elrahet swept out of the chamber, back into the passage from whence they came. Ayram’s iron staff clinked against the stone as he went, though the sound was soon lost amongst the yip and din of a band of the hardest pokes preparing for battle.
Seb grabbed Mandri’s wrist and yanked him to his feet, and Mandri groaned as his leg screamed in pain. Seb then hurried over to Obo and made a fuss about wrapping up Obo’s wounds so that Mazid’s blood wouldn’t taint his person. Once Obo was swaddled up tight like a baby, arms tucked inside, Seb picked him up and carried him under-arm like a freshly-wrapped package of beef. He ran into the dark passage. Then he popped back out and motioned for Mandri to follow.
Mandri found it hard to follow Seb through the narrow, winding ways of Minting Rock. He limped along fiercely, steadying himself against the sculptured stone, but he couldn’t keep up.
“Hurry up!” Seb cried as he doubled back and took a hold of Mandri’s wrist. He pulled Mandri towards a sputtering lamp whose light flooded up a chubby set of curling stairs. Ascending these put an odd twist in Mandri’s mental map of the place, and it became difficult to maintain a sense of where he was within the rock. There was almost no light, and he was shoved through so many warped passages that all he knew for certain was that he was moving away from the center. Every new chamber and corridor became more cluttered and cramped, and the stonework less polished and more rough—the walls were still sculpted into an otherworldly weave but Mandri’s fingers could feel an inattention to thickness of edge. It was clumsy work, clumsy in comparison to what he’d seen in that central shaft. 
Mandri got to thinking, after bumping his head on an absurdly low door frame, that whoever had carved this rock had perhaps carved out too much of it. Unless Old Jandri tribesmen were as learned as Hrkan architects in the art of stressing stone, the whole thing was bound to fall apart. And the further out Mandri went, the more slapdash the passages and rooms became. By the time he saw a slit of blue sky though an embrasure, his toes and fingers were stumbling upon stress cracks in the floors and walls. Once, in this dusty dark, he bumped his shoulder against an unworked wooden beam that arched over his head. He swore he saw the floor above buckle and sag.
He was eventually pushed into a long and narrow room, long enough for him to lay down in, but barely enough room to turn around. This closet had access to outside air through a stippled pattern of finger-sized holes bored into the far wall. The sun didn’t shine directly through them, so these pinpricks of day sat on the black rock wall illuminating nothing, like a constellation of stars. They composed an Old Jandri pattern—a simple, eight-flamed sun, the traditional symbol of Solraheen.
Seb elbowed Mandri further into this shoulder-squeezing closet, and that’s when the room’s defining quality hit him—the air inside was thick with a foul smell, sweet and horrible, cloying, as if a mound of peaches had been left to putrefy in some dark corner. Mandri gagged, clutched at his nose, and when the spicy bitterness stung the back of his tongue like rancid burgeon bile he spat and choked.
He thought, at first, that this was some kind of prayer room and that the smell was incense put here to trigger his spiritual impulse. He didn’t entertain the thought that this scent was meant to mask a fouler smell until he reached out into the dark to steady himself, and instead of slapping against stone, his fingers sank into something that felt curiously like skin.
He yelped and recoiled.
He leaned back into the opposite wall where his other hand brushed up against a dried and bony limb.
He yelped again, and prayed fast that Solraheen would adjust his eyes to the darkness. He’d have pulled his own Spark out to see.
Seb slapped the back of his head. “Keep your hands to yourself.”
“What’s in here?”
“Don’t worry about it.”
Seb pushed Mandri towards the stipple-pricked sigil of Solraheen.
Mandri turned to protest his new accommodation.
“Sit down and be quiet,” Seb commanded.
Before Mandri could frame his dissent, a dark shape flew towards him and crashed into his stomach. He wheezed, went sprawling against the wall and sank down to the floor. He fumbled around in the dark and squealed in disgust when his thumb poked through a stiff and gristly cloth and dove into something with the consistency of fire-crusted jelly. 
It wasn’t until Obo’s airy laugh came giggling out from under Mandri’s armpit that Mandri realized what had just happened—Seb had thrown Obo at him, and he’d just plumbed his thumb into Obo’s stumped thigh.
“Get off me!” Mandri shrieked.
“I hardly can,” said Obo. “I’m wrapped up tight.”
Mandri gruffly picked Obo up. The Mazid was about as light as a two-year-old.
“Put me down.”
“Stop wiggling.”
“I’m not, you’re shaking me.”
“There’s nowhere to put you.”
“Quit your flappin’!” Seb shouted. “And stop touchin’ shit. This is a sacred place.”
Mandi didn’t want to get slapped so he shut up and stuffed Obo in between his good right leg and the wall. He had to bunch himself up closer to the other side and that was a dicey proposition, because something dead was resting there and he didn’t want his wound rubbing up against it. 
Mandri prayed for a light, and by Sol, there it was—a diffuse glow of lamp light came creeping up the blackrock corridor wall behind Seb. Seb spun around and there was the girl Purl, standing in the room’s entrance, looking as if she’d just picked herself up from rolling down a dune. Her robes were as dirty as a sandrat, and her hair was as wild as  a weedbush puffing out of the wide black bandanna that she’d affixed to her forehead. The red kell oil smeared on her face picked up the warm light and made it seem as if her cheeks were rubbed raw, down to the bleeding muscle.
Mandri recalled the sight of her screaming at Obo to kneel back in that pit cave a day or two before. She seemed much healthier.
She peered around Seb at Mandri, as if looking for him. 
“Move,” she said to Seb. Seb begrudgingly stepped out of the room to give her the space to enter. As she did, the oil-dish lamp she held before her splayed its light into the room’s interior, bringing this haunting ‘closet’ to life.
Cut into the black rock walls were coffin-sized slits, three on either side, stacked one above the other. Inside each of these, resting in peaceful repose, was a corpse, each in a different stage of decomposition, and each naked as it came from the womb, and all of them, as far as Mandri could tell, were giant men. Ayram-sized men. Their beards were black and gray.
The corpse that the light lit clearest was as black and shriveled as a grape weeks fallen from the vine. It was impossible to say for certain how long that body had been laying there, for an unbothered corpse in the Sand could last an age, but cloistered away in Minting Rock, sheltered from the wind and abrasion, Mandri figured that a corpse could last for as long as Solraheen willed it. That body could be as ancient as the world itself. It was disgusting.
A desiccated hand with purpled fingers.
Shadows licked at a dry, pruned up shoulder.
All of it frosted by a layer of dust.
No hint of bloat, no tar-like iridescence of fresh rot that might explain the smell.
Then Mandri looked down and saw the spreading rot in his own leg and he wondered if the smell was coming from him.
Purl set her lamp down in a shallow recess in the wall which had been carved for the purpose. With her other arm—her handless arm—she was clutching a smallgrass basket close to her chest, and this she set on the floor at Mandri’s feet. She squatted down and began to unload it—first out was a puffy square of gray wool folded into itself. Next was a bundle of damp leaves knotted at the stems. Then came a stone mortar which tinked against the floor. Last came three small alabastron jars that were packed to the brim with waxy substances, one red, one green, and one blue. Purl hesitated with these, treated them more gently than the rest, and once all were arrayed out before her, she handed the basket back to Seb, who tucked it mindlessly into one of the corpsedens, and left the room.
“Let me see the bite,” she said to Mandri.
Mandri drew up his robe and leaned onto his right ass cheek. He rolled his wounded thigh into the light. The poultice was wrinkled and sloppy, hanging half off. Purl eyed the dark veins in his leg with a keen interest.
“Would you look at that,” she muttered.
She pulled a thumb-sized pestle from her ruddy robes and she dolloped a two-finger-dip of each of the colorful waxes into her mortar. Purl’s one good hand wasn’t used to doing two things at the same time, so each time she clawed wax from a jar, the jar slid and teetered on its base, and each time she had to catch it, her handless left arm hanging in the air like a useless friend.
“How bad does it hurt?”
“About as bad as can be.”
Purl peeled back the old poultice from Mandri’s leg to reveal the black wound underneath. It was an awful sight, smothered over with that mucky paste.
“Your timing is lucky,” she said dryly. “One more night and it would be permanent.”
“What are you doing?”
Purl pushed Mandri back with a miffed look and then set herself to mixing the medicine in the mouth of her mortar. She poured a finger full of water from her personal waterskin into it, swirled it around with the wax, then she plucked three leaves and dropped them onto the swimming globs of color. Once this was done to satisfaction, she began to knead it all into a paste.
Mandri watched with eager intent, and so did Obo. Obo leaned over Mandri’s legs, trying to peer into the mixture, but since he was hardly more than a ribcage swiveling on hips, ‘leaning’ was a chancy thing. Mandri had to catch him to keep him from tipping over, and this commotion interrupted Purl’s pestle’s rhythmic thump. She paused and gave Obo the same miffed look she’d given Mandri a moment before.
Obo said, “I thought that wax was insoluble in water.”
“Must not be wax,” said Purl, and she resumed smashing the bits of leaves down into the sopping goop. By now the colors were beginning to mix, turning a greenish shade of brown that looked nearly black in the lamplight. Obo was polite enough to wait until she was finished to ask, “Would you mind if I tasted it?”
The disgust in Purl’s face was absolute, with thin lines wearing deep furrows in her forehead—this was a look she often wore. Most outland women end up with rumpled foreheads, and it’s not just from squinting at the sun. From first blood they’re fighting wars of aggravation against outland men. The difference here was that the nuisance at hand was a Mazid, not a man, and he wasn’t rebuffed in the usual way. His eyes were bright, expecting entertainment.
Purl grumbled and set again to her work. She unfolded the woolen square to make a pocket which she then packed full with the dark goo from her mortar. She scraped the bottom of the mortar to make sure she’d left no leavings. Obo interrupted her concentration by saying, “I’d like to introduce myself.”
Purl rolled her eyes and did not respond.
Mandri saw that Obo was about to make a mistake by pressing the girl, and he felt compelled to intervene.
He said, “Obo, stop.” 
Purl’s brow knit even tighter, “You call it Obo?” she asked.
“That’s his name.”
“You share names with a Mazid?”
“We’ve been talking.”
Purl cradled the poultice wrap with her good hand, then plopped it paste-down on the Mandri’s wound. A shock of pain ran through his hip and he almost bit through his tongue. Soon after a quick iciness flooded into the wound and chased the pain deep down to the bone. When the wincing excitement wore off, he was surprised to find that the pain was almost gone entirely. His leg was cold and numb.
“Oh,” he said, relief shaping his voice. “That was fast.”
Purl said, “What would you and a Mazid have to talk about?”
“We’ve been scheming an escape,” Mandri said, and he snuck a side-long smirk towards Obo. “That’s why he wants to introduce himself. He wants to figure out how he can use you. The more he knows about you, the better he can manipulate you. That’s what he’s been doing with me. He’s a schemer. Look at him.”
Both he and Purl looked at Obo.
“That is not true,” Obo said, eyes locked on Purl.
“He also told me he never lies, so you know that means he lies all the time.”
“That is not true either.”
“Obo, you’re not fooling anyone.”
Purl stood up in a huff and her eyes flicked to the ends of the unwrapped poultice. “Tie it up yourself,” she said, and she quickly gathered her ministrations and left in flurry.
Thankfully, she’d left her oil lamp.
“What did you do that!?” Obo exclaimed. His face was not well suited for anger. With hairless brows and lashless eyes, his face looked more like an underpainting for a face than a real one.
Mandri replied, “I was trying to earn her trust.”
“You would earn her trust by betraying mine?”
“That’s the idea.”
“You would prove yourself trustworthy by being untrustworthy?”
Mandri set about wrapping the ends of the poultice around his leg. “If we want her to tell us what is going on, then we’ve got to get her to lower her guard, and the best way to do that is to be honest. Honesty is disarming. You should try it sometime.”
“Honesty requires discretion, Mandri, otherwise it causes more problems than it solves.”
“I know what I’m doing.”
“Yet, she left the room.”
“Obo, she left because of you. She hates you. They all hate you. They’re not ever going to talk to you, and because of that, we’ve got to get them to talk to me, and to do that, they have to trust me. If that means they trust you less, so be it. What’s the harm?”
Obo’s mood softened a little. “I don’t blame you for not knowing this—it’s my fault for not telling you—but this girl reacts extremely negatively to anything that doesn’t reek of kindness.”
“What makes you say that?”
“Anything that’s harsh, or argumentative, or loud, puts her off. She removes herself from any perceived hostility.”
“How could you possibly know that?”
“That girl is my Minder.”
“So?”
“As we speak, her fingers are gripping my heart. She has bound me to her will, so I can feel hers. I’ve only had one other Minder’s will coursing through my veins, and he was as foul a man as ever lived, so believe me when I tell you that I know what a will without kindness feels like—Purl is different. I can feel her cringe at the mere thought of two people angling at each other.”
Mandri had a hard time processing all this. He couldn’t get past the image of a human hand squeezing the Mazid’s heart.
“Well…that’s interesting…but don’t expect any kindness from me, so we might as well write Purl off.”
“She is my Minder. I can’t very well ‘write off’ the person who holds my will hostage. We must indulge her kindness. I don’t see why this isn’t a positive thing. She could have been cruel.”
“Kindness doesn’t mean what you think it means.”
“Oh?”
“Think about it—on average, and this is true, on average, people are more likely to hate each other than love each other, aren’t they? So if kindness is how one person treats its own kind, then a kind person is a selfish, hostile person.”
“Mandri, it doesn’t matter what word we use to describe her. I think you’ve spent too much time biting burgeons.”
“You think I’m wrong?”
“I think you’re distracted. We’re far afield from the problem at hand.”
“What are you talking about, we’re right on point. If we want to get in with these Ayramun, we’ve got to agree on how to go about doing it. If you tell me to be kind to someone, I’m going to be kind, but I have a different—more correct—understanding of the word.”
Obo paused, stared straight ahead, listening for something which Mandri could not hear. He said, “Mandri, there is a column of Hrkan Skulsi marching towards this rock.”
“Oh,” Mandri muttered.
Obo nodded and said, “They’ll be here within a finger. When they get here, they’re going to slaughter us all.”
Obo’s gray eyes settled into an easy gleam as if he were almost happy about it. He then turned his sight towards the stippled sign of Solraheen, again listening. “Actually, they’re here already.”
His words heralded the deep and yawning howl of the Hrkan horn of war. 
BWEEEEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooommmm
The sound shook the wall against Mandri’s back while the rest of Minting Rock was sent stirring with the hollers of the Ayramun barking their excitement. Mandri, bewildered, stood up, pushing himself up against the narrow walls, doing so carefully to not bother his leg, all so that he could turn and look through one of the small holes in the eightfold sun. He couldn’t see much, but out there, sure enough, set against a field of fiery sand was a white-robed column of men.
“Well I think this proves my point,” he said. “People don’t march around like that to help out widows and orphans, do they? That, there, is the kindness of men in full regalia. I wonder whose kindness is stronger, those Hrks or these Ayramun.”
“Mandri, I can almost guarantee that you will be dead in less than half a hand.”
“The Ayramun can win, can’t they?”
“Seventeen Ayramun against eighty Skulsi is long odds.”
“Ayram’s got to count for at least twenty. And this rock is practically a fortress. It’s got murder holes. What are the Hrks going to do, lay siege? Out here in the desert?”
“I don’t know, but I’m sure they have a plan.”
“The Ayramun have got you.”
“No they don’t.”
“Oh come on, Obo. You know, I’ve never actually seen a Mazid spit Mazidfire.”
“And you likely never will.”
“So you’re going to sit there and let them come and kill me? I thought we were friends.”
“We are.”
“Obo, if you open your mouth and blast those Hrks to Shis, I will wash your feet with oil.”
“I don’t have any feet.”
“I’ll wash your nubs with the richest blueseed oil that I can find. I’ll make it myself.”
Obo sighed and shook his head. “I don’t have choice in the matter.”
Mandri was halfway through sighing his displeasure, when a shrill and steady whistle sounded out from the Hrkan column and pierced his thoughts, pushing out all other concerns. 
It was a metallic, tinny tone that quivered like a strandtail’s warble, only it was ten times louder and harsher than the shriek of a hawk. That damned sound cut through the rock so clearly that its source might as well have been in the room. For Mandri, it was an ear-splitting pain, but to Obo it was doing something stranger.
The Mazid had fallen over onto his side and was squirming. His eyes were rolling around in their sockets, twitching and turning as if a worm were chewing on his ocular nerve. The whistling jumped to a higher pitch and Obo’s whole body began to convulse in violent fits. Mandri reached out to keep Obo’s head from thumping against the stone, but before he could do anything to help, Obo’s stomach wretched, his chest heaved, and a dim gray formless ember shot out from his mouth, leaving his body limp and lifeless. The strange light hovered just above Obo’s lips for the briefest spell, and then the whistling shifted its register again, higher still into a pitch reserved for animal spirits, and the gray ember shot right towards Mandri’s head.
He ducked and the ember whizzed past his neck, its energy scorching his skin as it went. It zipped on to punch a hole the size of Mandri’s fist into the rock behind him. Mandri spun around in time to watch it fly up into the air. He lost sight of it for a moment against the bright midday sky, then found it again as it dove towards the distant column of Hrks. As it fell, the whistling fell to a drowning timbre, until, with a flash, the light and the whistling were snuffed out altogether, as if swallowed up by a figure at the head of the Hrkan column—a figure much shorter than the rest and robed in black.
Before Mandri’s ears could recover their tuning, the Hrkan horn of war sounded out again.
BWWWEEEEeeeeoooooooommmm.
The deep bellow shook Mandri out of his skin. He’d heard the horn once already, but this time—this time he knew the horn was blowing for him. Terror welled up in his gut. He could see the column clearly now through his punched out window, and as the Hrks marched they flattened out into a solid square. A command was barked and the soldiers quickened their advance, bracing their white, oblong shields up against the smattering of arrows that was sure to come.
Twenty paces later, and Mandri heard the twang of bows and fluttering phhht of arrow fletchings brushing through the air, rushing high up into the sky. Ten Hrkan paces later, and a flock of black arrows fell upon the hide of that onrushing Hrkan square. Most of these missiles bounced harmlessly away, but some snuck in between the scales, marked here and there by the sudden tumbling of one of the Hrkan number, each followed by a chorus of triumphant hollers as several Ayramun took credit all at once.
These little victories did nothing to slow the Hrkan advance. Every gap opened by the felling of one soldier was closed in quick-step time, and when, at last, it was clear that they would not scatter and flee, the hollering of the Ayramun twisted into stressed appeals for Solraheen’s intervention. Mandri could hear the more practical Ayramun sprinting from room to room, trying to find better angled holes to fire upon their target, sometimes crashing into each other, screaming insults as whole bundles of arrows were split.
Seb rushed by Mandri’s hole, then came back, noticing the fresh new vantage in the wall.
“Move out of the way!” he shouted as ran in. He kicked Obo’s lifeless body to the side, then squatted down and started firing arrows down at the marching men. They were close enough now that their faces could be seen peering over their shields.
Seb fired his arrows with ruthless efficiency, but judging by the stream of curses that followed every shot, he was missing his mark. After each twang of his bow, his shooting angle shifted steeper and steeper to match the Hrkan advance, until at last the white-cloaked Hrks tucked themselves up under Minting Rock’s bulging belly. Seb he grabbed his bow in both hands and snapped it on his knee, then pulled his dagger and fled from the room.
Then Mandri heard a noise which froze his body solid.

Chink-TINK.

“What was that?” Mandri wondered aloud.

Chink-TINK.

It sounded like a chisel.
He looked again through the hole in the wall and tried to make sense of the situation. Directly below was a bevy of upturned shields, in the center of each, the gold-eyed Hrkan sun was looking up at him with dumb indifference.
TINK-TINK-TINK
The chiseling was getting louder, faster, followed close behind by the roars of Hrkan men possessed by the spirit of battle. Somewhere far below, in Minting Rock’s entrance well, limbs were getting hacked to pieces.
Then came a loud stone-splitting crack and the whole of Minting Rock lurched. 
Mandri stumbled but caught himself as the sound of crunching rock ran through the floor and ceiling.
#
CRRRCKKKKkkkk-krrrk-kkkkkk-k

All went silent in the wake of this rock-hewn thunder.
There were no shouts of struggle below.
No clash of sword on shield.
For a brief, glorious moment, every Spark from man to flea dropped their troubles and shared the exact same fearish feeling, and this communion might have lasted forever if it weren’t split by the tinny sound of a chisel striking stone.

TINK

A long, jagged crack exploded into the floor of Mandri’s burial chamber and he jumped as Minting Rock lurched again. The dust of ages shook loose from the ceiling, as if the room above had been hammered by Solraheen’s fist.
“Obo,” Mandri said to the glassy-eyed and lifeless Mazid. “Obo, we’d better leave.”
Another jolt shook the room, and the crack in the floor opened wider. Mandri shuffled away just as a thunderous boom sent the crack darting across the whole length of the floor and up the sun-stippled wall, fracturing the chamber in two. Then suddenly the chamber’s whole left side slid down an inch before coming to a rest on some new fault in the foundation far below.
Mandri, fear pulsing in chest, yanked one of the aged corpses out of its resting place and tossed it onto the ground. He then grabbed Obo’s limp body and threw the Mazid into the now unoccupied grave. He pushed Obo as far towards the back as he could, and then Mandri crawled in alongside him. The very moment that Mandri tucked in his legs, the opposite wall started to collapse.
The first thing to go was Purl’s clay oil lamp. It jostled loose from its perch and smashed onto the floor, splashing licks of oil and flame about the room. Then the wall behind it shook, and the seams in the ceiling burst, shooting a jet of smoke into the room, flooding Mandri’s grave with dust, obscuring the air so completely that Mandri could not see the hail of stone come crashing down. What he did see, a moment later, after wiping the dust from his eyes, was the awesome sight of Minting Rock split in half like a geode.
Before he could even register his shock, the opposite half began to fall away. 
Haunting screams split the air as those Ayramun stuck on the wrong side of this split-open stone grasped their impending doom. Three men, on the floor above Mandri, jumped across to Mandri’s side, but below, a ragged, fear-stricken woman straddled the half-shorn wall of what once was a tunnel. Mandri watched in terror as she rode the undone structure down into a billowing cloud of dust, crying a prayer up to Solraheen as she went.
Mandri closed his eyes against the deafening crash.
“Solraheen, my god,” Mandri prayed. It was the start of a daily prayer, but the rest of the words, Mandri had long forgotten.
He opened his eyes again, and peered down at the chaos from his blessed perch. The floor was completely gone, and in its place was a hundred foot drop down into a swirl of rust-colored smoke.
Then, as the smoke lifted—
A swarm of white Hrkan cloaks far below, some moving amongst the crumble of black rock, some deathly still.
Then some of the black rocks moved, some jumped out of the structure still left standing—Ayramun in their dark, dusty rags.
A yell rang out and the two sides rushed each other. Once again, the battle was joined.
Mandri crept back into his hole—there was no clear way to get down, not that he wanted to get down. He was oddly happy to be stuck up in his high hole. No matter who won down below, he’d be safe.

TINK
TINK
TINK

Whatever demon had split open Minting Rock was not finished, and this time Mandri could feel the chisel strokes resonate all through the rock around him. He curled up in that grave, wrapped his head in his hands and tried to shut out the horror of it, but his sense of equilibrium remained, and it screamed bloody murder as his half of Minting Rock began to tilt.
At first it was only a slight shifting as the rock swayed away from the melee down below. Then a loud clap of snapping stone sounded out, and Mandri’s perch swayed precariously back the opposite direction. He scrambled to grab hold of something, to stop himself from spilling out of his hole and into the open air, and just as his hip began to slide, a thunder of faulting joints burst up from below, and a puff of smoke shot up behind it. The whole terrifying thing swayed back away yet again, before settling into an unstable, precipitous tilt. What was left of Minting Rock dithered there, letting the dread get nice and settled in Mandri’s belly, until, at last, there came a shattering CRACK, and the structure began to fall. Mandri braced himself in that half-shorn tomb as the horizon fell out of the sky.
The whole structure rolled onto its back like a freshly halved melon. Mandri could do nothing but look to the sky and feel helpless. If there were clouds they would have been zipping by, but there was only the atmosphere, that gradient of blue shifting into a deeper blue, and for the first time ever, Mandri noticed that the desert sky is a bluer blue than any other. He didn’t have time to wonder why that was, for amid the rush and tumble, his sight was swallowed up by a cloud of black-red dust and a suffocating blur of sand and stone. Before Mandri could fully realize the horror of being buried alive, the rock grave cradling him snapped open, and the rock bottom sprung loose like a tensioned lever, catapulting him into the air. 
Mandri flew a few yards above the surface of the earth. Such was his speed that he smashed right through the brambles of a karkle bush before tumbling into a ragdoll skip along the surface of the warm red-orange sand.
When he finally came to a stop, he found himself half buried in a fledgling dune.
And he was alive.
He pulled himself free from the sand, spit some of it out of his mouth, coughed a bit of dust out of his lungs, then rubbed his eyes open, surprised to see that his scrawny self was still well-put-together. The shoulder which had borne the brunt of impact wasn’t even scratched. There weren’t any bones sticking out, at least. And while the demon bite on his leg was still smarting, Purl’s poultice was still knotted tight. Everything else was where it was supposed to be. The only thing that truly hurt was the left side of his face, which had bit the sand when he landed. Still, that was nothing. Considering everything, that was nothing. He’d been tossed almost fifty yards and was no worse for wear. Meanwhile, what was left of Minting Rock had collapsed into a heap of rubble.
It was a miracle. 
It was a miracle coming after a string of miracles. By rights he should be dead—dead three times over. In Meskalim, Salavan had choked to death, and he’d come back from that. He’d been chewed up by a demon, and just happened to be traveling with a woman who knew how to cure it. And now he’d survived a fall from a height that should have squashed him flat.
Here he was, alive and breathing.
“Wild,” Mandri mused.
He looked up at the bright blue sky and blinked at the sun, and he felt, in that blessed moment, that he was staring into the eye of Solraheen Himself. Perhaps this rapture would have drawn out a word of praise, and he might have converted then and there to the most devout of all possible men, but it was not to be, for a Hrkan Skulsi was creeping up behind him.
“Die, you rangy lizard!”
Mandri turned and saw a mustachioed man in a sparkling white robe running at him with his blade drawn high. Despite the look of fury and rage twisting this soldier’s face, Mandri wasn’t frightened. Actually, he felt a confidence brewing. If he was supposed to be dead three times over, then what was a fourth?
He held up his hands and shouted, “I surrender!”
The soldier stopped his sprint and seemed pleased to hear it. A proud curve swelled in his chest, and he stomped over to where Mandri knelt. 
“My luck I should catch a coward,” he said. He held his shining iron sword towards Mandri’s neck and beckoned with its tip for Mandri to stand up.
Mandri stood up.
“Walk,” said the soldier, and he pointed with his sword in the desired direction, towards a detachment of white cloaked soldiers standing some thirty yards away from the cloud of Minting Rock’s still seething rubble. These Hrks stood shoulder to shoulder, watching the death of Minting Rock as if it were something they’d seen ten times before, and perhaps they had. They were big, bearded men, veterans of many battles.
Mandri winced as his captor’s sword prodded the small of his back, and he began to walk towards the Hrkan line. And as the squealing stone of Minting Rock settled into it’s final resting place, the air came alive again with the clamor of battle—breathless shouts of fury, metal clanging against metal, a staccato burst of excited yips, punctuated here and there by cries of agony.
The first actual figure to pop out of that lifting smoke was Moto. The Zosan was crouching atop a tall, slanted chunk of former floor, and with one hand he steadied himself, and with his sword he deftly waved off three Hrkan blades swiping at his ankles. Then Purl came scrambling out from a hole in the nearby rubble and disappeared further into the swirling cloud of dust. Two Hrkan cloaks chased after her, but both came to a sudden, fluttering stop after something swung out of the dust and slammed into their chests—a bone-crunching WHUMP. The two men collapsed to the ground, and standing over them was Ayram.
The giant was so caked in dust that he looked like a creature borne from the Sand. The upper part of his black robe was hanging in tatters over his waistband like it were half-molted skin, and his long black hair, freed from his headwrap, was sweeping his shoulders clean as he twirled his long, blackened iron spear like it were a reed. He slammed it down and smashed its knobby end right through the skull of one of the fallen Hrks.
The blood-crunch was so loud that Mandri almost tripped. The three Hrkan men who’d been bothering Moto turned towards the giant and screamed curses at the man who’d slain their comrade with such brutal indifference. Ayram charged them, swung his spear in a swooping arc, and that famed Skulsi discipline went to Shis as the iron crunched through the first Hrk’s shield. In a blur, the chisel-head swung round and sliced right through the face of another. The final hapless soldier charged and stabbed, but such was Ayram’s speed that his iron spear was around again in time to brush the sword right out of Skulsi’s hand. 
The man backed away in fright. He picked up a rock and threw it at Ayram’s head, and before Mandri could see how Ayram dealt with it, he felt another sharp prodding in his back.
“Get a move on!” The soldier behind him shouted. The man was unconcerned about his comrade’s plight. He was more interested in getting Mandri to the Hrkan line. So impatient was he, that he took Mandri by the wrist, upped the pace to a jog, and yanked a howling Mandri along behind, for though Purl’s poultice was a soothing balm, Mandri’s demon-bitten leg wasn’t capable of handling a run.
After much fumbling and stumbling, they reached the Hrkan detachment and Mandri was thrown down to the sand. His captor then set the cold edge of his blade on the back of Mandri’s neck to keep his head bowed in deference. The man then pounded his chest twice—the standard Hrkan salute—and with the snap of a well-drilled soldier he declared, “My sirs, I’ve found another skulking bandit.”
Mandri overcame the fear of the blade pressing against his neck to peep at the ‘sirs’ this soldier was referring to, and he was stunned to see that standing in front of him was a boy robed in black. Mandri stole a second glance and realized that it was not a boy, but a creature, one crafted by the Hrks—white and hairless as Obo and so short that Mandri, kneeling, met him eye to bloodshot eye. Shielding this creature’s nose and mouth was a smooth iron plate riveted onto a leather band that was strapped tight around its head. It was a strange sort of muzzle, with only a small beveled hole for sipping air, and, Mandri presumed, for whistling, for no doubt this was the Mazidariga who had whistled Obo’s pseudo-Spark into its own stomach. 
 The Hrkan Lords were fleshcrafters whose works could rival the perversions of Shis—or so it was rumored—and no doubt some painful twisting of anatomy was hidden under that Mazidariga’s muzzle, and no doubt it was the work of a twisted mind, for this Riga’s eyes were a child’s eyes, large and curious, yet their whites were so red that their edges were weeping blood, and worse still, the creature seemed accustomed to it.
Next to this Riga child was a tall bald man clad in the baggy blue robes of a Hrkan scribe. All the fat on his body seemed to have settled in his face, giving him a curiously large head for his frame. It was such an incongruity, and scribes were such venal creatures, that Mandri wondered if this man had bribed some younger, fitter person for the use of their body. It was either that, or he, too, was the work of the Hrkan Lords.
This scribe did not look at all pleased to see Mandri. No scribe ever was, for scribes of rank were learned men of acquired power, and they kept their silver sunrose brooches bright and blinding. They put so much effort into setting themselves apart that they could sense when someone didn’t appreciate them. 
The man looked down at Mandri, and with plain derision in his voice he said, “Another coward lurking in the rubble.”
The Riga child coughed, as if clearing his throat of sores, then said through its muffling mask, “I smell the Mazid on him.” There was no hint of menace in the child’s words—it was merely a statement of fact. 
“Yes,” said the scribe, thoughtfully. He turned to address the soldier who’d captured Mandri. “The young master told you to fetch the Mazid’s body, not another sniveling rat.”
“Yes sir. Yes, master.” 
The soldier saluted again, then ran back towards the rubble.
“And you,” the scribe said to Mandri, “The Law affords you an opportunity to repent of your crimes. I don’t suppose you’ll take it?”
“Uh…sure, I’ll take it.”
The scribe’s lumpy brow jumped up and said, “Very well. Then you shall be delivered to the nearest Lord and be sold into slavery. Someone take him away.”
“Hold on! Hold on. Wait. I haven’t done anything.”
“Oh, you haven’t, have you?” the scribe said, clearly amused.
“I’m an honest Jandri man,” said Mandri. “The people in that rock stole me outside of Meskalem three days ago. I was their prisoner.”
“A prisoner?” The scribe said, and his incredulity slid naturally into a skeptical, chubby-cheeked chortle. “You speak cleanly for an outland poke.” The man then leaned over to address the Mazidariga to ensure the child had the correct interpretation of Mandri’s words.
“This is what we call outland bluster. He is no doubt an outlaw like the rest of them.”
“Is he?” the Riga croaked.
“Indeed he is. He is a liar. We shall keep him along with the other liar so they may be dealt the liar’s punishment.”
The scribe nodded to a nearby soldier, who then dragged Mandri to his feet and led him behind the Hrkan line to where one of the Ayramun, Seb, was being held. 
Seb was so caked in the dust of Minting Rock’s collapse that he looked like a mangled root just dug up from the earth. And through it all, he still smelled. Seb looked surprised to see Mandri, though he did not speak a word of acknowledgment.
“Right then,” said the scribe. “Time to clean this mess up.” 
The Hrkan horn sounded out and the soldiers lurched forwards into a ridiculous parade march, a heel-stomping strut, and they looked proud to do it as if the Hrkan Lords themselves were watching. The scribe and Mazidariga ambled along in front, while both Mandri and Seb were forced at sword point to keep close behind. Soon the Hrkan soldiers came to a halt and spread out into a skirmishing line, giving Mandri a clean view of the corpse of Minting Rock.
The structure, having split in two and fallen apart, now formed two halves of an impromptu arena, with the rubble on either side rising step-like into the air, complete with dead spectators oozing out between the cracks of pancaked floors. Staged on the arena below was the giant Ayram. He stood resolute with four dead Hrks at his feet, one with his nose smashed flat against his skull, another with his face opened up completely. It seemed that Ayram had the artist’s impulse for rearrangement, as well as a madman’s eye for beauty—he seemed to believe that a man’s face was more pleasing to the eye if it were parted down the middle and hanging down around the shoulders.
Behind Ayram, crouching up on rocks like black-scratchers fleeing an incoming tide, were three of his band—Moto, the old witch Elrahet, and Purl.
The scribe stepped forth to address them all.
“The battle is over,” he said. “Lay down your weapons and submit yourselves to the Law.”
The scribe clearly bore no actual expectation that the Ayramun would surrender. This was a formality, and formalities were honored because formality was what separated civilized men from the animals. The difference between a slaughter and the exercise of justice was whether or not it was preceded by an announcement. If one announces what they’re going to do, whatever happens next is the victim’s fault. 
The scribe rolled his shoulders back, puffed out his chest and said, “Since you have chosen life outside of the natural laws which govern all mankind, you will be dealt with according to the law of beasts. You shall be captured and sold in the court of the Great Lord Hababeen. If you persist in your barbarity, we shall undress your weight with a dull blade and feed your trimmings to pigs.”
The scribe’s chubby cheeks spread into a frown as if he weren’t pleased to be issuing his threat—this was also a formality. Mandri had met his fair share of scribes assigned to posts in the Sand, and to a man they were perverted. The strange bureaucracy that surrounds the culling of outland folk attracts them, and the closer they held to the letter of the law, the more perverse was the performance, and the more satisfaction they gleaned.
The scribe motioned for both Mandri and Seb to be brought to him.
 “Toss your weapon on the ground,” he said to Ayram, “Or all of you shall be carved to the bone, beginning with these two skulking cowards.”
Ayram planted the chisel-tip of his giant iron spear into the sand, but he did not loosen his grip.
The scribe grabbed Mandri by the scruff. “Let it be known that the course of law was offered and was rejected.” 
He pulled a short knife from his robe and raised it up so all could see.
“I say one last time—toss your weapon! The light of the law demands it!”
He lowered the knife to meet Mandri’s throat.
Ayram looked like an ancient outland idol cloaked in the dust of untamed earth and anointed with the blood of weaker men. Mandri watched with bated breath as this wildman decided whether or not to surrender to a frail-backed, skinny-fat scribe. Yes, there were Skulsi here too, but never in all the turns of the world could such a man surrender to such a man.
Mandri felt an urge to do something to save his neck, and urges like this one, urges overwhelming, they claw themselves out of the stomach regardless of whether or not they’re welcome in the world. He instinctively squirmed—he knew not why but he squirmed under the firm grip of the scribe, who could sense Mandri’s desperation, but  he’d slit a throat or two before and it seemed he knew how to handle a criminal’s neck. Nonetheless, Mandri squirmed. He hadn’t felt an upwell from his Spark in years—and he was so unused to its working on him that it passed through him all too easily, too quickly, so that instead of coiling him up and unleashing a twist of fury, what came out of his body was a sneeze—a sneeze with snot and spittle—and it came bursting out to fleck the knife and hand of the Hrkan scribe.
The scribe recoiled in horror, as if the flag of snot dripping down the meat of his thumb was the most repulsive thing he’d ever seen. 
“You disgusting poke!” he screamed.
He made to wipe it off on Mandri’s cheek, but before his knife’s tip grazed Mandri’s skin, the tip of Ayram’s spear slammed into the scribe’s chest.
The scribe was thrown back by force. A rasping howl issued from his throat as the spear slid halfway through him and slammed into the earth behind, propping the dying man up like a skewered pig.
Ayram had thrown the damn thing. He’d thrown it over thirty yards and hit his target square in the chest. And he wasn’t done with that—he was sprinting towards the Hrkan line, roaring like the beast the scribe had named him.
The white cloaked Skulsi closed rank to meet him.
Mandri didn’t know what to expect next, but it certainly wasn’t the sight of Ayram leaping over the line of swinging Hrkan swords. The giant came tumbling down behind them and rolled into a run, and three strides later he was standing over the scribe’s corpse and reclaimed his spear. From there, he turned on the chasing Hrkan Skulsi and swung.
Ayram wielded his spear as efficiently as Mandri could handle a brush—a tight economy of strokes. Twenty-something Hrkan men he had to kill, Hrkan Skulsi no less, veterans of battle with bulging calves from all the marching, with manly beards and mule-kicked brows, faces to fear—how many swings of a spear should it take to bring down such a number? Surely the giant would have to waste a twirl or two to parry the swarm of blows against him. Fifty? If not fifty, then twenty? Mandri might have believed twenty if someone had told him the story secondhand.
His disbelieving eyes counted ten.
Ten strokes to kill at least twenty hardscrabble soldiers. Ten powerful strokes. And it wasn’t like Mandri would do in a portrait, where he’d make a stroke and wipe it away until he got it right—there was no room for error here, every sweeping stroke was deliberate and precise, for each had to solve at least two problems at once. Truly, these were the marks of genius. 
When it was over, Mandri wondered why any of it was necessary in the first place. It seemed Ayram could slaughter the world and none would stop him. But when the last white cloak fell, Ayram dropped to his knees. There was a long bloody gash running down his ribs. He had not been perfect, if perfection was such a thing.
The giant drew a deep breath and called for Moto. Moto came running, and as he approached, Ayram said, “Kill the rat.”
At first, Mandri thought Ayram was talking about him, then he thought Ayram was referring to Seb, but when Moto went sprinting past them both, Mandri saw the Mazidariga child running away into the empty desert, running as fast as his little legs could carry him.</Text>

            <Title>Ch13 - Scratch</Title>
            <Text>When Solraheen put His body between creation and the falling Fabled Black, He was buried at the bottom of a deep and pitiless crater. So ended his vigil of the earth. He’d protected creation for an uncountable number of years, and with Him gone, it was corrupted in less than a thousand. Solitants tell the story as if it all happened yesterday. Solraheen was buried, then a drought ravaged the world, spreading the Sand’s extent to every corner of the continent. For a time, the Old Jandri peoples persisted, but then the Ukut river dried up. With the river gone, the tribe called the Gairo could no longer sustain themselves up on the Ukut plateau, and so they swept down into the Sand’s Middle Portion. But it was not the Gairo who ended the Old Jandri world, it was the people whom they butchered and displaced—the Hrks. 
The Hrks wandered the Sand for one hundred years until, at last, Arnaggu led his people out of their suffering and into the Watered Portion. Little in the way of art or architecture survived their barbarian charms. Every Old Jandri shrine and temple had their arches broken and their eternal flames snuffed out. It is said that the only thing that truly survived intact was belief in Solraheen, for the Hrks could not deny what they could see with their own eyes, buried there under the crater at the mouth of the river Jek. The Hrks claimed that holy crater as their own, and inside of it they built their city, Jeket. From there, they conquered the world.

 It reminded him of the Stria which hangs in the entrance hall of the Temple Krait. This painting is large, two men tall and one wide, and in a technical sense the painting is a masterwork—the scene overflows with silk-satin of every color, and silk-satin is a challenging material to paint because it inevitably moves, the reflections change, and so most painters make use of mannequins and glue to keep the folds still, but Stria, inspired by Solraheen, could capture its likeness without reference. The actual subject is a white-robed young man and a red-robed young woman standing in a narrow, window-lit room. Their postures seem confused, their backs are turned to each-other, yet both look over their shoulder at the other. Some say it depicts a boy preserving his honor by refusing the temptations of the young beauty, while others say it is the girl who preserves her virtue by shunning the advances of a besotted youth. The controversy has led to several murders, even though the priests of the temple accommodate either interpretation, for the temple praises chastity above all other virtues, and surely that is the message, for the temple’s dome can be seen in the painting, through the window.
But there’s an unsubtle signal taking place between the two subjects. The girl is thrusting her thumb between two of her fingers, and the boy accepts by making a circle with this thumb and middle finger. It would seem, then, that the temple’s dome is no chastely crown, it is the watchful eye under which two lovers plan a tryst.
When Mandrameen pointed out these suggestive hands to a temple attendant he was told, “Young man, your mind is overwhelmed with lust.” While that might have been true it didn’t matter—Stria was clearly intending to make a mockery of all these prudes. And it was much the same with those crumbling statues of Duror—

This first chamber of Minting Rock was an oblong egg shaped room with Mandri hanging out in the middle of it like an uvula. The bowl shaped bottom of this chamber was carved to look like a liquid, with a tide of concentric rings rippling down it’s concave surface into cresting waves, all in miniature, all of it polished to a sheen as smooth as a Hrkan Lord’s table. Amidst this black stone sea were four stone demons, twice Mandri’s size, carved from the solid rock and holding up the ceiling, full and dynamic figures, scaled and snarling, with backs bent against the room’s gentle curve. Mandri might have thought them real if Hill wasn’t there amongst them, torch in hand, rummaging about the packs scattered around the demon’s feet. Despite the unparalleled quality of the craftsmanship on display, the Ayramun were treating the place as a storage space. Hill paid Mandri no mind as he continued to be pulled upwards.


It was then that he noticed that Mazidobo was in the room with them. The lamplight hardly reached him on the far side of the room, yet his pale head was lying there in the black like a misplaced egg. He was still playing dead, but he kept one eye open, squinting out at the world. Mandri couldn’t help but laugh, and Obo smiled back.
“What’s funny?” Seb asked.
“It’s nothing…nothing at all.”
Seb looked over at Obo and back at Mandri, trying to gauge the meaning of Mandri’s lingering smirk.
“It’s my leg,” Mandri said. “Just have to laugh at the pain.”
Seb stared down at Mandri’s blood-splattered leg.
“The demon that bit you, what’d it look like?”
“It looked a bit like those statues down below.”
Mandri went on to describe the demon that bit him, as best as he could remember, bulging eyes and all. As he laid out the extent of the horror, Seb’s borcandi spine slowly slipped out of his lip and dropped to the floor, and when Mandri finished describing the feeling of the demon’s toxin squeezing his insides, Seb gulped, realized he’d dropped his spine, and then fumbled around in his own shadow for it. Eventually he found it, pinched that slobbery mess back up and stuffed it right back in his cheek.
“I been out here thirty somethin’ years,” Seb said as he rolled the borcandi around his mouth with his tongue, “An I never seen no demon like that. Nothin’ nearly like a man. Demons come in all kinds—lizard-like, beetle-like, bird-like, mostly small-like. Man-like demons crawlin’ out the ground is a bad omen. You seen any other demons?”
“No, I don’t think so—except for this old woman. Well, I thought she was an old woman, but she could fly and eat Sparks. You ever seen anything like that?”
Seb rolled the borcandi spine around his mouth. He said, “She could do what?”
Mandri answered plainly, “She flew right into my ox’s chest and ate its Spark. She had fangs. It was horrible.”
“I ain’t even heard of a thing like that. You best work on your storytellin’ some, cause that’s not close to believable.”
“I saw what I saw.”
“You didn’t see shit.”
“How would you know?”
“Because you’re a burgeon biter.”
“Burgeons have nothing to do with it. I saw what I saw.”
“I been biting burgeons since you were in the womb, an when I see folks turn into demons and start eatin’ Sparks, I don’t go believin’ it.”
Seb’s admission to biting burgeons set Mandri’s stomach itching, because if Seb were a burgeon biter then he’d likely have a few bulbs in his pocket.
“You have burgeons?”
Mandri cringed at his own question because he sounded so desperate. Dying had quelled his bone-crave for burgeons, but there was still a little hole in the pit of his stomach which food or water couldn’t fill. 
Seb bent over, brought his sun-leathered face even with Mandri’s, and like any self-respecting burgeon biter, he dodged the question.
“You didn’t see no woman eat no Spark.”
“But I did.”


, they talk about ridiculous things and they look scared while doing it because they're worried their words will have them out as being ridiculous. They bite hard on things like borcandi spines and burgeons to keep from talking too much. 

From the outside, Minting Rock already looked unstable, like a god-sized bliggu nut standing tip-toe on its stubby stem.

Then the Hrks built Jeket on top of Him and they took that eightfold sun and put their own sign, an eight-fold compass rose, right in the middle of it.

But, ancient corpses don’t smell—at least Mandrameen didn’t think they did. At least one of these graves had to be recently inhumed. Probably, it was the first one he’d touched—the middle hole on the right hand wall. From what he could see of that corpse, it didn’t seem particularly fresh, though from his position on the floor he could only see bits and pieces.

Seb was now standing right behind her, hovering over her shoulder, chewing on a fresh borcandi spine. He was munching it right by her ear.
“You’re blocking the light,” Purl snipped.
Seb moved back, then cleared his phlegmy throat and said, “Don’t do anything yet.”
“This needs to be cured. Now.”
“I wanna question him first.”
“You two can talk while I’m working.”

Seb crowded once more into the light. In his hand was a knife with a blade as long as the string of spit which dangled down from his lip. He handled the knife playfully, limp-wristed, and he swung in and out of his own cast shadow. Twice, the handle threatened to slip out of his seemingly careless fingers and Mandri flinched. If Obo was concerned about the blade slicing into his stomach, he didn’t show it. 
Seb swallowed back the flood in his mouth and said to Obo, with a little more diction, “I don’t like listenin’ to you talk.”
Seb pointed the knife straight at Obo’s nose.
“That’s unfortunate,” said Obo, “Because I like to talk.” 
This drew a gurgling hiss from Seb’s cheek.
“You killed good people in those hills,” Seb said.
“I’m sorry to hear that. In my defense, I didn’t have time to separate the good from the bad, as they were all shooting arrows at me.”
“Oh, like they was the ones that started it,” Seb scoffed.
“Seb, where is this coming from? You of all people should know I don’t kill when I don’t need to, because I could have killed you, but I didn’t. I had every chance, but you were no threat to me, hiding under that bush.” 
“I was not hiding!” Seb seethed. He was bending over now, with his blade near enough to Obo’s cheek to kiss it.
“There’s no need to justify a cowardly act,” said Obo. “I would have done much the same.”
Seb’s eyes flashed thunder and his jaw went stiff. He pulled back, pulled the knife away, and somehow the distance was even more threatening, for he seemed all the more likely to snap and pounce.
“I didn’t mean to offend you,” said Obo. “In a sense, it’s a compliment, because to call a man cowardly is to confirm that he is not a coward—you are like a coward, but not a coward. I know you’re not a coward Seb. But you are the most cowardly man I’ve ever met.”
Obo’s insult nearly knocked the borcandi spine from Seb’s cheek. That would have been the second time the crunched-up spine had dropped. The man simply didn’t have enough teeth to keep it nestled, and to make it all even more difficult, Seb kept half the spine hanging out to keep it dry so that it’d last longer.
“Seb, you’re blocking the light again,” said Purl as she sat back in the folds of her robe. “Don’t you have something better to do?”
Seb sipped a breath and twirled his blade about in little circles as he tried to think of an excuse to say. Mandri could tell that he was not a man who could leave a conversation without feeling like he’d won it, and when a man’s not got the gift of wit, a knife will often do. Thankfully, a shout for Seb came echoing out from the corridor behind. 
“Count your blessings,” said Seb, and though the words were meant for Obo, it was Purl who whispered thanks to the heavens when Seb left to heed the call.

And he wasn’t about to sit down and revel in a final moment while a battle unfolded. He’d never seen a battle before. He’d once seen an alley fight with ten men, six against four, a dispute over some patch of land out in the country.  The six outnumbered the four, but if you only took raw bulk into consideration, the four had the upper hand. Elbows cracked skulls and there was a lot of blood, but it wasn’t a proper battle. It was more of a skirmish. Mandri wasn’t sure where the line between a skirmish and battle was, and he hoped that these proceedings could shed some light on the matter.
 He was about to ask Obo his opinion,

Tacitus 56-120

Annals - 

Tacitus would write an account of the actions taken against the christians, hom he spurns for their “hatered of the human race,” that is, for their studied aloofness from roman society. 

Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilatus,​29 and the pernicious superstition was checked for a moment, only to break out once more, not merely in Judaea, the home of the disease, but in the capital itself, where all things horrible or shameful in the world collect and find a vogue. First, then, the confessed members of the sect were arrested; next, on their disclosures, vast  p285 numbers​30 were convicted, not so much on the count of arson as for hatred of the human race.​31 And derision accompanied their end: they were covered with wild beasts' skins and torn to death by dogs; or they were fastened on crosses, and, when daylight failed were burned to serve as lamps by night. Nero had offered his Gardens for the spectacle, and gave an exhibition in his Circus, mixing with the crowd in the habit of a charioteer, or mounted on his car. Hence, in spite of a guilt which had earned the most exemplary punishment, there arose a sentiment of pity, due to the impression that they were being sacrificed not for the welfare of the state but to the ferocity of a single man 



The New Oxford Annotated Bible commentary on the passage notes it this way:
The angels are probably the “sons of God” in Gen 6.2 who had intercourse with mortal women and fathered a race of giants. Like other Jewish writers of the period (e.g., T. Reuben 5.6), Paul evidently fears that the angels will be aroused to lust by the sight of exposed women.
This goes along with a general belief at the time, shown by the popularity of the Enochic literature and other pseudepigraphical works about fallen angels and their lust for women. These texts expanded on the stories of Genesis 6. Here's Francesca Stavrakopoulou in God: An Anatomy:
This is likely a stripped-back version of a much fuller myth describing the corruption of the earliest humans. It is found in its longer form in a composition called the Book of Watchers, an early version of which is included in a text known as 1 Enoch (c. fourth century BCE). Here, the Sons of God are the Watchers – a group of 200 divine beings who function as God’s emissaries (or ‘angels’). Unable to resist the charms of mortal women, the Watchers descend from the heavens to have sex with them, but defile their holiness in the process by engaging in what is essentially depicted as cross-species sex. For the women, however, sex with these divine beings is not defiling, but enlightening: the Watchers teach them the divine secrets of magic, medicine and metallurgy, so that they can not only better harness the powers of the cosmos, but render themselves even more beautiful by making and wearing magical jewellery. Meanwhile, the giant Nephilim born to the women go on the rampage; having gobbled up the earth’s supply of food, they begin to devour humans. It is only when God’s senior emissaries (the archangels Michael, Sariel, Raphael and Gabriel) hear the cries of despair from mortal men that they ask God to intervene and rid the world of all its dangerously corrupted life forms – hence the Flood.
It is a story that would remain popular – and alarming – within ancient Jewish and early Christian circles. Indeed, by the middle of the first century CE, Paul was alluding to it when he insisted that women should keep their heads veiled or covered during prayer and prophecy ‘on account of the angels’, to prevent them from attracting the attention of the divine beings watching over worship. And by the beginning of the second century, the story had become a repeated motif in Christian teaching, warning human sinners of God’s punishing ways, much as the New Testament letters of 2 Peter and Jude suggest.
Despite the lack of canonicity of 1 Enoch in most church traditions (Ethiopian Orthodoxy aside) it remains extremely influential on later conceptions of fallen angels and on the New Testament itself.

Hegesippus - 110-180
- Hegesippus' works are now entirely lost, save eight passages concerning Church history quoted by Eusebius. Through Eusebius, Hegesippus was also known to Jerome,[7] who is responsible for the idea that Hegesippus &quot;wrote a history of all ecclesiastical events from the passion of our Lord down to his own period... in five volumes&quot;, which has established the Hypomnemata as a Church history 

Eusubius - 260-339

Josephus - 37-100 (90s)
while historian Mary Smallwood, in the introduction to the translation of The Jewish War by G. A. Williamson, writes:
[Josephus] was conceited, not only about his own learning, but also about the opinions held of him as commander both by the Galileans and by the Romans; he was guilty of shocking duplicity at Jotapata, saving himself by sacrifice of his companions; he was too naive to see how he stood condemned out of his own mouth for his conduct, and yet no words were too harsh when he was blackening his opponents; and after landing, however involuntarily, in the Roman camp, he turned his captivity to his own advantage, and benefited for the rest of his days from his change of side

Antiquities of the Jews
	-  After this, on the second day, he placed the heaven over the whole world, and separated it from the other parts, and he determined it should stand by itself. He also placed a crystalline [firmament] round it, and put it together in a manner agreeable to the earth, and fitted it for giving moisture and rain, and for affording the advantage of dews. 
	- at that time the serpent, which then lived together with Adam and his wife, shewed an envious disposition, at his supposal of their living happily, and in obedience to the commands of God; and imagining, that when they disobeyed them, they would fall into calamities, he persuaded the woman, out of a malicious intention, to taste of the tree of knowledge, telling them, that in that tree was the knowledge of good and evil; which knowledge, when they should obtain, they would lead a happy life; nay, a life not inferior to that of a god: by which means he overcame the woman, and persuaded her to despise the command of God. Now when she had tasted of that tree, and was pleased with its fruit, she persuaded Adam to make use of it also. Upon this they perceived that they were become naked to one another; and being ashamed thus to appear abroad, they invented somewhat to cover them; for the tree sharpened their understanding; and they covered themselves with fig-leaves; and tying these before them, out of modesty, they thought they were happier than they were before, as they had discovered what they were in want of.  

-Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, 9 those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; 10 as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day. 

As is common with ancient texts, however, there are no known manuscripts of Josephus' works that can be dated before the 11th century, and the oldest which do survive were copied by Christian monks 


A different set of external arguments against the authenticity of the Testimonium (either partial or total) are &quot;arguments from silence&quot;, e.g. that although twelve Christian authors refer to Josephus before Eusebius in AD 324, none mentions the Testimonium.[73][74]
Even after Eusebius' AD 324 reference, it is not until Jerome's De Viris Illustribus (c. AD 392) that the passage from Josephus is referenced again, even though the Testimonium's reference to Jesus would seem appropriate in the works of many intervening patristic authors.[73][74] However, Bart D. Ehrman and John P. Meier have argued that this silence is mainly due to the fact that the original Testimonium probably had a neutral tone toward Jesus and did not contain elements that would have been useful to Christian apologetics, since it did not recognize him as the Messiah, nor did it speak about his resurrection; it was, therefore, not a useful instrument in their polemics with Pagan writers
Look at ships too: Though they are so large and driven by harsh winds, they are steered by a tiny rudder wherever the pilot’s inclination directs. 5 So, too, the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it has great pretensions. 

For every kind of animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is subdued and has been subdued by humankind. 8 But no human being can subdue the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. 9 With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse people made in God’s image. 10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. These things should not be so, my brothers and sisters. 11 A spring does not pour out fresh water and bitter water from the same opening, does it? 12 Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers and sisters, or a vine produce figs? Neither can a salt water spring produce fresh water. 


Origen 185 – c. 253 


JAMES;

Adulterers, do you not know that friendship with the world means hostility toward God? 

So whoever decides to be the world’s friend makes himself God’s enemy. 


Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and make your hearts pure, you double-minded. 9 Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter into mourning and your joy into despair. 10 Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.

Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that town and spend a year there and do business and make a profit.” 14 You do not know about tomorrow. What is your life like? For you are a puff of smoke that appears for a short time and then vanishes. 15 You ought to say instead, “If the Lord is willing, then we will live and do this or that.” 16 But as it is, you boast about your arrogant plans. All such boasting is evil. 17 So whoever knows what is good to do and does not do it is guilty of sin.


For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. 

Plutarch - the superstitious man enjoys no common world with the rest of mankind


1 Corinthians 11:10 


Come now, you rich! Weep and cry aloud over the miseries that are coming on you. 2 Your riches have rotted and your clothing has become moth-eaten. 3 Your gold and silver have rusted and their rust will be a witness against you. It will consume your flesh like fire. It is in the last days that you have hoarded treasure! 4 Look, the pay you have held back from the workers who mowed your fields cries out against you, and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of Heaven’s Armies. 5 You have lived indulgently and luxuriously on the earth. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.

            <Title>Misanthrope Obo</Title>
            <Text>This was the common thread to Obo’s daily gibes—he didn’t think highly of humans. As the days wore on he talked more and more about what people got up to without the guiding light of the Hrkan world.
He spoke of how, in the distant age of temple cities, there was an Old Jandri custom that forbade anyone from selling land. The purpose was good-natured, as the wise sages of those cities had enough history to know what causes a city’s collapse, for wealth attracts wealth just as sand attracts sand, and inevitably the wealthiest end up with everything—all the money, and all the land. Since the people have nothing, they either leave or simply rebel. 
To combat this, the city sages decided to prevent the sale of land so that a family could persist for generations regardless of what the rich wolves were up to. Land could be had only through inheritance. If a childless couple found their work too heavy in their old age, they could adopt a few straight-backed persons to till their fields and reap the harvests, and these children could stand to inherit on the condition that they provided grain, oil, and clothes to their adoptive parents for as long as the old folks lived.
But the rich were too clever for it. Judges were bribed, councils were captured, and by hook or by crook they weasled their way into the lines of succession. This practice carried on for more than one hundred years in the heart of Old Jandri. What began as a few rich, wicked schemers evolved into wicked consortiums of ‘sons’ who shared pools of silver and gold from which poor landowners were forced to turn to in times of drought, signing over the birthright of their trueborn children to the rich. Such was the depravity that a single man was once the adopted child of five-hundred and fifty-two different sets of parents. 
According to Obo, this was the birth of the Old Jandri banking system. The pretense of adoption was shed and more sophisticated systems of accumulation were devised. It wasn’t overthrown until the Hrks came and put a stop to it.</Text>

            <Text>“No backtalk—and that goes for you too, Seb. You been getting uppity these days, and it’s time to stop.”
Seb scoffed at this sudden turn. 
“I don’t backtalk,” he said. “I give suggestions.”
“No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
When Ayram was confident that Seb had absorbed enough of his ire to fall in line, he turned again to Mandri.
“You understand?”
Mandri nodded.
“Say it.”
“I understand.”
“Good—but for now you’ll be following Moto.”
Moto perked up. “Me? Where are you going?”
“I’m going to scout for the Hrks,” said Ayram. Then he added, smiling, “and if I happen to smash a demon’s skull on the way, then the world is better for it.”
“Where you want to meet up?”
“Greskalun or no Greskalun, we’re going to Shulgi. If the Mazyd was right, it will be empty. We’ll meet up there, in the highest columned room. If you’re not there, don’t worry…I’ll find you.”
With that, he grabbed his iron spear and leapt up the western slope, jumping from rock to rock with a dexterous, grace that defied his giant frame.
His leaving left an uneasy silence which stayed unbroken until Elrahet growled in disappointment. Without Ayram to carry her, she’d have to walk.
She climbed out of the pack and stretched her legs.
“Whose going to carry these two?” She asked, kicking the bag of bodies.
Moto, standing a little straighter now that he was in charge, said, “I think it’s time Mandri pulled his own weight.”
Moto reached down into Ayram’s pack and pulled out Obo’s pale and lifeless corpse by the neck. Then he grabbed Mandri’s litter and stuffed Obo into it as best he could.
“I’ll carry Obo,” Mandri said, “but I’m telling you, I cannot carry both of them. My back is already near breaking.”






All this would have been enough to drag Mandri’s thoughts away from that black and belching stomach, but Seb was sitting at the head of Shulgi’s stairs, sitting on top of her pack with that dead Riga child still bundled to it, and the man was slurping and chewing his borcandi spines with unusual ferocity.
“How many of those spines do you have?” Mandri asked him. “You’ve been chewing them nonstop since I met you.”
Seb puckered his lips and sent a wad of spit flying down the stairs. He watched it until it disappeared, then said, “I chew ‘em till there ain’t nothin’ left. A single spine goes a day. Seven a week. Got a hundred and two left.” He gave his pack a few hearty slaps and the Riga’s head juddered.
“I know you took a burgeon,” he said.
“A burgeon? What are you talking about?”
“Uh-huh.”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“You see anythin’ special?”
Mandri turned and looked for Moto. The man had climbed up above Shulgi’s entrance viper. He was sitting sideways in the circle of the snake’s eye, scanning the distance for Ayram.
Seb said, “I can see the Hrks.”
“Where?”
“You must be blind, ‘cause I’m half-blind an’ I can see ‘em.”
He pointed out to the cracked expanse again. Mandri expected to see a white line marching out on top of it. Then he saw a faint orange glow flickering in one of the distant cracks. In fact there were two bright spots, glowing, one further back, seemingly stuck and not moving, and one maybe halfway out, wandering in the wrong direction. Outside of these two blooms of light, the canyon curves were many times blacker than the night that was creeping in. Trying to find Ayram in them would, no doubt, be a hopeless endeavor. 
Mandri asked Seb, “Ayram’s not going to fight them all, is he?”
Seb spat again, and lubricated his lips with his tongue before speaking. 
“He’s layin’ a false trail,” he said. “Helpin’ the Hrks get turned around in them canyons is be easy to do, ‘specially at night. Lots of places to get lost. Ya know they don’t call it the Shattered Plateau for nothin’. Its got doublin’ back places, sideways places, and whatnot. Hard to just keep goin’ straight.”
“Where is he?”
“You’d have to have the eyes of a bat to find Ayram in those canyons.” 
Moto voice called out from behind, “I see him!”
“That was quick.”
Mandri looked down at the crack that led up Shulgi, half-expecting to see Ayram charging out of it and leaping up the steps, but he wasn’t there nor anywhere else. Mandri scanned up and down all the cracks that weren’t so obscured by canyon curves, but he saw nothing. 
“He’s so god-damned fast,” Moto declared as he rolled his disbelief, jealousy, and admiration into a sigh. This was, Mandri supposed, the closest Moto could come to actually expressing something resembling respect. It made Mandri want to find Ayram all the more. He realized he’d never actually seen the giant sprinting. Ayram doing anything was a physical feat, he could be taking a shit and Mandri would want front row seating.
Still, he saw nothing.
Moto said, “If I didn't know better, I'd say that he's spooked.”
Seb twisted around and said to Moto, “What makes you say you know better?”
“It's Ayram. The man doesn't get spooked.”
Mandri, eager to be included, said, “I don’t see him. Where is he?”
Seb pretended to wonder if Mandri was blind, then pointed out at the shattered plateau, and said, “He’s right there.”
“I don’t see—oh.”



“Shit!” Moto yelled. He clambered out of the snakes eye, and when the distance was manageable, he jumped down. His eyes were alight with worry. He grabbed Mandri under the arm and said, “Get inside.”
“What is it?”
“Damn it, get inside!”
He threw Mandri back towards the temple and started to manhandle Seb.
Seb shook his arm free from Moto’s grip. “What’re you on about?”
“Do not argue with me, Seb. Get inside, or I’ll make you.”
“What’s got you so—”
Moto grabbed Seb’s shoulder and lifted him up. Seb, being the much smaller man, didn’t fight it, though he did make it as hard as he could letting his heels drag. Moto dragged him right past Mandri, gave him a look that could boil bone.
“If you don’t get your ass inside…” he said, and he left Mandri to imagine the details.
Mandri ran after him, but took one last look out at the shattered plateau. Ayram was still hurtling towards the temple. He was rapidly approaching a crevasse that would, surely, be too wide for even him to jump. 
He didn’t slow down.
“No way,” Mandri muttered.
Afore the gap, Ayram’s stride lengthened into a bounding skip—one, two, three—his fourth step pressed off the edge of the crevasse, and he launched himself into the air. His momentum was incredible.
Suddenly, from out towards the pass, a thin beam of golden fire exploded into the night, zipping right towards Ayram. It rushed at the speed of a lightning flash, and so brilliant was its light that Mandri couldn’t help but blink.
When he opened his eyes, Ayram was gone. A cloud of dust swirled in his wake. A long black scorch mark scarred his landing zone.
Moto’s hand grabbed the neck of Mandri’s robe and pulled him into the temple, and without so much as a word of warning, Moto dropped him on the floor.
“What was that?” Moteah asked. She had seen the flash but not the source.
Moto shouldered his pack and said, simply, “Mazydfire”.
“How close?”
Moto did not answer. He marched through the hall and stopped next to Elrahet. He asked her, brusquely, “Where to?”</Text>

            <Title>Deep Well</Title>
            <Text>The next morning they stumbled upon a deep well in the middle of nowhere. None present had ever seen it before, though Elrahet claimed to have seen it, only she’d completely forgotten about it. It was huge, two-men wide, and included a full set of stairs zig-zagging down to the bottom some fifty yards deep. Moto lowered a bucket. The water it contained was salty and brackish, and there were fish in it. They were the ugliest little minnows Mandri had ever seen—blind fish with pulpy membranes where there should have been eyes. The Ayramun stopped and cooked the lot of them in a stew. It was not delicious. Afterwards, Seb began an argument with his own damned self.
He said, in between squelching chews, “If you take a barrel full of water and put a live fish in it, the water overflows, but if you put a dead fish in it, the water don’t overflow.”
He’d claimed this implied something or other about the Spark, but then he’d immediately discount it, and he went on like this for half a hand until Obo asked the man if he’d ever actually put a dead fish into a barrel of water. Seb said he hadn’t, so he filled a bowl with water, put a dead fish in it, and found that water overflowed.
He did not know what to make of this.</Text>

            <Title>Pile Of Dead</Title>
            <Text>A long year ago, Mandrameen decided to quit painting. In the weeks leading up to that moment, he’d laze the days away in the halls of a lesser member of the guild of Lords, a governor named Eruhd. Mandri drank the prince’s wine, stuffed his face with peach chicken potstickers and prickled lizard pluck, all the while admiring the paintings of the Lady Fremell.
Mandri liked Fremell’s work. She had no equal—surpassed by many, yes, but no true equal. She was decent. She was a painter’s painter, and that meant that the subtleties of her brush were completely lost on the Hrkan elite and her tremendous talent went largely overlooked. Mandri saw in her a kindred spirit, and he was inspired by almost everything she did and that included how she died—she killed herself by jumping from a balcony that overlooked the sea.
Mandri had scribbled a few compositions of that moment, the moment just before the jump. The lady standing on a white stone banister, her waist-length hair wind-blown against her figure, hugging her, when nobody else would. Unfortunately, Mandri could never find someone who was willing to put up the funds for the finished piece.
On one of those lazy days spent idling around in the prince’s halls, Mandri saw a curious and rare sight—one of the twelve Hrkan Lords was admiring Fremell’s paintings. The old man stopped to contemplate each piece, a curious sight because this Lord was the Lord Gagan, a rough and tumble fellow who’d clearly risen up from the lower rumble of the guild of Lords, a battle hardened fanatic who looked more likely to chew on the canvas than admire its deft use of color. He wasn’t the usual foppish wimp that makes a show of art appreciation. And Lord Gagan struck his most thoughtful pose before Fremell’s greatest work, a painting titled, “The Shadow of the Goriol Valley”.
Mandri’s opinion of the painting was that the painting was a work of meager genius—meager genius, because Mandri could not admit anyone as a true genius. The painting was good. It was a view from the low Goriol Valley trail, looking up at the ridge line which sheltered the valley from the eastern winds. The sun was setting behind that ridge, so most of the scene was covered in shadow—blues, purples and muddy grays that seemed almost burnt when nestled against the cooler hues. Near the bottom, in the middle distance, was a sinuous, slow flowing creek. Its water was blood red. That’s the first thing the viewer sees as one walks towards the painting from afar, for not only is the creek spotlighted by the sun peeking over the ridge, but the composition is structured in such a way that the eye is drawn to a stepping-stone waterfall that’s set on a golden third. Below this waterfall, bobbing in its pool, is a brown lump of something strange. Step a little closer to the painting and it becomes clear that this lump is a face-down, lifeless body. The water isn’t just blood-red, stained as such by clay or vegetable matter, it is literally blood, for the shadowed valley slope above is carpeted in human corpses.
One almost has to squint to see the bodies, but they are there, soldiers all, brown bodies folded and crumpled on top of each other like a storm from the Abari highlands had ripped through the valley and dumped them there. 
Lord Gagan said, “I think this is the worst painting ever made.” 
No doubt the Lord had seen a mound of bodies before. Probably, he’d ordered them made. Perhaps the Lord was suggesting that Fremell should have painted fruit and flowers instead, because such a sheltered woman could not possibly capture the greater meaning that a well bloated body presented when it was piled on top of twenty others. Mandri had never seen a pile of the battle dead, and he always assumed that he never would. He would never know if the Lord’s chiding remark had merit. Then the battle of Minting Rock happened and a good seventy something Hrkans died, nine Ayramun as well. When the fighting was finished, Ayram directed whoever was left to gather up the dead, Hrk and Outland alike, and put them in a pile. 
They were to be piled into the shape of a sphere. Mandri was not told why it should be a sphere instead of a regular old pile, nonetheless, that was the order. And because a pile of bodies does not naturally take a sphere’s shape, Mandri was conscripted to construct a large bowl out of Minting Rock’s rubble. Mandri spent the afternoon building that giant bowl, and he did a terrible job, on account of the hobble in his leg and his general desire to be useless. When the bodies were tossed in, they didn’t make a sphere, they made a regular old lump. Thankfully, no one seemed to care, as an effort had been made and an effort was enough. Mandri supposed everyone was too exhausted to be angry. And it wasn’t only the enemy they were handling, it was their own friends as well, so the mood was grim. There were also those desiccated giants, the ones that had been tucked away inside of Minting Rock’s tombs for who knows how many centuries. In the collapse they’d split apart like twigs and whatever was found of them was tossed on top of the pile like kindling.
By twilight the grim deed was finished, and Mandri was allowed to creep away and rest against a heap of rocks. There he sat, alone, munching on some Hrkan hardtack, and his thoughts turned to that painting of the Goriol Valley and the Lord Gagan’s chiding critique.
This pile of dead did not resemble what Fremell had painted. There was significantly more blood in Fremell’s vision, and Fremell’s dead bodies were more seductive, though that was just how people were painted, living or dead. Her bodies were well-muscled and well-naked, or half-naked, and they looked like they’d just stepped out of a bath instead of choking each-other in the sand. It was a typical dramatic device—the perfection of youth cut down before their time—but Fremell’s message went further than that, for Fremell came from a school of artists who thought they had important things to say. Fremell’s painting was a commentary on man’s abiding concupiscence, for what is war but a perversion of lust and desire?
Fremell’s battlefield lay strewn with naked men lying upon naked men. They had all come down from their passionate trance, where reason gave way to baser instinct, where they wrestled, where their limbs tangled and their weapons, phallic, penetrating, stabbed into slits that bled. It was all quite pointed and homoerotic, with eyes rolled back, jaws slack, because ecstasy and death often looked the same and so did war and sex—if one side isn’t satisfied, perhaps they go at it again until everyone is utterly spent.
Mandri surveyed the rubble of Minting Rock, as well as his own memory of what had transpired, and there wasn’t a lick of sexual energy in any of it. There’d been excitement, yes, but that did not last long. Whatever relief there was, was firmly put to bed as soon as the bodies of the dead were tallied.
Forty’s body could not be found, and that set the mood of the Ayramun careening into a fog of gloom. She had been well-liked. Seb had seen her jump into the fray, before the collapse, and that meant she was entombed in the bottom of Minting Rock’s central well.
Chopper’s death was unnecessary. He’d lived through the collapse, but in a fit of chop-lust he sprinted towards a Hrkan soldier and was walloped by Ayram’s spear. Ayram was not forthcoming about precisely how it occurred, all he said was, “The idiot got in the way”. But Chopper’s body told the story—his sternum was cracked, and his lips were stained by his own blood, for he’d died choking on it.
Bush-headed Tob had been unlucky. He’d survived the first half of Minting Rock splitting off, but from the way that Moto told it, the second half’s collapse sent a leg-sized shard of stone whistling down in Tob’s direction. If Tob had been standing a step to either side, he would have survived.
The old witch Elrahet survived, as old witches always do. She was busy mumbling some witchy incantations as she laid her hands on the pile of dead. Purl was beside her, managing a meager flame that illuminated nothing but her handless arm as she tried, pitifully, to shield it from the wind. The rest of the surviving Ayramun—Ayram, Seb, Moto, and Moteah—kept themselves busy trying to salvage what they could from the destruction. They’d already looted the dead for anything useful, mostly foodstuffs—the Hrks had brought plenty of hardtack with them, and it was all wrapped neatly in crinkly brown-leaf squares, each stamped with the sigil of Hrk.
The only thing Mandri took for himself was a pair of leather pouches tied together by a stiff gut cord—it was Tob’s collection of rocks, one sack filled with luck, the other filled with bad luck, maybe ten pebbles apiece. Mandri had plucked them out of the dead man’s robes because those rocks were Tob’s life’s work and Mandri respected the effort. He half-believed the rocks were charmed, because if a person can be lucky then why not a rock? And the pouches were more than just the rocks inside them. They were the kind of thing Fremell might paint to get her message across. She might have put them hanging off the hip of a foreground figure to let everyone know this particular man was manlier than the rest. Mandri dangled them about and wondered why he never noticed this kind of thing unless it was in a painting. In life, pouches were merely pouches—in a painting they’re a token of testicular virility. Tob had been walking around with these pouches for who knows how long and not once did Mandri point and laugh.
“It’s all bullshit,” Mandri muttered. He was referring, of course, to everything—his leg, his skin sticky from sweat, Fremell’s attempt to impress the world, and the Ayramun, too, because all their friends had just been slaughtered and they were already moving on. They were glum, sure, but it didn’t feel like that was enough. Not a watery eye in sight when someone should be wailing. Poor Chopper. Poor Tob.
And Obo was gone. He was the only one of them willing to speak to Mandri on even terms.
Unfortunate.
Mandri thought about humming a song for Obo. Obo wasn’t human and he didn’t have a Spark, but he was deserving of a song, and if not a song, at least something more than a mere remembrance.
Mandri groaned against the thought that he shouldn’t even be here. He should be back in Meskalem, laying in his field getting high on burgeons.
High as the uglies on a too-tall horse.
Folks in Eez call it tickleberried.
All he had to show for his many travails was two pouches of charmed rocks and a wafer of brown Hrkan hardtack. 
Mandri looked down in his lap and pulled one of the lucky stones out. It was quite striking, for a stone, for it was two completely different stones, one half beige, the other chalk-white, which had somehow fused together to become one.
Seb had been idling nearby like a dried out lizard. He said, “You know thems only rocks, right?” 
Mandri replied, “I’ve cheated death about five times in the past four days, so I’m starting to think that luck is real.”
“No such thing as cheatin’ death,” Seb said. He spat a wad of the thick goo into the sand, then added,  “If there is, everyone been cheatin’ death every moment of their lives. Shit, since you been sittin’ there you breathed ‘bout a hundred times—that’s a hundred deaths you just put off, but I don’t see you thankin’ luck for the miracle.”
“Breathing is not a miracle.”
“Tell that to folks that can’t breathe. Friend of mine once died when he was sleepin’. Wasp flew straight in his open mouth and stung him in the dangly bit. Thing swole up the size of my uglies.”
“Sounds horrible.”
“An it could happen to you. Could happen any given moment, but I don’t see you prostratin’ yourself every second, thankin’ luck for keepin’ the damn wasps from uggin’ up your throat.”
“Well, in case it’s necessary, I will give thanks.” Mandri opened his arms to the reddening sun and said, “I thank you Luck for keeping the wasps off me!”
Seb snorted and smirked. He appreciated the sarcasm.
“No one’s special,” he said. “Everybody is who they be and that’s all they is.”
“I don’t disagree.”
“Wouldn’t matter if you did. The gods are playin’ a game an’ that’s all there is to it. An’ you best believe me—‘cause you might catch sight of the hand of Solraheen, and you best be ready.”
“Right,” said Mandri, flippantly. “The last time I heard someone talk about Solraheen’s hand, it was from a priest getting his head chopped off.”
“What’s a priest losing his head got to do with it?”
“He was arrested for stealing the legs of the Lybion martyrs from the temple of Jeetz.”
“Horseshit. Them legs are as watched as the sun.”
“That’s why they caught him and put him on trial. And you know what he said in his defense? He said the hand of Solraheen directed him. He said if Solraheen didn’t want him to have such sacred relics, then Solraheen wouldn’t have allowed the theft to occur in the first place.”
“And he were right.”
“The judge said that if Solraheen wanted that priest to keep his head, Solraheen wouldn’t have allowed the man to be caught.”
Seb nodded without appreciating the of irony. “That’s how it is.”
They both sat there, staring at the mound of bodies, Seb in wistful repose, and Mandri leaning away, trying not to sniff Seb’s smell. The man was still as dirty as when that Hrkan soldier had pulled him out of the sand. He was as comfortable in that skin as a dog who’d been rolling around in mud.
Eventually, Seb stood up and said, “Come on.” He brushed off his ass, as if that would do anything to wipe away the absolute filth that covered him. “I been lookin’ for the Mazid’s body all day, an’ now that you're free, you’re gonna help me find it.”
“Why?”
“Because that’s what Ayram told me to do, an’ now that’s what I’m tellin’ you to do. Let’s test your luck, maybe you find him before me.”
Seb and Mandri spent the next hand and a half looking for Obo's body. They had no luck until Mandri got tired of looking and decided to apply himself. He realized that if he’d been thrown clear of the destruction, then Obo probably had as well. From there they checked around where Mandri landed, and sure enough, there was Obo, still swaddled in black, his head and shoulders buried in the sand like he were an arrow loosed from a heavenly bow. Seb didn’t want to touch Obo, so Mandri pulled him out alone, though this didn’t require much effort. Mandri found himself hoping that he’d feel Obo wiggle back to life once shaken, but no, he was as lifeless as any of the other bodies, and nearly weightless in comparison. And his skin was much paler, even by Obo’s standards.
At Seb’s urging, Mandri carried the little torso of a Mazid back to the makeshift camp in the middle of Minting Rock’s rubble, for that is where Ayram sat.
The giant had his broad back turned, uncovered, and he was sitting on wooden stool that had been scavenged from wreckage. The witch Elrahet was checking this incredible wall of flesh for wounds. The stool squeaked and groaned every time Ayram shifted his weight, but he was perfectly silent as the old witch sewed up a thin gash that wrapped around his side. As she worked, she washed away the sand from his skin with a wet rag. His was a tightly sculpted body, animal skinny and strong. Each time Ayram lifted his arm to give Elrahet clearance to scrub, the striations in his shoulders popped and his shoulder blade melted into a pool of rippling muscle.
“Seb, you soilbucket!” the giant shouted when he noticed Seb approaching. “Did you find it?” 
Seb ducked under the words with a reverent bow. “When did I never do what I said I was gonna do?”
“Good.”
“Put it over there,” Elrahet snapped as she pointed with her elbow.
Laying on the ground nearby was the Mazidariga child, dead. Mandri laid Obo down next to it. Both were swaddled in black, with only their faces open to the air. They looked oddly like siblings—their skin had that same cloudy pallor. Obo was the bigger of the two, or he would have been if he hadn’t been quartered.
Ayram sighed and his shoulders slumped. Then he slapped his knees and he stood up, against Elrahet’s protestations. He twisted back and forth to test the stitchwork that riddled his side, and when this sent a thin stream of blood dribbling down his ribs, he ripped a long, thin strip of wool from a white Hrkan cloak and bandaged himself up. While he was tying the knot, he pointed with his chin towards twin corpses, Obo and the Riga.
“Let’s do it,” he said.
Elrahet grumbled, then waddled over to the corpses and shooed Seb and Mandri aside. She then straightened the bodies out so that they lay flat on their backs, bellies even, and she knelt in between their heads, making sure the skirt of her robe folded nicely to make a pillow for her creaky knees. 
From nowhere, a golden blade flashed in her hands, shining bright in the light of the sun. The sight of it turned Mandri’s stomach, for he’d seen one like it flash a slit of red into his ox’s throat. In fact, if his memory served, the two blades were exactly alike. Elrahet carried the same blade that the demon witch Pell had used to turn his world inside out.
Elrahet hadn’t yet sprouted fangs, and she didn’t fly around as if possessed by the wind, but Mandri began to suspect there was some devilish air about her which he hadn’t noticed before.
Elrahet’s head craned towards the sky, and the speech that ushered from her throat was so polluted with guttural urks that Mandri wondered if they were even words. Not even the croaks of vomiting toads sounded so much like her gibberish. As the witch croaked, her words pulled a shimmering, red smoke out from her throat. This smoke wisped and curled like smoke from a candle’s flame, and it followed the direction of her words as if buffeted by them, and it settled around the tip of her golden blade. When the blade was fully sheathed in the red misty, Elrahet slammed it down into Riga child’s belly, burying it up to the hilt.
The Riga child’s eyes flicked open and bulged as if trying to escape its skull, one red eye twisting left, the other twisting right. Mandri wondered if its brain might be exploding, and then Riga’s whole body juddered, its legs spasmed. Elrahet pushed down on the Riga’s hips with her free hand to steady the creature, and when the jerking finally settled down, Elrahet ripped the blade from the stomach, bent over the wound, then set her lips upon it.
Every fiber of Mandri’s being wanted to look away from this unholy sight, but he couldn’t—such is the allure of dark and twisted things. The Riga wasn’t human, but it looked enough like an innocent child that Mandri felt shame for staring, and he nearly fainted when the witch slurped up blood from the hole in the Riga’s belly. 
Elrahet pulled her head away from the Riga’s corpse, mouth shut tight, withered lips painted red, and she swung around to kiss the lips of Obo. But of course, it was more crude than that—she squeezed Obo’s jaw open, and spit the contents of her mouth into Obo’s throat—mostly blood and chunks of viscera, but along with it came a formless gray light, the same light that Mandri had seen zip out of Obo’s body back in Minting Rock.
Elrahet shut Obo’s jaw, clenched it tight with her leathery palm, and set to whispering that guttural language into Obo’s ear. Next she whispered to his throat, then to his chest, as if beckoning the pseudospark along to finally come to a rest back in Obo’s stomach. When she was finished, she set her ear to Obo’s heart, closed her eyes, and listened. 
A stillness settled over those gathered as they waited for something magical to happen.
“Fetch Purl!” Elrahet snipped. “Quick!”
Mandri winced when Ayram barked the name with a force that could shake loose a star.
“PURL!”
A heartbeat later, and Purl came running into the clearing, yelling, “What is it?” She took one look at Elrahet hovering over Obo and understood.
She hurried over and knelt next to Obo’s body, and took a deep breath to compose herself.
“Squeeze the hand,” said Elrahet, and she held up her own bony claw of a hand to demonstrate, clutching some invisible stone, was pumping it with her fist.
Purl held up her handless arm and focused. The wound which had looked so severe only days ago was already free of bandages. The fresh pink skin which splotched the nub of her wrist looked diseased against her natural mocha color. She, and everyone else, was staring at it. All of them imagined her severed hand inside Obo’s chest, squeezing with invisible might. 
Obo’s ribcage thumped.
Sweat beaded on Purl’s brow. 
“Harder,” griped Elrahet.
Purl’s determination deepened, such that she was no longer breathing. Just when it seemed that she would faint, Obo opened his eyes. 
“Sol’s light,” Elrahet muttered to the sky. “I thought it faded.”
Purl sat back into her heels and heaved a sigh of relief.
Bleary-eyed Obo slowly glanced around, took in Ayram’s blood spattered visage, saw the black rubble of Minting Rock around him, and squinted at the pile bodies. His senses were recovering with startling speed. When he turned his head and saw Mandri, his lips crumpled into a weak smile, broken when Ayram’s great paw gripped Obo’s whole head and lifted the Mazid up to lean him against a rock.
Then Ayram turned to Purl and said, “Make it do something.”
“Do what?”
“Make it hiss like a lizard.”
Purl, still kneeling, recomposed herself. She waited until Obo’s eyes were alert and staring back at her, and then she issued a tight-lipped command.
“Hiss,” she said, “Like a lizard.”
Obo smiled, and simply said the word, “Hiss.”
“Did you make him do that?” Ayram asked Purl with a skeptical eye.
“I think so.”
 He asked Obo.“Did she make you do that?”
“I am not sure how to answer that.”
“Answer with the truth.”
“The truth is that if the girl didn’t tell me to hiss like a lizard, I never would have said hiss.”
Elrahet grumbled again. “We don’t have time for this.”
“Speak plainly,” Ayram demanded.
Obo shrugged and said, “The girl’s command was not sufficient cause to compel me to speak.”
Ayram turned again to Purl, frustration tilting his voice. “Make it do something by thinking it.”
Mandri watched with bated breath as Purl whistled out her own through pursed lips. She could, at least, compose herself under pressure. She drew upon her unseen strength, and she dipped into some altered state, eyes rolling back, lips mumbling, and suddenly there was a north-easterly breeze which was not there before.
She reached out with her handless arm again. Her nose wrinkled and Obo’s bald head twitched. When Purl’s glare went wild, Obo’s shoulders crimped and a faint golden glow began to shine through the skin of his throat. He opened his mouth towards the heavens, and Mandri expected to see a blast of Mazidfire issue forth—everyone did—but nothing came. Soon the wind was dead and Purl was back inside her own skin with nothing to show for it.
“Interesting,” said Obo, impressed. “You almost did it.”
“That’s good enough for now,” said Ayram.
“Is it?” Obo asked.
“It is.”
“I know you won’t believe me, but the girl will never be able to control me. Even if she could, there’s still the issue of the Mazidariga.”
“He’s right,” said Seb, who was crouching nearby like a sandrat waiting for someone to drop a crumb of bread. Ayram silenced the man with a sideways glance, and asked, “How many Mazidariga are there?”
“I don’t know,” Obo answered. “But there is a peaceable solution to that particular problem which I’m sure you’ll find agreeable.”
“Out with it.”
“First, I need to know what it is you want me to do. Why did you take me captive? Do you want me to drive Hrk’s armies into the sea? Lay waste to every Hrkan temple? Kill every member of the guild of Lords?”
“There’s no use in telling,” Elrahet grumbled again.
Obo was quick to counter her. “I don’t think that’s true,” he said enthusiastically. “You see, I would welcome a change in the continent’s leadership. The guild of Lords is weak and fractious. They create more problems than they solve.”
“We can’t trust the creature,” said Elrahet brusquely.
“We don’t need to,” said Ayram. “Either it says something sensible, or we ignore it.” He leaned on his spear and asked intently,  “Now how do we elude those Mazidariga children?”
“Before I get to that, please, stop and consider—what is the one thing the Hrkan Lords are scared of?”
“The Mazidai?” Elrahet grouched.
“Yes, but no. You see, I was made to help manage that one thing that checks the Hrkan Lords—that is the Hrkan people. You may think that I was made to terrorize you, but the Lords don’t care about the outland tribes. You’re tangential. In fact, they’ve sympathy for you if you can believe it. The guild is the only thing holding the common folk back from stealing what arable lands you people have left. If you your goal is to plunge Hrk into chaos, you’ll be signing your own writ of doom.”
Ayram chuckled and shook his head. “I know what the Hrkan people are capable of.”
“Then why agitate them?” Obo asked. The force of his argument was working an energy into him. If his arms were able to move underneath his swaddling robe, they would have been going mad. “If you want Hrk to fall cleanly, you have to be precise. You needn’t a Mazid to do this. Kill but a few choice men and women, the ones keeping the corruption in check—as well as a few others who bridge the natural divisions within the nation. Apply some pressure to the right places, and Hrk will fall apart under its own weight, and it would be a more manageable decline. It might take some time, but believe me, Hrk hates itself more than it hates you. Simply get them to no longer want to be a nation, and they won’t be. That will give the outland tribes room to breathe.”
“You speak as if you have experience tearing down kingdoms.”
“How do you think Hrk tore down the Old Jandri world? It wasn’t Mazidfire. Disagreement is a natural impulse for your kind, and if you prey on that, a nation spirals into a cycle of death that feeds itself as soon as first blood is drawn.”
“The thing you don’t understand,” said Ayram, “Is that I don’t care about Hrk. I don’t even care about the outland tribes. What I do care about is killing an Amalgamete.”
“A what?”
“An Amalgamete. A god-swallower. The demon of demons.”
Obo looked deeply into Ayram’s eyes, as if to gauge the man’s sincerity. Mandri, in turn, looked to each of the Ayramun and they were each as clear-eyed and as firm as their leader, well, all except Seb. It’s difficult to know how much dimwittery is inside someone’s head at a glance, but Seb was an exception to that rule because it was dripping from his lip. For Mandri’s part, he was alarmed. He’d never heard of a god-swallower before.
“I don’t understand,” said Obo, stealing the words right out of Mandri’s mind. “If there’s a demon running around, why not let Hrk deal with it?”
Elrahet snapped, “We don’t have time for this!”
Ayram shrugged off his witch and said, “I would not trust Hrk with a .”
Obo was squirming inside his black swaddling robe. If his confusion was a performance, it was a convincing one. “You  went through all this, because you need me to kill a demon?”
Ayram nodded. “A big one.”
“Why not poke it with your spear?”
“It’s a very big one.”
Obo was struggling to come to terms with this news. His smooth dimpled up ob , and this much, Mandri was sure, was not an act. Obo finally asked, “How big is this Amalgamete?”
Ayram slid a side-smile at Elrahet, who returned another testy grunt.
Ayram said, “Let’s not worry about that right now. What we need to do is avoid the Mazidariga.” 
“Well that’s simple,” said Obo. “You can avoid the Riga by giving me a Spark.” He mounted his argument before anyone had time to laugh, and added, “One distant whistle from a Mazidariga will suck the pseudospark from my body, rendering me inert. If I had my own shard of the divine, then it stands to reason that I would be freed from the Mazidariga’s influence entirely, free from its hunt.”
“And you’d be freed from your Minder as well.”
“Yes, but if you give me a Spark, you would be giving me my freedom, and with it I could breath Mazidfire on my own. No Minder would be necessary. In return for your gift, I would slay anything you wished.”
“Hah!”Ayram exclaimed as he rubbed his beard, clearly amused with Obo’s sudden turn. He glanced towards his band and declared, “They breed them selfish, don’t they?”
“Wanting a Spark is selfish?”
Ayram chuckled and then paused to give Obo’s suggestion some consideration. He said, “I don’t even know if it’s possible.”
“What about Mandri?” Obo asked. “I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into his body. I did not believe such a thing was possible, yet here he is. If you could infuse Mandri’s corpse with a Spark which was not his own, then do the same for me.”
Ayram eyed Elrahet and asked, “Can this be done?”
Elrahet was standing as still as scarecrow, staring at Obo, her old joints seemingly stuck as the layers of black tatters draped on her leathery bones drifted against the breeze. She said, “A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require an act of creation.”
Ayram shrugged and mused, “If it can’t be done.”
Elrahet growled, and her hand twisted tight on her cane as she said, “I did not say it could not be done.”
Mandri’s ears pricked up, and the old witch seemed to grow a foot in his eyes as she waddled over to Obo and loomed over his diminutive form.
She said, “Tell me, creature, if you had a Spark, what would stop you from killing us? What would stop you from going back on your word?”
“Nothing,” Obo admitted.
“You see!?” she shrieked. “We can’t trust the creature! We’re better off stumbling blind into a nest of battles.”
Ayram smirked and said, “Damned will be the day that I trust the Mazid to honor words. We’ll make do without its wisdom.”
He then gathered up his spear and said, “Make ready to leave. We’ll just have to outpace the Hrks.”
“Leave to where?” Obo asked.
“We make for the bones of Bullr, and then to Shulgi.”
Obo was unimpressed. “The Bullr basin is surrounded by Hrkan posts. If there was any great demon dwelling there, it would have been noticed.”
“The demon isn’t in the bones, it’s in Shulgi.”
“And where is that?”
Ayram grinned under his bloody bush of a beard and said, “This may surprise you, Mazid, but the Sand is full of terrors beyond your ken.”</Text>

            <Title>Burgeon Theft</Title>
            <Text>Mandri tried on three separate occasions to finagle some burgeons out of Seb. He was denied each time, and each time Seb grew angrier. She got so mad that she threatened to kill Mandri, and when that didn’t work, she threatened to kill the burgeons. 
Then a small miracle occurred.
One night Seb found the corpse of a beautiful blue butterfly. This butterfly had fluttered out into a place where no butterfly should be. Seb claimed it was a sign of the divine, and in digging around her pack’s interior to find a suitable case for it, she pulled out a woolen blanket, and in so doing, unwittingly pulled out her pouch of burgeons as well. The pouch hit the sand and out popped three beautiful God’s Eye burgeons. Two of them spiraled harmlessly in little circles, but one burgeon hit the ground rolling as if flicked towards Mandri’s toes by Solraheen Himself.
Mandri covered it up with his foot. When Seb finally noticed that her burgeons had spilled, she snatched them up, quick as a fox, none the wiser that she’d missed one.
Mandri smiled.
The feeling of that burgeon under his heel was brighter than the moon and stars in the sky, which was quite bright. Yes, the world was blue and comfortable, if a little cold.
When Seb stomped off, he pocketed the burgeon. He wouldn’t use now, for these were prime walking hours. It would be better to save that blessed burgeon juice for the droll, daylight hours. He would ride contentment for as long as it lasted. 
He passed by distant dunes that had dark streaks running down their faces. Obo called them weeping dunes. Large weeping dunes. The dark lines were streaks of water seeping out onto the surface. Obo said that he’d seen dead bodies of men at the feet of weeping dunes. They’d been trying to sop their dried tongues on the damp sand. He called it the cruelest thing—the water is there but you can’t drink it. You’ll only get a mouthful of sand.

            <Text>It was the middle of night when they reached the end of the Tib. Mandri was so happy that he collapsed in prayer. Everyone was ecstatic—everyone but Ayram. His fretful eye studied the north.
“Looking for Hrks,” he said.
They might have made it out of the Tib, but they hadn’t yet survived the danger. Still, their mood was good and doubly so because in the near east was full up with the brown peaks of the Goree mountains. Those mountains had arrived all at once, a long, dark lumpy line looming on the horizon.
The Ayramun picked themselves up and quickened their pace, practically jogging along for the Goree had no hills. Instead it was flat, red-iron dirt all the way up to the mountain chain’s base. The red mountains themselves were buttresses against the desert wind, and as such their rock faces bore the scars of its fury—deep, scoring cuts that swept up and over them.
Ayram led them south in line with these mountains, towards the Goree Pass.
Mandri asked Purl how Ayram knew where they were relative to the Pass.
“He remembers it,” said Purl, as if that were a perfectly adequate explanation. Mandri knew that Ayram couldn’t have dead-reckoned it all the way from that little desert temple near Minting Rock. The featureless Tib would have made that impossible, and the arc of the sun was more of a guideline than a precise measure.
He considered asking the man himself, but decided not to, and good thing too, because the next person who spoke drew Ayram’s ire.
It was Seb.
He had to poop.
Ayram shushed him, but Seb insisted.
“You’re the one that made me eat those flies!” Seb said.
“Alright!” Ayram exclaimed, and he stopped the train. “We’ll make a short camp here. Be quick and quiet.”
“It ain’t gonna be quiet, I can tell ya that. Matter of fact, ain’t gonna be quick, either.”
Seb sauntered off towards the mountains, and disappeared amongst the shadows of rocks.
Mandri dumped Obo onto the ground, then went to Moto and asked for some twigs to make a fire to calm the night chill.
“No fires,” said Ayram. “We’ve got to be quiet, and we’ve got to pass unseen.”
“It’s not only Hrks we’re worried about,” Moto added. “If you don’t know, the Goree’s cursed. If that doesn’t get you, there’s two kinds of tribes in the Goree—those who want to kill you, and those who want to steal all your stuff. Either way, you end up dead.”
“Won’t they have seen us coming from miles away?”
“There’s not much reason for them to be watching the Tib, because it’s not a journey often made. We might have slipped through and if we have, we don’t want to spoil it with a fire.”
“Well, how close are we to the Pass?”
“We’ll be upon it morning,” said Ayram.
“The light of day?”
“Yes.”
“But you just said that everyone wants to kill us.”
“The Goree pass is protected ground, so long as you pass in the day.”
“And who enforces that law?” Obo asked.
“Custom.”
Obo laughed, and this drew a dirty look from Moto. Moto said,  “Custom may mean nothing to you, but desert customs demand respect amongst outland tribes. They have preserved us for thousands of years. Every tribesman knows that if they violate the truce of the Goree Pass, then they are dead.”
Obo said, with ebullient eyes, “I didn’t laugh because I doubted you. I laughed because I believed you.”
“Well, I don’t believe him,” said Mandri.
“But you should,” said Obo.
“No desert custom is going to stop people from looking out for themselves.”
“Have you ever heard of the Old Believers?” Obo asked.
“The who?”
“Elrahet mentioned them a few days ago. The Old Believers  lived in an alluvial plain just south of Cask. They had strange ways of worshiping Solraheen, so to incorporate them into the Hrkan world we had to reform their religion. The plan was to do it piecemeal, over generations, so as not to cause a stir. Don’t start with the religion itself, start with some of their customs to soften them up. The first thing we did is we told them to not write Solraheen with two L’s.”
“So?”
“Guess what they did.”
“They didn’t want to do it.”
“They built warehouses out of resin-rich timber, locked themselves inside, and then burnt them all down. An entire tribe of ten-thousand people killed themselves in one night. They killed themselves and their children over a single L. If you ever make it to Jeket’s library, you should look for a book on the histories of the Old Believers.”
“I’m not going to do that.”
“Outland tribes are tickled by custom.”
Elrahet had been sitting silently by herself, brooding as she’d been want to do since they’d entered the Tib. The next words she spoke were her first in several days. “You’re the Mazid that killed the Old Believers?”
“Are you not listening?” said Obo. “They killed themselves.”
Elrahet turned her back. Ayram said that was enough noise for the night, and they took up shelter behind a jumble of boulders which blocked the western wind. Ayram shared some stern words with Seb when he got back from his fecal excursion. All save the giant lay down to rest.</Text>

            <Text>Mandri walked that day in silence.
What he’d seen was difficult to comprehend.
Obo was also confused, but he was also eager to hash it out.
Obo started off with an apology, because he didn’t want Mandri to think that he’d lied—he had said before that it was impossible for Mandri to be a Minder, yet Mandri had almost succeeded in calling for the Mazidfire. It was clearly possible.
If Obo had legs, he would have tripped over himself trying to explain why he couldn’t explain Mandri’s near success. But Mandri knew the causes at play—he had literally seen them, shining white threads pulling up his arm at Elrahet’s suggestion.
The truth was that he hadn’t done anything.
He explained to Obo about the God’s Eye burgeons, about what he saw, about how it was all Elrahet, that she’d controlled him, and she’d controlled him easily.
Hearing this, Obo’s excitement at Mandri’s near success disappeared.
“I think I know why I was chosen,” Mandri said. “I’m chosen precisely because I’m so weak. I’m too easy to manipulate.”
He walked on, carrying Obo, into the gloom of night. He heard Ayram tell Seb to not venture so far ahead. He said that from now on, “We stick together.” Seb became prickly after that. Call her name and she’d respond with a despondent sneer.</Text>

            <Text>Under his feet were some holes burrowed by some strange species of yellow-headed lizard. At night those lizards escaped from their haunts and searched for food. He could see them silhouetted against the starry sky. Their mounds were covered with picked cleaned bones of all manner of mouse, lizard, ground-nesting birds, and berrybush.
He wondered if these lizard mounds had once been cities. There were lizard mounds lining to the horizon it seemed, and beyond that to the ends of the earth.
A distant lizard sent forth a screaming hiss into the night. Other lizards from other lizard cities immediately took up his challenge, and for a good few hands the peace of the starry sky was upset by the hissing, hacking, and crying of those foul, foul beasts. </Text>

            <Title>King Sixa's Column</Title>
            <Text>The next afternoon they stumbled upon a smooth black column sticking up out of the sand—a plain granite column, not Fabled Black
“You should read it,” said Seb. “It’s gotta sign on the bottom. Funniest shit I ever heard.”
Mandri wandered around the column’s base, while the Ayramun hid from the sun for a while in the column’s long shadow. Since Mandri couldn’t read Old Jandri, he had to turn around and let Obo translate the words graven into the stone plaque.
“The first bit is too scuffed to read,” said Obo, “But the rest says, ‘Things are said of her Kings that are shameful to relate, in particular regarding Sixa the Very Great, the first King whose seat was in Duur. The falseness of those cunning lies is proved in the light of their unverifiability. Let it hereby be declared and known—Sixa the Very Great never had relations with a cow.”
“They made this whole column to announce this?”
“‘Moreover,” Obo continued to read, “King Sixa’s son, King Shura the Extremely Great, never hid his true sins and errors. Whoever wishes to know them has only to read his ten-thousandth Kingly Decree, or hear his heavenly vision from the good harvest of that year. In none of these is it revealed that he is the result of mixed breeding.”
“You’re making that up.”
Elrahet was sitting on the column's plinth nearby. She said, “The column wasn’t put here by Shura, it was put up by his enemies to make jest at his expense.”
“But why put it in the middle of nowhere?” Mandri asked.
“The middle of nowhere? Wasn’t always the middle of nowhere. Was once the middle of everywhere. This  spot of desert was once the womb of cities.” She gestured broadly out at the Sand with her cane. The raw landscape was subtly colored by a host of stubby, gray-green pencil weeds and crawling bushes. In the distant south was a line of dune-brinks, topped with smoky spindrifts, and in the distant north, flying high, was a flock of wheeling, screaming blackbirds fighting over the scraps of some unseen corpse. There were no cities in it, nor even the ruins of one. 
“Each mound of dirt you see was once a city.”
Mandri looked again, and every quadrant of the horizon was studded by at least four or five great mounds which Mandri had taken to be the natural work of the earth. They were even standing on a mound. The thought that what was under his feet was a city was laughable.
Elrahet smirked and said, “They aren’t Hrkan cities, mind, these cities here were small and made of clay. Houses of unbaked brick, plastered with clay. Thatched roofs covered with clay. Each year, a fresh coat of clay. The rains came and the clay washed down from the walls and into the street, so more clay was added. The mounds grew up.” She stabbed the mound with her stick. “That’s how it all started.”
From then on, Mandri never called the Sand empty. It was as empty as a graveyard, which is to say, not empty at all.</Text>

Speciation in Mammals and the Genetic Species Concept 
Robert J. Baker, Robert D. Bradley 

https://academic.oup.com/jmammal/article/87/4/643/962134

Taxonomic and systematic literature pertaining to issues concerning species, speciation models, and whether species even exist in nature is voluminous. Even if one restricts the review to vertebrates and narrows the topics to species concepts and how to theoretically recognize species, the literature is impressive (e.g., Claridge et al. 1997; Coyne and Orr 2004; Howard and Berlocher 1998; Wheeler and Meier 2000). Further, the definition of “species” includes remarkable disparity concerning complexity, criteria, and application. For example, 4 definitions include phraseology such as “re-productively isolated from other such groups” (Mayr 1942:120), “tokogenetic entities that function in the phyloge-netic system” (Wiley and Mayden 2000:74), “the smallest aggregation … diagnosable by a unique combination of character states” (Wheeler and Platnick 2000:58), and “smallest monophyletic groups deemed worthy of formal recognition” (Mishler and Theriot 2000:47). Employing such variation and associated criteria in an application of “species concepts” would clearly alter the number of recognized species.
Complexity of species definitions is not new; the 1st volume of the Journal of Mammalogy contained evidence of philosophical differences between Merriam (1919) and Taverner (1920) on how to delineate species of mammals. Merriam opposed efforts to invoke the “criterion of intergradations” as a measure of hybridization between morphological types, whereas Taverner (1920:126) stated “the species is a definite entity and its essential quality is its genetic isolation.” Merriam's (1919:7) position was typological and interpreted by Engstrom et al. (1994:181) as a defense of the Morphological Species Concept. Engstrom et al. (1994) proposed Taverner (1920) position as recognition for the Biological Species Concept. However, we interpret Taverner's position as more likely to embrace the Genetic Species Concept (Bateson 1909) than the Biological Species Concept. This difference in opinion by mammalogists, at the time of the origin of the American Society of Mammalogists, indicates that species recognition has been a protracted evaluation of species models and their applications. As noted by Engstrom et al. (1994), Merriam's species concept resulted in recognition of 2 genera and 78 species of brown bears (Ursus arctos) that currently (Hall 1984) are recognized as a single species. Interestingly, a single species of brown bear originally was advanced by Allen (1876) in his seminal work on intraspecific geographic variability in mammals.
&gt;Mammalogists, for the most part, have avoided debate on species concepts, but most investigators follow a particular species definition. Most catalogues and checklists of species, such as Wilson and Reeder (1993, 2005), generally are not constructed under a single species concept but reflect diversity in philosophy of individual authors. Consequently, they appear to be accepted with little reference or adherence to species definitions and with little concern for conceptual standards (species concepts). Historically, there has been moderate to strong support for the Biological Species Concept among mammalogists (Mayr 1942). However, there has been a trend in recent issues of Journal of Mammalogy toward application of the Phylogenetic Species Concept defining monophyletic clades in phylogenetic trees identified by shared derived character states as species. Reasons that the Biological Species Concept has been accepted widely among mammalogists include the fact that all mammals are sexually reproducing and most are diploid (polyploidy is rare—Gallardo et al. 1999; Svartman et al. 2005). Further, there is an historical acceptance that a certain level of morphological difference indicates 2 reproductively isolated species (Corbet 1997), which is the basis for recognition of most allopatrically distributed species of mammals.
Before 1985 and the onset of DNA data sets, most descriptions of extant species of mammals were based on morphological analyses of museum voucher specimens and their associated databases. As early as the 1960s, other data sets (chromosomes, allozymes, scanning electron microscopy, etc.) to discriminate species were available, but they were championed by few mammalian systematists because they often required extensive expertise, expensive equipment, specific types of samples (in vitro incubated bone marrow, specially fixed tissues, etc.), or even laboratory colonies not available to the systematics community at large. Further, most mammalogists concerned with recognition of species and their relationship to other Linnaean taxa were affiliated with natural history museums. This affiliation allowed individuals to share comparative material and permitted systematists to examine closely related species across geographic ranges of taxa under study. Therefore, in almost all cases, the most comprehensive data set available for comparison of potential species was voucher specimens housed in natural history museums.
It is possible that the study of voucher specimens using classical morphology has resulted in a complete and accurate list of species of mammals and that more modern molecular data sets will not reveal many additional species or redefined species boundaries from those recognized in Wilson and Reeder (1993, 2005). However, we argue that there is substantial evidence demonstrating that this is not true.

Methodological advances in molecular biology have led to generation of several genetic-based data sources. These included karyotypic (Hsu 1979; Patton 1967) and starch-gel allozymic data (Hubby and Lewontin 1966; Lewontin and Hubby 1966) developed in the mid-1960s and DNA-sequence data in the mid-1980s. Examination of these data sets demonstrates that there are cryptic species of mammals that would likely not be recognized based solely on classical studies of morphology of voucher specimens housed in museums.
Cryptic species of mammals identified by karyotypes and allozymes.—There are several examples of mammals that are sympatric and behave as separate species that probably would not have been recognized without data from karyotypes and allozymes. These include Thomomys bottae-umbrinus (Patton and Dingman 1968), Sigmodon arizonae-hispidus-mascotensis (Zimmerman 1970), Macrotus californicus-waterhousii (Davis and Baker 1974), Mus domesticus-musculus (Capanna et al. 1976), Rhogeessa genowaysi-tumida (Baker 1984), Lasiurus ega-xanthinus (Baker et al. 1984), Sorex araneus-coronatus-granaries (Hausser et al. 1985; Searle 1988), and Peromyscus beatae-boylii-levipes (Houseal et al. 1987; Schmidly et al. 1988). In those examples and others noted in Corbet (1997), differences that distinguish 2 or more species were chromosomal and allozymic. Many of those species were sympatric, with no karyotypic or allozymic evidence of hybridization. If hybridization was present, most hybrids were less fertile than nonhybrids and introgression was restricted to a narrow zone, indicating that genetic isolating mechanisms had evolved. Consequently, there was justification for recognition of 2 or more species. Although chromosomal and allozymic data are useful in systematics, neither method provides as much resolution as DNA-sequence data nor are they used as frequently today as are DNA-sequence methods.
Cryptic species of mammals identified by DNA sequences.— Over the last 2 decades, a broad-based DNA-sequence data set has become available to examine biodiversity and speciation in mammals. This data set is a product of methodological advances associated with automated DNA sequencing, polymerase chain reaction, universal primers, GenBank, human genome project, biological informatics, software to analyze such data (reviewed 3 February 2006 at http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/software.html), and genetic resource collections associated with voucher specimens. DNA sequencing is available at nearly all research and educational institutions and with GenBank and biological informatics (Baker et al. 1998), studies of local populations or favorite species are possible for many researchers even at smaller institutions with limited budgets and no museum collections.
Initial results from DNA-sequence databases indicate that cryptic species are more common in mammals than previously thought. Some species that have been recognized and described or justified using DNA-sequence data include Loxodonta cyclotis (RocA et al. 2001), Carollia sowelli (Baker et al. 2002), Neotoma macrotis (Matocq 2002), Myotis occultus (Piaggio et al. 2002), Notiosorex cockrumi (Baker et al. 2003), Lophostoma equatorialis (Baker et al. 2004), Peromyscus schmidlyi (Bradley et al. 2004a), Reithrodontomys bakeri (Bradley et al. 2004b), Lagidium boxi (Spotorno et al. 2004a), and Thylamys Cinderella (Braun et al. 2005).
To summarize, there is evidence that species of mammals are unrecognized, and a database of DNA sequences for most mammalian species is now attainable, financially feasible, and rapidly being compiled. It is our position that the DNA database permits substantially more resolution to understand species presence and boundaries than any previously available database. The DNA database permits application of the Genetic Species Concept to understand mammalian biodiversity. Although scientific breakthroughs to generate the DNA database are relatively recent (last 25 years), the Genetic Species Concept (Bateson 1909) is not new, and along with the Typological and Biological Species Concept (Dobzhansky 1937; Mayr 1942), is among the oldest species concepts.
Genetic Species Concept
There are multiple definitions and descriptions of what could be interpreted as a Genetic Species Concept (Avise and Ball 1990; Baker and Bickham 1986; Bateson 1909; Butlin 2005; Dobzhansky 1950; Masters and Spencer 1989; Mayden 1997; Mayr 1969; Muller 1939; Nei 1976; Schilthuizen 2000; Simpson 1943; Taverner 1920). Most of the ideas that relate to speciation models (including the Genetic Species Concept) have been hashed, rehashed, and tweaked in the literature, and it is not our goal to establish a new concept. It is our goal, however, to organize ideas from the published literature into a pragmatic perspective to explore patterns of genetic variation in mammalian taxa and to accurately identify species and species boundaries to better understand mammalian systematics, evolution, and biodiversity. This perspective is intimately linked to the power of resolution that DNA-sequence and molecular data provide to document species boundaries, hybridization, monophyly, introgression, and so on.
We define genetic species as a group of genetically compatible interbreeding natural populations that is genetically isolated from other such groups. Under our definition of the Genetic Species Concept, speciation is the accumulation of genetic changes in 2 lineages (Bateson 1909) that produce genetic isolation and protection of the integrity of the 2 respective gene pools that have independent evolutionary fates. Therefore, the process of speciation depends on divergence in genes, the genome, and chromosome structure (Check 2005), and species exist when the integrity of 2 gene pools is protected as a consequence of genetic differences in their respective genomes (e.g., as outlined in the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller [BDM] model but not restricted to those conditions).
A comparison of our definition of the Genetic Species Concept to the Biological Species Concept, Morphological Species Concept, and Phylogenetic Species Concept is presented in Table 1. How does our definition of the Genetic Species Concept differ from the Biological Species Concept? Under the Biological Species Concept, the definition is “a group of interbreeding natural populations that is reproductively isolated from other such groups” (Mayr 1942:120). In contrast, genetic isolation is the primary feature of the Genetic Species Concept. Because members of interbreeding populations that do not have reproductive or genetic isolation are recognized as conspecifics and because populations that are reproductively and genetically isolated are recognized as distinct species, these definitions overlap between the 2 concepts. Where the 2 concepts differ is when genetic isolation exists but reproductive isolation does not. In this special case, the Biological Species Concept (sensu Dobzhansky [1937] and Mayr [1942], but see the definition of Coyne and Orr [2004] in chapter 1) would recognize the former as conspecific but the Genetic Species Concept would recognize 2 different species. Although we know of no example in mammals where reproductive isolation has evolved without genetic isolation, it is possible for genetic isolation to evolve without reproductive isolation (Table 2). There also are differences in levels of interbreeding (hybridization) between 2 genetic species. These can range from production of no hybrids to all sterile hybrids, to a hybrid zone (or zones) that have all combinations of possible crosses with all individuals fertile and with introgression being trivial beyond that zone. In cases where the integrity of the 2 gene pools is maintained, it is our position that these gene pools represent genetic species. Clearly, examples with extensive hybridization with fertile hybrids do not fit the definition “species are reproductively isolated from each other” (Mayr 1942:120). We predict that when genetic profiles become available for populations currently recognized as conspecifics (Wilson and Reeder 2005), numerous examples of genetically isolated populations that are not reproductively isolated will be identified. Recognizing these examples as genetic species will be the best means to describe biodiversity in mammals.


A.K.A. coarse graining

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITJ3AF3TK5M
-everettian 
Being time bounded is a boundary
Observer takes complexity -takes digestible, into a finite mind.
Observers equivalence things 
-things that aggregate stuff, and things that weighing balances.

Which distance boundary is real, space or time, or neither, or ‘elementary entaglement speed’?Could just be pure computation

We are model making organisms. We are not climbing around the jungle gym of reality, we are climbing around our own models. ALL knowledge is couched inside our models. So, fundamentally, we cannot ‘know’ anything about reality. What we can do is observe reality and make determinations to the extent that our models correspond to these observations.

But even this aspect of quantification is become a problem. Quantification is a boundary defining issue.
And this is the problem with models - coarse graining is fundamentally a boundary making operation. It defines boundaries in which none exist.

Philosophy is an attempt to find the ontological boundaries which *must* be there at the depths of reality. See Plato’s forms - probe reality to find the perfect form it is an emanation of. Or Kant’s categories. Mysticism is a push in the opposite direction, a push towards denying the existence of any such boundaries, an assertion of a Whole, a pleroma.
But notice that we are already philosophizing. We have defined a boundary between Philosophy and Mysticism. It is fundamentally impossible to speak intelligibly without drawing boundaries, i.e. it is impossible for the speaking mind to not be a philosopher and ‘model-make’ the world. This is why the mystic seeks to quiet the mind, to flee from knowledge and knowledge making by entrancing oneself in meditation, so that all boundaries melt away. To achieve oneness with the divine, a mind must abandon knowledge and embrace unknowing.
Then comes the question of whether or not the ecstatic mystical experience is actually achieving anything more than reduction to a base state that then gets interpreted as ‘unification with the divine truth’. 

So this is the central tension between mysticism and philosophy - mysticism posits unity, philosophy posits multiplicity. Nothing can be said about unity, because to speak on it would require defining boundaries which do not exist. In contrast, an infinite number of philosophical statements could be uttered, for it is all fundamentally artificial; even if it does correspond with reality (see infinite possiblity space of models/hill climbing).

The modern mind is one which suspects a fundamental unity that gives rise to a multiplicity…somehow. (Wolfram ruliad). It tries to uncover the unity via multiplicative language. Is that even possible?

Whatever the case, there is this tension, and assuming that this tension is intensional by God, why? For what purpose? Why define a reality which is fundamentally inaccessible to created beings? Is it curiosity about what kind of models get created? Is beauty a function of ignorance/inaccuracy, and so he wishes to see our ignorance on display in the models we create? Is our model creating behavior fulfilling some kind of function a ‘la Teilhard’s Omega Point? 

It is beautiful, in a way, the particular historic context which defines the line of intellectual thought is striking and wonderfully unique in a truly awesome way. It is so very fascinating. But is fascinating the reason for that tension?

Tension - how to get multiplicity from a unity? Wolfram’s ruliad. Computational graph theory. Presupposes some sort of fundamental space perhaps. 


Ontological argument corollary - the greatest god is one which exists and which everything is god.
The first ontological argument in Western Christian tradition[i] was proposed by Saint Anselm of Canterbury in his 1078 work, Proslogion (Latin: Proslogium, lit. 'Discourse on the Existence of God'), in which he defines God as &quot;a being than which no greater can be conceived,&quot; and argues that such a being must exist in the mind, even in that of the person who denies the existence of God.[1] From this, he suggests that if the greatest possible being exists in the mind, it must also exist in reality, because if it existed only in the mind, then an even greater being must be possible—one who exists both in mind and in reality. Therefore, this greatest possible being must exist in reality.  


IF unity is true - why does multiplicity appear? Not how, WHY????
the reason infinite consciousness limits itself is to experience itself. in the same way you can’t experience anything in a dream, unless you limit yourself as something in the dream. even though the whole time the dreamed world and the dreamed body are all one thing 

The nature of thought is to fragment the whole. The fragmentation requires knowledge as belief or concepts. Those concepts and beliefs have been rooted for a lifetime.
Look at the reality that the body cannot function separate from ‘the environment’. Then find out what beliefs and concepts made you think it could.

Nondualism includes a number of philosophical and spiritual traditions that emphasize the absence of fundamental duality or separation in existence 
What sets nondualism apart is its inclination towards direct experience as a path to understanding. 

But is understanding even possible? Understanding requires boundaries - UNDER

Nondualism is distinct from monism,[6] another philosophical concept that deals with the nature of reality.  While both philosophies challenge the conventional understanding of dualism, they approach it differently. Nondualism emphasizes unity amid diversity. In contrast, monism posits that reality is ultimately grounded in a singular substance or principle, reducing the multiplicity of existence to a singular foundation. The distinction lies in their approach to the relationship between the many and the one.[7] 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neither_one_nor_many

&quot;Pure experience&quot; does not exist; all experience is mediated by intellectual and cognitive activity 

[N]o unmediated experience is possible, and that in the extreme, language is not simply used to interpret experience but in fact constitutes experience. 

The idea of a common essence has been questioned by Yandell, who discerns various &quot;religious experiences&quot; and their corresponding doctrinal settings, which differ in structure and phenomenological content, and in the &quot;evidential value&quot; they present.[362] Yandell discerns five sorts:[363]
Numinous experiences – Monotheism (Jewish, Christian, Vedantic)[364]
Nirvanic experiences – Buddhism,[365] &quot;according to which one sees that the self is but a bundle of fleeting states&quot;[366]
Kevala experiences[367] – Jainism,[368] &quot;according to which one sees the self as an indestructible subject of experience&quot;[368]
Moksha experiences[369] – Hinduism,[368] Brahman &quot;either as a cosmic person, or, quite differently, as qualityless&quot;[368]
Nature mystical experience[367]

Church fathers refuse to look through the telescope.

The perennial philosophy

&quot;We can only love what we know, and we can never know completely what we do not love. Love is a mode of knowledge ...&quot; 

Baruch Spinoza's formulation of pantheism in the 17th century constitutes a seminal European manifestation of nondualism. His philosophical work, especially expounded in Ethics posits a radical idea that fuses divinity with the material world, suggesting that God and the universe are not separate entities but different facets of a single underlying substance. In his worldview, the finite and the infinite are harmoniously interwoven, challenging René Descartes' dualistic perspective 

Thomism, though not non-dual in the ordinary sense, considers the unity of God so absolute that even the duality of subject and predicate, to describe him, can be true only by analogy. In Thomist thought, even the Tetragrammaton is only an approximate name, since &quot;I am&quot; involves a predicate whose own essence is its subject. 



God revealing through history

Observation - tension between multiplicity and unity. Exploring the boundary between these.

When the boundaries are violated, we become upset. Causes pain. Constant chafing.

            <Title>Togetherness</Title>
            <Text>The red sun’s bottom lip kissed the west, and Ayram set out into the Sand. He never announced it was time to leave or that everyone should think about heading out, he simply gathered up his enormous backpack and started off.
Mandri didn’t notice Ayram walk off because the colors in the sky were darkening into the most unusual reddish tint. It was a shade he’d only seen in rotting berries. The whole sky in the west was flush with this startling purplish red, and he followed the gradient arc around to the east, and there, suddenly, some hundred yards away was Ayram—a giant lumbering towards a featureless horizon. Beyond Ayram was a much smaller black dot named Seb. Seb had set out even earlier after complaining about how slow everyone was and that she was going to do what she wanted to do. Nobody tried to stop her.
When Elrahet was good and ready to leave, she told Moto to bring the cursed Mazid with him, and she waddled, packless, out into the Sand. Moto turned to Moteah and said, “You heard the woman, bring the Mazid with you,” and then he jogged off after the others. The clank of iron and wood inside his own heavy pack was as good as teasing laughter.
At this point Obo had been gagged by a gray rag, put there at Ayram’s command. Obo gave a muffled plea to be free of it, but Moteah ignored him as she finished reorganizing her backpack to fit in a few extra sheaves of Hrkan hardtack. Mandri sat down on a bump of Minting Rock’s rubble and he studied her features.
Moteah fit the standard rule of thumb for beauty that’s taught to artists at an early age—don’t make too many marks. People start to look ugly if one makes too many marks to bring out the features. If Mandri were to paint Moteah with as few marks as possible, he wouldn’t be lying all that much. A few swipes to capture the sheen of the redding light that defined her high arched cheeks and the youthfulness of her lips and that was it.
She was attractive, no doubt, but if one sits and stares at another human being for long enough, as a portrait artist must do, the features of the face start to lose the illusion that they’re working together for a purpose. It doesn’t matter how attractive the person is. The strangeness creeps in all the same.
Usually it starts with the ears. Moteah had ears. Peeking out underneath her sun-licked, frazzled bush of wiry hair were tiny ears. Mandri hated ears, those odd, fleshy protuberances. It’s as if, when Solraheen was creating people, He took a wad of clay, crumpled it up, and then slapped it onto the side of the head expecting to come back to it later to make it work but never did.
The worst part of the face is the breath. That’s not quite part of the face, but the breath! If there was ever a sign of what a person is, it is the stench of breath. Cover it up by gargling pango juice, but that never lasts long. Little wonder that Jeket has a whole market square dedicated to tinctures and chews that are supposed to suppress the smell of the curdled things hiding in between the teeth, or pasting the tongue, or tucked into tonsil folds. 
But even ignoring all that, and counting only the basics, the structure of the face, everyone is still ugly.
There is not one person alive whose face is symmetrical. There is always, always, some feature which started growing in the wrong direction as a child and kept going with age. Or maybe it didn’t grow fast enough to keep up with the rest when puberty hit. Titled noses. Slanted jaws. Most common is the uneven eyes, or uneven eyebrows. Sometimes the whole face swivels around to one side, and so one cheek gets slapped more than the other. Or it was smushed that way as the head squeezed out of the womb and it stuck, leaving the mentioned with a lopsided smile.
The only parts of the body Mandri liked to look at were the ones he generally wasn’t allowed to look at—a cosmic cruelty, but one he didn’t fret about, because the only reason he liked to look at those bits was because he wasn’t allowed to. He used to be fascinated by the depths inside the eye, but his brush spent so much time nibbling them that they’d lost their sparkle. Now, they were nothing but squishy wet orbs squelching around in sockets. And as it is for outer beauty, so it is for inner beauty as well. Mandri was certain that if he got close enough to Moteah, that if he got a whiff of her breath, so to speak, then the illusion that she was something to be cherished, something more than a walking, talking sack of Sparked meat, well that would crumble. 
Still, she had no obvious tells. Her hawkish features were tailor made for serious moods, and that was Mandri’s preference—a frowning, serious woman. She was even frowning right now. She stood, hands on hips, that timeless pose of the woman waiting for an idiot, and she was frowning.
She was frowning at him.
“Uh, what?” he asked.
“You’re carrying the Mazid.”
“Alright.”
He stood up and walked over to where Obo sat—or stood—Mandri wasn’t quite sure how to define Obo in his vertical state. He was standing on his legs, but his legs were little more than his ass.
“Use the frame,” Moteah said with a sigh.
There was a wooden, L-shaped frame fitted with straps sitting next to Obo. It was the same device morning walkers used to haul sacks of grain to work off drought debt. Mandri tied Obo into it, and once done, he lifted it up and put it on. Thankfully, the frame was the perfect size for his scrawny back, and it even had a waist strap that pulled fast around his stomach, keeping Obo’s slight weight resting kindly on top of his hips.
Mandri bounced up and down to test his chewed up leg, and he was delighted to find that it was making a remarkable recovery.
“Thought he’d be heavier,” Mandri said.
“If you can carry more...”
“Oh, no. No. It’s more than heavy enough.” Mandri made a show of shifting the weight on his shoulders. Moteah’s own pack was a huge, canvas wrapped lump in the shape of a giant bean, with the head of it looming over the puff of her hair.
“How far is it,” Mandri asked.
“The Bullr basin lies a hundred miles east of here.”
“One hundred miles? That far?”
Moteah’s response was to start walking.
Mandri followed after her. “That’s what, ten days?”
“It depends on Ayram,” she said. “Ten days for him would be slow. Have you ever walked for ten days straight?”
“No.”
He looked to see if they were following one of the old charnel roads. If it was there he couldn’t see it, as there was no gentle hump in the earth stretching off into the horizon. It was flat, and even flatter further on.
Mandri returned to the subject of Moteah’s ugliness—her inner ugliness. He hadn’t seen it yet, but was determined to find it out, and an easy way to capture a thing like that was to ambush it. He waited for her to settle into the inertia of the journey, and then he pounced.
“Who do you hate most?”
Moteah’s face scrunched up in bewilderment, exactly what Mandri wanted. This was a tried and true method of finding a thread to pull. Everyone hates someone. Sometimes the question proved too open-ended, he’d have to ask about a specific person, and that would get anyone gossiping, which always tells as much about the person speaking than the person spoken of.
“Why would you ask that?”
“It seems like there’s someone bothering you.”
“You are.”
“Fair. But you know I’m talking about Moto, right?”
She glanced at him, perhaps expecting to find a sense of shame, but Mandri had none.
She said, “It’s a good thing that you’re out here.”
“Why is that?”
“Because the Sand is going to lick your spit until you’re dry.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“You will find out.”
They walked in silence for a finger, and Mandri brooded over his failed attack. He supposed that what had gone wrong was that he’d let her get away with pretending to be someone that she wasn’t.
He said, “You know, you don’t seem like you’ve been stuck out here long enough to be talking about the Sand like that. How did you end up out here anyways, you and Moto?”
“How do you think?”
“Hrks?”
“Amalgamete.”
“Oh.”
“It was a different Amalgamete than the one we now hunt.”
“There’s more than one?”
“There will only be one in the end. There were many in ages before, and likely more will be born as the ages come, but as they find and swallow each other there will be only one.”
“Does that mean you’ve killed an Amalgamete already?”
She nodded. “It hadn’t yet grown into godhood. This was five years ago, back when my grandfather’s tribe lived on the left bank of the Ganni.”
“What happened?”
“A tribe called the Lamargi lived on the other side of the river. They were our enemies. We fought them every year when the redtrout swelled underneath the matted mudgrass which grew in the summer flood. We killed the Lamargi, and they killed us, all over fish. Thinking about it now, I can’t believe it. It was senseless.”
“It’s not that uncommon a story,” Mandri said.
“The Lamargi were Old, Old Jandri. They walked naked at night. By day, they wore nothing but hole-cut blankets. On the river they wore bark armor to ward off our slings and arrows.”
“A constant war,” Mandri muttered, as if he’d seen it himself.
“It was constant ambushes,” Moteah corrected. “That breed of fight is worse than whatever happens in war. It was nastier, it was personal, and it never ended. It was always there. You didn’t feel safe washing your robes.”
“That’s how blood feuds work.”
“Yes. Destructive, evil, horrible, it was all those things, and everyone knew it. It was a shame for all of us, though I suppose I was too young to ever truly hate the Lamargi. I never knew my uncles, and I never saw them die. My parents did. Moto did.”
“What does this have to do with an Amalgamete?”
“The only time we ever talked with the Lamargi was if either side sent a messenger across the river bearing the leg bone of a dead relative, and that leg bone had to be painted as white as Solraheen. To harm this messenger was to harm Solraheen. One day a Lamargi man swam across the river bearing a painted skull. We could hardly understand what he was saying, because the Lamargi spoke a sister tongue to Old Jandri. He only knew one Hrkan word, and that was ‘demons’. He’d brought the skull, pointed to it, and said, ‘Demon ugi’—demon did it. He wanted us to follow him back across the river.
“We sent Moto to go with him. Moto came back with a story we couldn’t believe, and so more of us went over. I was one of them. Two days of travel took us to the Lamargi village. The first of the dead I saw was an old man pinned to a thick wooden post. He’d been pinned by his own bones. Something had ripped off his arms, defleshed them, sharpened the bones, and then used them as pins. That was only the start of the slaughter. I won’t go into the rest of it. The children weren’t spared. The Lamargi man pointed each of his dead kin out, at least two hundred of them, and each time, he said, ‘Demon ugi…demon ugi…demon ugi…’ The last hut we entered was his king’s. The Lamargi throne was a plain wooden chair that sat a little higher than the others. It was empty. Our guide pointed to it and he said, ‘Demon agi’—which means, ‘demon is’.”
“He was saying his king was a demon?”
“The story we pieced together was that his king had been ill for some time, and nearing death, the man made a pact with evil to destroy my tribe, but as always happens, evil worked against him. Elrahet says that an Amalgamete is born when a man sells himself to hate, and that is what happened.”
“I see.”
“We set out with the last Lamargi to hunt this evil, but we never found it. We should have, but we were stupid. We didn’t know at the time what an Amalgamete was. It didn’t occur to us that the creature hadn’t finished its mission.  We had no idea what waited for us when we crossed the river and returned home.”
“No,” Mandri muttered, fearing what was coming next. Moteah paused her story to push down the sob rising in her throat.
“My village was destroyed,” she said. “Dead everywhere. Half the people were missing. Any hope for survivors was dashed when we found…I can only describe it as a man with a belly as big as he was. It was the Lamargi king. He was passed out near the center of the village next to a pile of bodies. Each of those dead bodies was missing their stomach. The Lamargi king had eaten them.”
“You were able to kill him?”
“Moto cut off his head. When Elrahet heard the story she said that it would have been the smallest Amalgamete she’d ever seen. An Amalgamete consumes Sparks, and as it does, its stomach grows, and the big ones can birth demons. The Amalgamete we killed was too small to give birth, and good thing too, because if it were any larger, we might not have been able to pierce its skin. If an Amalgamete gets big enough, it can’t be killed. It takes the power of a god.”
“But the gods are dead.”
“That’s why we need the Mazid, and that’s why we need you.” 
Mandri mulled the story over, and he felt a sense of solidarity with Moteah’s cause rise inside him. Her story was a human story, a tragedy hard to hear, and even harder for her to tell even if she had pulled through it admirably. But there was still something gnawing at him.
He said, “Obo tells me that I’m not cut out to be a Minder.”
Moteah chuckled. “He would say Ayram wasn’t strong enough to wield him. If no one can Mind him, then the only solution is for him to receive a Spark. Don’t worry about what a Mazid says. Don’t worry about what I say. You need to focus on yourself. Stop worrying about what everybody else thinks.”
“You people cut off my hand. Elrahet threatens to kill me if I can’t do it. How am I supposed to not worry?”
“Just don’t.”
“I’m sorry, that’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.”
Moteah stopped walking, and when she huffed, Mandri did the same.
“Fine,” she said sharply. “You’ve been wronged. What do you want to do about it?”
“If I’m honest, what I want to do is leave.”
She smiled in mild amusement. “You’ve always been allowed to leave, but you haven’t and you won’t.”
“I can walk away? Right now?”
“If that’s what you want to do, then do it. The Sand is yours.” She gestured wide to the empty landscape. The sun was half-set behind them, and their long shadows jutted out into the west like knives biting at Elrahet and Moto’s feet. “If you want to walk away, then do it. Assert yourself like a Minder. Maybe you’ll wander into the Amalgamete and kill it.”
“More likely I’ll die.”
“That’s not why you won’t leave,” Moteah said confidently.
She then pointed over Mandri’s shoulder, to an isolated patch of nearby scrub bush. Zooming around the bush’s wild branches was a swarm of pinprick dots. There were so many tiny flies that it looked like the bush had a misty, black aura. He could hear the faint hiss of their flapping wings from where he stood.
Moteah said, “Only Solraheen knows how many hook flies are over there. Why are they over there? They can go anywhere—they can crawl into any hole, they can fly in every direction, they can explore the entire world and see sights unseen—but they don’t. They hover in that small, boring spot of air out here in the desert. Why?”
“Tell me,” Mandri said as he braced himself for another bit of folksy outland wisdom.
“Hook flies swarm like that because that’s what they want to do.”
Moteah gave Mandri a considerate smile of unquestionable sincerity. Then she resumed her journey, leaving Mandri standing stock still, gawking at those stupid flies.
Like most figures of speech, Moteah’s analogy had a surface charm that suggested a deeper truth, but it completely broke down upon further investigation. There must be a reason those flies were flying around in a ball, a reason which went beyond base fulfillment. Perhaps there were more primal interests at play. Maybe they’d found water there in that bush, or food, or the bush broke the breeze making it easier to fly in the first place. Most likely it was about sex. They bunch up into a cloud like that because it is the easiest way to bump their stiff little uglies into something that makes them feel alive. Maybe one could say that still lines up with Moteah’s notion of want, but Mandri didn’t get the feeling that’s what she meant. In fact, these Ayramun were the least lascivious group of people he’d ever known—he’d not seen a single lip-licking wink between any of them, and he had been looking carefully.
She called back to him, “Don’t fall behind!”
He called back, “I have to pee.”
Moteah hiked her bean-bag pack further up on her shoulders and continued on. Her pack was so large that it had its own momentum, and she had to move slowly and build up speed until the pack’s forward motion began to sustain itself.
The very moment she was out of whisper range, Obo started wiggling around in his seat, and he issued a muffled plea to have his gag removed. Mandri groaned and reached back and slipped the knot that kept Obo’s gag fastened tight.
“Isn’t she interesting,” said Obo.
“Not really,” said Mandri, lying. “What makes you say that?”
“They’re all interesting. I wonder if they’re a death cult.”
“A death cult?” Mandri asked, concerned.
Obo’s bright voice tilted with excitement as he explained. “They match the pattern—the way they handled those giant corpses inside of Minting Rock, and the way they gathered up those who fell in battle, Hrk and Ayramun alike, into one big pile. Most would keep them separate.”
“That pile of bodies was supposed to be a sphere,” said Mandri as he recalled the back-breaking work he’d done to make it happen.
“That fits. Compress them all into a tight ball, for in death all Sparks will be joined together.”
Mandri shrugged and said, “Killing everyone would bring peace on earth, wouldn’t it?” And suddenly, he had to pee. As he relieved himself, a small brown lizard came crawling out of the sand to lick at the beads of urine that splashed down. As soon as it realized the liquid wasn’t water, it scurried back down into the sand.
Mandri said, “But if they want everything to die, then why try to kill the Amalgamete?”
“Because Death cults will kill each other as much as anyone else. I’m sure that even amongst the darker forces, there are schisms. They probably kill each other for the right to kill everyone else.”
“How many Ayramun did they start out with? Fifty?”
“I believe it was forty-three.”
Mandri scanned the horizon—it was wide open space in every direction. There weren’t any hills to hide behind, but the shadows behind every bush were dark as Fabled Black.
He said, “What do you say to walking off in a different direction?”
“I don’t think you are actually allowed to leave, and if you were, I doubt they’d be happy if you took me with you. I think the correct decision here is to continue on.”
Mandri wiggled his member and dropped his robe.
“Let it be said that I think this is all a bad idea.”</Text>

            <Text>It was dark and foreboding, yes, but the objects that lay strewn around the brown rock floor were too banal to be instruments of some evil scheme.

So he’d been raised from the dead.
That was interesting.
Perhaps more interesting was that these ratty bandits had somehow captured a Mazid. The Mazidai were the cornerstones of Hrkan Lordship, yet 

One quick glance at this spot of sunlight was enough to imprint a white circle into Mandri’s vision that stayed true wherever he looked. 

“But there’s mechanics to it. There’s little quirks you got to learn by experience. Like you may wonder why I was restin’ on Papi’s clothes, considerin’ they’re unlucky. I did it because when your sleepin’, unlucky things will drain the unluck out of you, and good luck things will drain the good luck out of you—but that’s only when you’re sleepin’.” The man’s stubby finger was jamming the air, trying to direct the understanding right into Mandri’s Spark. “Cause things work different when your sleepin’ than when your awake. Like if you’re awake in a river you sink, but if you sleep you float like log.”
“What?”
“You ever try swimming while sleeping?”
“Uh...no.”
“You can’t. I’ve tried. And when we’re awake and moving about and decidin’ things, it’s the normal mechanics of luck and things rub off onto you. But like I say, there’s quirks to it.”
“Sounds interesting.”
“Ain’t it?”
Forty sighed and said, “He’s putting you on, Tob.”
“No he’s not, he gets it.”

Forty groaned and said, “He talks all this shit, but he won’t ever back it up with a bet.”
“I don’t bet,” Tob said. “It’s not morally correct for me to be takin’ advantage of others in matters of luck. Not when I’ve got my stones.”
“What if Ayram wanted them?” Mandri asked.
Tob cocked his brow and his mood soured. “What?” he asked.
“Well, they’re not your rocks, right? They’re Ayram’s. You said everything was Ayram’s.”
“What do you mean?”
“You said that everything was Ayram’s,” Mandri repeated. “ You said that everything is ‘loaned out’. That includes your lucky rocks, right?”
Tob glared at Mandri as if Mandri had just insulted his manhood.
“Now why would you want to know about that?” Tob asked.
“I was just wondering. You said that—”
“No, No. I want to know what you’re on my lucky rocks for?”
“You brought them up. I was just wondering.”
“Don’t be out here wondering,” Tob said. “Wondering about other people and what they’ve got or don’t got will get you into trouble. So you just worry bout your rocks and I’ll worry bout mine.”
“Sorry.”
“Damn right you’re sorry.”
“I told you not to get him started,” said Forty. “Why don’t you just sit down, and wait like the rest of us.”</Text>

            <Text>The first object of note was a half-buried corpse of a large lizard, maybe half Mandri’s size. It was freshly dead from the storm, though it didn’t look like it, as most of its flesh had been stripped down to the bone.. What was left was being torn up by a small horde of flying beetles that looked like green jewels. Seb briefly stopped to collect as many of these beetles as he could. He offered one to Mandri, but Mandri declined. Seb said, “They’re good chewin’, but I don’t got the teeth for ‘em anymore.” He proceeded to suck out the beetle’s innards through its rump like it were an oyster.
A few feet away from this dead lizard was a living one of the same species. Moteah called it a garool, and she said they slept unstirred under the sand for years until the rains came, and they’d wake up, mate, lay eggs, feast, then return to their quiescence. A charmed life, if not for the fact that this one’s partner was dead.</Text>

            <Title>Shis</Title>
            <Text>Sheldruub is the Old Jandri word for the final stage of rebirth, characterized by a staticky prickling at the edge of the mind. It is the same word ascribed to the wild slosh of ocean foam that gets beached during a world storm. Such storms can blanket an entire coast six feet deep with salty pale-brown spume. When the storm eventually passes and the sun shines down, the air becomes saturated with the hiss of an uncountable number of bubbles popping through the course of days. The noise is not loud, it’s simply there and it is everywhere, a sound whose source can’t be placed and so it becomes something like the wind, a force of nature, hardly noticed except for when it disappears, and when it does there comes the sight and memory of solid ground—though the ground is not the same as it once was for the storm has ravaged it.
 Mandrameen didn’t notice the Sheldruub. He didn’t notice the feeling of his own blood pumping through his veins and tickling his insides. He didn’t notice these things because he was afraid, and he was afraid because his first rekindling thought was that he was dead and that this was the afterlife and that he was a cold corpse floating in a black void. The signs were unmistakable. His very bones felt frigid and his whole face was numb—if his face was there at all. There was the unmistakable putrescence of rotting flesh. Mandri knew the smell so well because when he was a child, rats frequently died underneath his tiled floor, and he’d have to endure the smell or sleep outside. The first night he slept outside, a spawn of gilt flies got to him. When he woke up, his whole left cheek was covered in hard red welts the size of fingernails, and since the other half had been safely nestled in his pillow he looked like he’d been slapped in the face by disease.
The smell of rot was always upsetting, especially now, because, presumably, that smell was coming from him.
And he could not move. Dead things do not move, therefore, he was dead.
Yet, he could breathe. His breath was icy coming out of his throat.
He tried again to move but neither his legs nor arms would bend. He wasn’t sure if he had legs or arms at all, for he couldn’t truly feel them—there was only a general chill where his legs and arms should be. As he was coming to terms with the idea that his mind had been decoupled from his flesh and that all these sensations were but phantom memories and that his consciousness was floating somewhere inside his decomposing corpse, his eyes opened. They didn’t open far for they’d been glued shut by the crust of death.
He was confronted with a low sandstone ceiling directly above him, a ceiling stained black with soot that flickered in a meager firelight. It was a natural stone, a familiar texture where the rocky surface was smooth, craggy, and porous all at once—a difficult thing to capture with a brush. It was a surface unmarred by the clawing rake of chisels, making it clear that this was no tomb, or mineshaft, or one of those rock-hewn hermit homes that pock the Hias. A cave such as this, Mandri surmised, could only mean that he had been borne down to Shis. 
He could not move his neck, but he could see that the cramped walls of his cave bulged out in places and disappeared into pitch-blackness in others.
Surely, this was Shis.
It didn’t quite match his expectations.
Mandri closed his eyes and conjured up an image of the dark earth riddled with pockets of air like this one, each one occupied by a waking corpse like him, each person forced to endure the mire of their own stench for an odd eternity. He found it pleasant. He wouldn’t be bothered in a place like that. There’d be no obligations. And since he was already dead, he didn’t have to worry about food.
Suddenly, he had the full use of his neck. He looked down at his body and saw that he was wrapped tight in a brown woolen blanket, and he lay flat on a bed of straw. He thought it was strange for place such as Shis to provide simple comforts. He looked to his left, to the source of light in the middle of the floor, and was surprised to see that it wasn’t a tongue of fire piping up from the bowels of the earth. It was, instead, a small flame dancing on a thick wick which bathed in a shallow clay tallow bowl. Its scant yellow light was just enough to illuminate a pale and naked creature who lay slumped on its side on the opposite end of the cave.
This pale creature was a humanlike, smaller than Mandri. It looked like something between a scrawny pubescent boy with gangly proportions, and a hairless, wingless bat. In truer light the thing might not seem so ghoulish, but in the yellow dimness it resembled a jaundiced dog huddled up against the world. Its deathly pale skin was obscured all around by streaks of crusted mud. This creature was so skinny that its stringy tendons were almost as large as its muscles, and its deeply furrowed ribs shuddered with its every breath. Its stomach was grossly distended, and its narrow shoulders were naturally hunched. Mandri supposed the creature was a ‘him’, but he wasn’t sure, for its groin was completely smooth and lacked any sign of gender. But ‘he’ and ‘she’ makes no difference when the subject in question was a demon—that’s what Mandri supposed it was.That’s the only possible thing it could be.
Despite the demon’s deformities, its face was smooth and fair, gaunt, even handsome, replete with a serene expression that was couched in generic Hrkan features—thin lips and sad eyes, all in symmetrical and genderless proportion. And it was alive. Its gray eyes were studying a grievous wound afflicting its chest—a long line of crude, scabbed-up stitches ran up the middle of its sternum and bent over its heart. Two stitches nearer the sternum had burst, leaving a red-lipped slit that exposed gleaming bone—but that wasn’t the worst of the abuse meted upon this creature, for its hands had been cut off at the wrists. In their place were blood-stained poultices wrapped tight with white scrap. The hands themselves, spindly and long-fingered, were sitting in a far corner of the cave, one stacked on top of the other like a pair of gloves ready to be slipped on.
Why a demon had met such abuse, Mandri was not sure. Perhaps this was a human half-transformed, still suffering through its long punishment. A cell-mate. A vision of what was in store for him.
Mandri had no doubt he would be tortured. And after the torture, there would come periods of healing, hence the stitching on the demon’s chest and the bandaged arms. This all made sense because Shis couldn’t be all torture all the time. There would need to be moments like this of healing to allow time for reflection. And no doubt the torture would fit the crimes he’d committed up on the surface. This creature here had clearly been a thief. Why else would they cut off his hands? The chest wound was harder to parse. The stitches ran over the heart so perhaps this former person had committed a crime of passion. That might also explain the erasure of its genitalia. 
It was such a pitiful sight. It might have been frightful, but the creature didn’t seem capable of moving. It never even looked Mandri. Eventually it fell asleep, and when it did, Mandri felt at ease enough to lay back down and try to predict what style torture was in store for himself.
He thought long and hard about his crimes. He’d never committed any unshoulderable sins, nothing to warrant being impaled on a spike a thousand times or tossed into a lake of fire. People shamed him for giving up on life, but as far as he knew, that wasn’t explicitly forbidden. Who was he harming? No one. Harming himself? Nonsense. He was only trying to find a bit of peace. He found peace by losing himself in burgeons, sure, but if that was wrong then the blame was on whoever had created burgeons, and that was the gods.
He hadn’t killed himself, so there was that. He used to want to kill himself, and when he made the mistake of expressing this out loud. He told a Solitant priest, and the man said he’d kill Mandri himself if Mandri ever said anything like it again. That made as much sense as threatening to throw someone off a cliff after they’ve threatened to jump.
This little reminiscence led Mandri to the conclusion that if Solraheen truly wanted to torture some purity back into Mandrameen’s Spark, the best way to do it would be to put him right back up there on the surface and surround him with people like that teacher. Abusive old folk, violent assholes, the ignorant, the dumb, the vain people. People who don’t make sense—that’s everyone in general, really. Mandri didn’t discriminate when it came to hating people. He himself was a person. He hated himself as much as anyone else.
Was self-hatred a crime against the Spark?
If it was, there could be only one punishment with any poetic significance—he would be made to hurt himself. Somehow this place was going to get him to cut his own throat, or kick his own severed head into a hole. But he wasn’t some penitent pilgrim who took special delight in the cleansing awe of pain, so he’d need some prodding. He might be forced to ingest some mind-controlling substance, or be strapped into some ancient contraption of iron, knives, chains, and pulleys that could bend his arms against his will and make him flay himself. 
He tried to bend his arms, but he couldn’t. He did have arms wrapped under that brown blanket. He could feel them now. Then he saw his fingertips sticking out from under a blanket fold, and like what happens in a dream, as soon as he saw them feeling flooded into them. All at once, he had full use of his arms.
He wriggled around to loosen the blanket, and then pulled his left arm free. It was in remarkably good condition for a dead man’s arm. He tossed off the blanket and was surprised to find that his whole body was more or less how he’d left it. He was still wearing that white tunic foisted upon him by Salavan Soreen. Nothing was black and rotting as he’d expected, though he was much dirtier, as if he’d just been pulled from the grave. 
He sat up and his joints creaked. This drew the attention of that ghoulish demon, whose pale eyes studied him with a cat-like curiosity. Then it pushed itself upright with its elbows, matching Mandri’s pose, and suddenly the creature didn’t seem so helpless. Mandri decided he should look for a way out of this cramped little space.
He stood up, slow and deliberate, half because he didn’t want to make any sudden movements that could be misinterpreted, and half because his muscles simply couldn’t move any faster. He backed up against his side of the cave, neck bent against the low ceiling, and he felt his way along the sandstone towards the shadows on his right.
The rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. So, Mandri shuffled back the other way, keeping close to the rock, staying as far away as he could from the pale creature who watched him with curious intent. 
Mandri’s searching fingers found a wide crack in the rock behind him. It seemed like a dark opening that he could shimmy through, but when he stuck his arm into it, his fingers butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his back exposed in present company, he returned to his brown blanket and straw bed.
There was only one other direction to explore. Behind the creatures right shoulder was a hole in the rock that was wide enough to crawl into. Mandri’s eyes strained to see if it dead-ended.
“There’s no way out that way,” the demon said. Its voice was even and clear, shockingly free of the rankling pain it must be feeling. “Or I should say, there is an opening there that leads straight up, but it is not something you can fit through. I’m afraid it’s just another cranny for the lizards.”
“Lizards?” Mandri asked. The word flew out of his mouth without him realizing he was starting up a conversation.
“Yes. Lizards,” the demon said. It pointed up with the bloody stub that was its arm. There on the ceiling, half-buried in sooty cracks, were a dozen or so black blobs that Mandri had mistaken for shadows. He only understood what they were when one of them squeaked and then scurried along the ceiling towards the unexplored passageway, its tiny talons scratching the rock as it went. 
The demon laughed. It was an inviting laugh, and it had an unmistakable Hrkan lilt. Mandri wondered if this half-boy-half-demon still remembered who it was.
Mandri asked it straight, “What are you?”
“My name is Obo,” said the creature.
Mandri pulled his blanket up tight around his shoulders. “Are you a demon?” he asked.
Obo smiled. His smile was radiant even in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs, but wasn’t surprised, for a disarming smile could be just as useful for a demon’s purposes.
“Why do you think I’m a demon?”
“You deny it?”
“I do. I am not a demon.”
“You look like a demon.”
“How so?”
“Your body is a perversion.”
“Is it!?” said Obo as he studied his own pale self in mock surprise. “You don’t look so well yourself.” Obo leaned forward slightly and said, “I’ve given you my name, so its only fair if you give me yours.”
“I’m not going to tell you my name,” Mandri said flatly.
“You’re under no obligation,” said Obo, “but sharing one’s name is a kindly gesture. I think we could both use a friend, considering our circumstances.”
“And what would you do with my name?”
“I would call you by it. What else would I do with it?”
Mandri had heard stories about what demons did with names. Some outland folk kept their true names hidden even from family for fear of what demons could do if they overheard.
“How about this,” Obo said. “Don’t tell me your name, that’s fine. What utterance should I make to grab your attention?”
“I don’t want you grabbing my attention.”
“Why do you feel threatened by me?” Obo asked, amused. “What am I going to do? Scuttle over there, and then do what? Bleed on you? I couldn’t kill a fly.” Obo held up his two handless stumps to belabor the point.
“Call me what you want,” said Mandri as he drew the blanket tighter around his shoulders. “There’s only the two of us here, names don’t matter.”
“Only the two of us here? Are you sure about that? You missed the lizards, you might have missed something larger.”
Mandri’s eyes darted around the cave, suddenly expecting something to jump out of the shadows. 
“Yes,” said Obo. “There’s that unfounded certainty melting away.”
Mandri eyed the hole of darkness behind Obo.
Obo smirked and said, “No, not there. There’s a person sitting on the other side of that crack behind you.”
“That crack ends in stone, I checked.”
“It ends in a stone door. You can hear him snoring, if you don’t believe me.”
Mandri listened carefully, and he heard nothing. Then Obo started mimicking a snoring sound, his stumpy arm directing the pitch in and out, directing Mandri’s attention towards its steady rhythm. Then Mandri caught it, faintest of faint sounds sneaking out of the crack in the wall to his left—someone was there, snoring.
“Who is it?”
“Our jailer, I suspect.”
“A demon?”
“Unless a demon’s snore sounds exactly like an underfed Jandri man who’s chewed too many borcandi spines, then no, not a demon.”
“You can tell all that from the sound of a snore?”
“Borcandi juice gets phlegmy in the throat. It gives it that—you hear it? It gives the snore that sputtering tune.” 
Obo leaned back against the rock. His casual demeanor at such odds with the ruined state of his chest and arms.
“Is this not Shis?” Mandri asked. “Am I not dead?”
“Do you feel dead?”
“No. But who is to say what being dead feels like? If this is death, then death feels much like living, only colder—so then yes, I do feel dead.”
“You are not dead.”
“But I am dead,” Mandri said flatly. “I was murdered. I remember dying.” 
“You were dead, but at present you are very much alive. When I was brought here you were a corpse. I went to sleep, and then your beating heart woke me up.”
“You can hear my heartbeat?”
“I can hear your eyes blink.”
Mandri instinctively blinked, and then he scowled because he felt like he’d been tricked into it.
“Only a demon could hear such a thing.”
“I’m not a demon.”
“Well, you’re not a human.”
“That is correct.”
“Then what are you?”
“I am a Mazid.”
Mandri’s heart fluttered at the mention, not from fear, but because it actually made a little sense. He’d seen a Mazid before, from a distance. It had the same pale white skin, the same smooth face, the same slightness of size. But he’d never seen a Mazid naked, and surely, the guild of Lords could do better than this.
“I don’t believe you,” Mandri finally said.
“Mazidobo is my full name. To friends it’s simply, Obo.”
“How would a Mazid end up down in Shis?”
“We wouldn’t. We Mazidai have only a dim pseudospark, so we cannot die and be carried to the afterlife. Is it not at least conceivable that we are not in Shis, that your dead body was found, brought down to this cave in the Sand’s Pitted Portion, and then, through some unknown means, brought back to life?”
“Who could have done all this?”
“I assume it was done by the same people who brought me down here.”
“And who are they?”
“I am not entirely sure. My Minder and I were tasked with destroying a band of outlaws who haunted the Junei Pass. These outlaws overcame us. They slayed my Minder, captured me, and then brought me down here. They are a brood of thieves, zealots of a kind, but other than that, I do not know much about them.”
“Now that I don’t believe. A Mazid who can hear my eyes blink gets ambushed by a bunch of outland thieves?”
“Mere incredulity is not a rational argument.”
“If you’re one of the Mazidai you could prove it—spit Mazidfire.”
“My ability to breathe fire is contingent upon my Minder’s mood.”
“I thought you said your Minder was killed.”
Obo pointed with his ruined wrist to the ragged scar that plagued his chest, and said,  “Do you see this?”
“Of course.”
“To control a Mazid, a Minder must cut off their hand, then place it into the Mazid’s chest so that the hand clutches the heart. My old Minder was killed, but as you can see, I have been recently bonded to a new one.”
Mandri imagined someone’s hand swimming around the viscous goo that must account for the volume of the creature’s chest. He shivered and asked, “Why’d they cut off your hands?”
“They were upset with me.”
“Well, do something else that only a Mazid can do.”
“The only other thing that I can do that you can’t is admit when I’m wrong.” Obo smiled at this little twist of wit, and that only made Mandri madder.
“Bullshit,” Mandri said, groaning. “I know the Mazidai have other powers. I know you can read minds.”
“We are observant, and that catches some people by surprise and they leap to fanciful conclusions. I cannot read your mind, else I wouldn’t wonder why you think a place like this is worthy of the title, ‘Shis’. Why even assume that Shis is real?”
“It’s real because people need to be punished for the things they did wrong.”
“The gods don’t seem too concerned about justice in the real world, so I don’t see why they’d be concerned about it in the world hereafter.”
“What would a Sparkless Mazid know about Shis anyway?”
“So you admit that I’m a Mazid?”
“No, I’m saying that if you were a Mazid, you wouldn’t be trying to convince me that there’s no such thing as Shis.”
“I simply find it suspect that human explanations for the structure of the universe always centers the human condition. The truth is that while you think the afterlife needs to be a world of woe deep underneath the earth, Solraheen might not have felt the same way.”
“But He does feel the same way. He created us humans from His Spark, so we think and feel like Him.”
“Humans created me, and yet I am nothing at all like you.”
“You look enough like a human to pass for one—if you put on some clothes.”
“A moth passes for a leaf, does that make it like a leaf? Or is there something fundamentally different about its nature?”
Mandri hated it when people used metaphors to make a point. Just because one thing roughly maps onto another doesn’t mean that there’s any truth in it. All it does is pull the argument out into murky water where it's drowned in things that don't matter. And Mandri was about to tell Obo as much when he was interrupted by the sound of a muffled argument breaking out from behind the wall.
Mandri scooted towards the crack to get a better listen. He couldn’t make out the words. 
He asked Obo, “What are they arguing about?”
Obo cocked his ear towards the crack. After a brief moment, he said, “Evidently our guard wasn’t supposed to leave us alone. His defense is that this little cave of ours smells.”
“He’d be right,” said Mandri, casting an accusing eye at Obo.
“I’m sorry about that,” said Obo. “There’s nothing I can do. But we should probably stop talking.”
“Why?”
“Because I am going to pretend to be asleep. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t give my ruse away.”
With that, Obo laid back down and assumed the exact position he’d been in when Mandri first saw him. As soon as Obo closed his eyes Mandri heard the sound of stone sliding against stone. The grinding sounded out, the door opened, torchlight flooded in, and not long after a short and stout Jandri man bumbled into the cave, hunched over, the flame of his torch licking the ceiling. Behind him came another man, skinnier, more Hrkan-like, but just as ragged all the same.
When the stout man saw Mandri sitting up, staring at him, he nearly dropped his torch.
“The boy’s awake!” he shouted. “I told you that could happen!”
He slapped the skinny man in the back of the head, who then said, “Don’t tell Ayram.”
“Oh, I’m telling Ayram.”
“Why? Nothin’s happened! Look at ‘im! He’s barely moved.”
The stout man with the torch turned his attention to Obo, who was feigning a pitiful, fitful sleep.
“Fine,” the stout man said. “I won’t tell. But you’ve got to carry the Mazid.”
“Fine by me. Barely weighs more than a pinch of tinder anyway.”
The skinny man stomped over to where Obo lay and made a fuss about how there wasn’t enough room to maneuver.
Mandri asked the stout man, “Is that really a Mazid?”
The man held the torch near to Mandri’s face, stinging Mandri’s nose with its heat.
“You don’t talk,” he said. The whole left side of his face was all scarred up and his beard was a scraggly patch of ugly fuzz. His breath was somehow fouler than the stench of the room.
Mandri asked, “Who are you?”
“Nope!” the stout man shouted. He followed it up with a sterner, firmer, “Nope!”
The skinny man leaned into the light and said to Mandri, “If you flap them lips again, I’ll clip ‘em.”
The stout man nodded in agreement.
“That’s how it is now,” he said. “You’re with the Ayramun, and with us, if you break the rules, you get broken. And the rule for you is, you nod or shake your head—that’s all you do, nod or shake. You understand?”
Mandri nodded.
The skinny man spat a wad of unspeakable phlegm right onto Mandri’s knee. The man chuckled to himself, then said to Mandri, “What were you doin’ out in that ravine, anyways?”
Mandri did not know how to answer the question by only moving his head. He didn’t think he’d be able to answer it with words. He had no idea what the man was talking about.
The skinny man laughed. 
“He’s like a rat in a bucket.”
“You will be too if we don’t hurry up,” said the stouter fellow.
“Yeah, yeah.”
The skinny man pulled Mazidobo’s limp weight up onto his shoulders and he ferried the Mazid out into the darkness. The stout man pulled Mandri up by the collar of his tunic and forced him to follow behind the skinny man. As Mandri left the cave, he caught a glimmer of Obo’s cheek and he swore he saw the Mazid wink. Mandri couldn’t help but smile.</Text>

STEAL FROM MINTING ROCK

            <Title>Burgeon Theft</Title>
            <Text>Mandri tried on three separate occasions to finagle some burgeons out of Seb. He was denied each time, and each time Seb grew angrier.. He got so mad that he threatened to kill Mandri, and when that didn’t work, he threatened to kill the burgeons. Mandri didn’t believe him, but that night Seb pulled out one of those beautiful eyes and he threw it into the dark as far as he could.
From that point on, Mandri reduced himself to suggestions and hints. When that didn’t work, he looked for opportunities to steal.
That night Mandri tried to steal Seb’s burgeons as the man slept. The only problem with his plan was that Seb wasn’t actually sleeping. Mandri ended up with Seb’s knife on his throat, and Seb pushed so hard that Mandri choked. The blade must have been blunt. After this incident, Mandri did not try to steal the burgeons again.</Text>

            <Title>Ugmukheen</Title>
            <Text>Mandri moaned as his sleep-crusted eyes split open and discovered a dark room. He lay quietly, regretting his reinsertion into the causal flow of reality.
The God’s Eye burgeon had been that good.
He didn’t remember any of it, but he remembered it was good.
When his eyes adjusted to the dimness, he discovered that he had, somehow, been brought back up to the temple’s ladder room. It was empty, save for him. The tumble of coals were still there, and the Ayramun’s packs were still there, so he hadn’t been left behind. He decided to climb the ladder and see if anyone was lounging around outside. He hoped someone was up there preparing a meal. The passing of the God’s Eye burgeon had left him hungry.
He climbed up the ladder’s rungs and as he moved the soreness in his body worked itself out quickly.
That must have been the work of the God’s Eye burgeon, too.
He decided to ask Seb about it as soon as he got the chance, but that would be all he would ask—he would have to pretend to remember everything that had happened down in that cave, including walking back himself, because he didn’t want to give Seb the impression that he couldn’t handle a single sliver of that beautiful burgeon.
Mandri pulled himself up onto the cobbled black stone of the tiny desert temple floor. He kept calling it a temple, but there was no altar or kneeling stone—only that hole in the ground and the wooden ladder. There was a scrawl of Old Jandri script circumscribing the inner dome, but Mandri couldn’t read it. He guessed it told of the life of some dead desert father who’d died here and was buried in a crypt somewhere down below. He shuddered at the thought of a life wasted in service to a long dead god.
He stepped out into the cool air and was surprised to find it was evening. He’d slept through the day, and soon, he assumed, they would be moving again.
All of the Ayramun were gathered to the right, at the top of the nearest hill. They stood with backs turned, facing west, facing the setting sun. They were a remarkable set of outland pokes, all different sizes, and with Obo included, still strapped in his litter and leaning against Ayram’s leg, they ranged from the smallest person alive to the largest. Only Seb, at the end of the line, turned and regarded Mandri’s presence. This he did with a smirk and a wink, and Mandri felt compelled to return the courtesy. 
Mandri scrambled up the hill to join him, and as soon as he arrived all schemes of stealing Seb’s God’s Eye burgeons fled from thought, for it was not the setting sun which stretched out above the horizon, but a heavy black cloud as dark as the oncoming night. And it was more than a cloud. It was the Lord of clouds for it stretched out across the world and churned it over. It could have been mistaken for a rampaging herd of mountains, if such a thing were possible. And though it was dark, Mandri was struck by its color, for its upper reaches pierced the shadow of the world's edge to catch the fleeing light day—at the top, a tip of gold, shading into red, oozing into pink, then a wall of reddish-black cloud all the way to the desert floor.
The sense of magnificence was helped along by little westwind zephyrs tickling Mandri’s skin. So far as he could tell, this storm was coming straight for them. 
“Holy shit,” he muttered.
“Nothin’ holy about it,” Seb croaked. He was standing next to Mandri, arms crossed, and for once he wasn’t chewing a spine—it hung there on his lip, forgotten. “Big ‘ol bastard, ain’t it?”
This storm was much bigger than that. It was an Ugmukheen, a child of Mukh, inheritor of His wrath. To Mandri’s knowledge, the Sand hadn’t seen a storm anywhere near this size for at least three hundred years, for that’s when Muk had perished.
Obo was as taken by the sight of the storm as everyone else.
“It is unnatural,” he said in wonder. This was the most honest emotion Obo had uttered since Mandri knew him.
“Of course it’s natural,” Seb said. “Everything that happens is natural.”
“It’s coming from an impossible direction,” said Obo.
Moto peaked around Ayram’s figure so that he could sneer at the Mazid as he said, “What would you know about the Ugmukheen?”
Obo countered by saying, “I’ve read every book and scroll that counts the weather in this part of the world, and every Ugmukheen for the past thousand years was born abreast the Gongee Sea.”
“So?”
“When the high Gongee winds stop blowing—it’s like taking the lid off a pot of steaming water. That’s how they’re made. And the Gongee Sea is four days to the south, not west. That’s not to mention that an Ugmukheen does not look like that.”
Moto was unimpressed. “Clearly, they do look like that.”
“Have you ever been caught in a Ugmukheen?” Obo asked him.
“No. Have you?”
“No.”
“The Mazid’s right,” said Ayram. “A true Ugmukheen is a thing you don’t see coming. The first you know of it is when your own dust overtakes you. You can survive an Ugmukheen. You can not survive a thing like that.” He pointed to the distant storm with his iron spear and said, “A storm like that would flay the toughest hide. That’s no Ugmukheen.”
Elrahet, who’d been brooding under her hood, said, “This must be Pell. Her and no one else. Every god who could have brought such a storm upon the world is long dead.”
Seb said, “We can’t walk the Sand with that monster runnin’ us down.”
Elrahet nodded and said, “We stay in the hole. And we pray to all that is holy that these hills don’t eat us.”
“But what about the Hrks,” Moto whined. “If we don’t keep moving, the Hrks will catch us long before we reach Bullr.”
Seb said, “There’s got to be another way.”
“We could try for the Kari plain,” said Moteah.
Ayram shook his head and stroked his beard. “Not the Kari.”
“Could try the Goree Pass,” said Seb.
“The Goree Pass…” Ayram repeated as his fingers twirled his beard tips.
“The Goree will never work,” said Moto.
“Why not?” Seb asked.
“Because the Goree Pass is cursed. It’s as cursed as that damned storm.”
“Not cursed enough for the Greskalun to live there,” Seb replied.
“But its not just the curse. Those damned Rigas will be at the Goree Pass long before we get there.” 
“If this storm curves north once it passes, then it’ll get in their way and give us room.”
“And what if it doesn’t curve north?”
Ayram answered for Seb and said, “Then I’ll have to think of something else. But I like the Goree Pass. Greskal could help us. The man hates Hrk as much as anyone.”
Every time Ayram pulled at his beard and twirled out a tuft of hair, the hair sprang right back into that smooth, bread-loaf shape. Mandri grew a little jealous, because he’d always wanted a nice full beard but his chin wasn’t up to it.
“That’s what we’re doing,” Ayram finally declared. “We wait out the storm, then head for the Goree.”
With that, he picked Obo’s litter up, then turned and side-step shuffled back down the hill. Moto stamped after him to fret about this change of plans. Of the rest of the Ayramun, Moteah seemed most unaffected. She was standing on a black rock which put her up a foot higher than the rest. She had a long reedy stick which she’d brought with her from the western plain below, and with it she drew little abstract faces, and then she’d watch the wind brush them away grain by grain.
Seb was watching the storm looking pleased with himself.
“Well,” Mandri said suggestively, “We suddenly find ourselves in possession of some recreational time.”
Seb patted his pocket and what-do-you-know, he nodded and wandered back down the hill.
Mandri couldn’t follow too quickly as he’d arouse too much suspicion. Someone would ask why he wanted to waste the day with Seb.
When he’d waited long enough he said, “Well, I’ll just, uh…I’ll go find something to eat.”
He scrambled down the hill to go find Seb and burgeons.
Unfortunately, Moto found him first. The man was climbing up the temple ladder just as Mandri was about to climb down, and when Moto was up and out he blocked Mandri’s way with his sword’s scabbard.
“Where are you going?” he asked.
“To find a snack.”
“No free food until you show me you can earn your keep.”
In his other hand was a Hrkan short sword in a tawny scabbard that he’d salvaged from the battle of Minting Rock. He extended this out towards Mandri, hilt first, clearly expecting Mandri to take it.
“I can’t imagine what you’d want me to do with this,” Mandri said. “Need me to dig out a big splinter or something?”
Moto was not amused. “Do you remember our conversation?”
“Nope,” said Mandri, biting his tongue.
“I was going easy on you then. Now that you’re out here with us, I’ll be harder. Take the goddamned sword.”
Mandri hesitated, but the man was serious, so he grabbed the sword and followed Moto back outside. The burgeons would have to wait.
Obo was outside as well, propped against the temple’s wall. When Moto noticed him, he said, “You could learn something too and pass it on to your Hrkan Lords. Their Skulsi are shitty fighters.”
“Yes, I heard how you and Ayram cut them down.”
“They’re brave, I’ll give them that.”
“Too brave,” said Obo.
“You’d rather they were cowards?”
Obo looked so strange, swaddled up like he was, like an overgrown baby, nine months old with the face of an ageless eunuch. Stranger still to see him adopt the air of a lecturer and say, “In the Hrkan art of war, there’s no such thing as cowardice. There’s no such thing as bravery, either, for bravery and cowardice are both symptoms of unpreparedness. There is only preparedness, and unpreparedness. If a soldier is ever called on to be brave or a coward, then his commander has failed him.”
“Of all the shadows from Shis,” Moto muttered. “What are you talking about?”
Obo continued on, as if reciting some long-remembered scriptural writ, “ Either the fighting man is fully prepared for what he faces and he is victorious, or his commander has failed and he must kill himself.”
Moto ambled several paces away and he drew his gold-trimmed sword with a flourish. “You can be as prepared as you can possibly be, but still face bad odds. That’s what calls for bravery.”
“If a commander’s soldiers face unbalanced odds, then the commander has failed in his maneuvers and his men have arrived to battle unprepared. Such a commander should kill himself—these are not my words, they are Lord Kashkan’s.”
“Alright, lesson number one, Mandri—don’t ever listen to a Hrk.”
“I already don’t,” said Mandri.
“Lesson number two—always run away from a fight if you can.”
Mandri dropped his sword in the dirt. Obo caught on and declared, “He’s a prodigy.”

“Can I first ask why we’re doing this?”
“No.”
“I’ll do whatever I can to help you guys out, but me swinging a sword isn’t it. I’m more likely to hurt myself than a Hrk.”
“We’re doing simple stuff here, Mandri, believe me, I know you can’t handle too much, so I’m giving you what you can handle. So answer my question. Or should we I go find another lizard pit?”
“Okay, I’ll play,” Mandri said as he picked up his sword.
“Now answer my question.”
“I forgot what it was.”
Obo chuckled, and Moto clicked his teeth in annoyance.
He said, “If you’re in a fight, what are you trying to do?”
“Survive.”
“Be more specific.”
“Run away.”
“Alright, fine, running away is good.”
“Okay, this is ridiculous—what are we doing here?”
Moto was almost at his wits end already. When he’d first drawn his sword, his shoulders were eager, now they were struggling to care. But his mouth was still going.
“In the event that you can’t run away, what is another specific goal you can set out for yourself?”
“Kill my enemy before he kills me.”
//
“If you live long enough you may learn something about the art of killing.”
“There’s nothing artful about killing,” said Obo. “I’ve seen enough to know.”
“You wouldn’t judge the entire art of painting from a child’s scribblings, would you? You’ve only ever seen a child’s scribblings.”
Mandri added, “You think you’re an artist?”
Moto replied. “All artists are trying to get at the human heart, I simply take the most direct approach. The only difference is that the best artist is a matter of opinion, but the best swordsman—that’s a matter of fact.”
Moto was too full of himself, so Mandri decided to prick his skin and ask, “Then who is the best swordsman? You?”
“I might be.”
“Who would win in a fight, you or Ayram?”
The answer was obvious, but Moto was taking a little too long to answer. He rubbed his head in frustration, as if the question was one of those utterances that made semantic sense but signified nothing, a stumbling block for would-be philosophers.
“That depends on too many things,” Moto said. “There’s not enough context.”
“The context is you versus Ayram.”
Moto eyed his blade and his face went through such a series of contortions that he could have charged money to see the act. Somewhere in there was the suggestion that it was offensive to even ask the question. He went through a few different shades of disappointment as well, like he was upset with himself for letting things stray too far away from the lesson at hand, and upset at Mandri for even existing. In the end, frustration won out and he said, “You know what? We’re done here. If you don’t want help staying alive,  you won’t get it.”
Moto stomped past and fled into the temple. Before his head disappeared down the ladder, he paused and said bitterly, “Keep the sword.”
Mandri and Obo shared impish smiles, though Obo was a little more practical. “We should probably head down as well.”
“Why?”
“The storm.”
“Oh.”
Mandri sheathed his sword and tucked in into his waistband. He then hauled Obo into the temple and down the ladder. Once down, he wandered off to find Seb, but the idiot had gone to sleep. Instead of enjoying a mind-splitting burgeon, Mandri waited in boredom with the rest of the Ayramun.
It did not take long for the storm to overtake them.
First came its shadow as the storm blocked out the rising sun, leaving the air outside suffused with a dim orange glow. Then came the soothing sound of wind-whipped sand splashing against the temple’s bricks above. Every now and then a gust of wind would blow into the temple entrance and swirl around inside, and if this wind was strong enough, it blew through the hole in floor, turning the ladder room and the tunnel beyond into a sort of flute—the faint whimpering whine sounded startlingly similar to the birthing fits of the brown mutts back in Meskalim.
As the wind intensified, this whine steadied into a droll hum, a sound so annoying that all the Ayramun retreated deep into the tunnel behind the ladder. Only Mandrameen and Obo stayed in the ladder room. Obo was there because no one could be bothered to pick him up and move him. Mandri stayed because he was mesmerized by the sight and sound of the storm outside. Being near to a monstrous, blossoming power was intoxicating.
“You know, I can kind of see why they want to free Solraheen,” he said as the air outside grew dark. “If He could make this storm, then just imagine the kind of power He has.”
“Solraheen didn’t make this storm,” said Obo. “As I’m sure you are aware, He is incapacitated at the moment.”
“He might not have made this particular storm, but He made…you know…He made the structure for it. He made the world that made it.”
“How profound,” said Obo, sarcastically.
“It’s not profound to say He’s the only true creator. A painter moves paint around, but that’s not real creation. Solraheen, he created the wind, he created the Sand from nothing. That kind of creativity is the only thing that makes life worth living.” 
Mandri was feeling philosophical, and he settled into a cozy mood. All that was missing was some burgeon beer to complete it. A nice freeweed wrap would do as well, but he didn’t usually go in for those. The warm dimness and the humbling immensity of the storm outside was working wonders on his stress. Satisfying, too, was the knowledge that he didn’t have to do damned thing, at least not for a good long while.
He asked Obo, “Do you have any beliefs? Does a Mazid believe anything?”
“What do you mean?”
“Eh, nevermind. Forget I asked. I’m just happy you’re here with me.”
“I’m touched,” said Obo, delighted. “And I should say the same. Without you it’d just be me amongst these Ayramun, and that would be horrific.”
“Have you thought at all about how to escape?”
“I don’t want to escape.”
“Why not?”
“I’ve thought about it, and where would I go? Back to Hrk? Never. These people, rough as they are, they’re my only chance at freedom. Do you know any other witches with knowledge of the Spark? I haven’t been alive long, but I’ve been looking for someone like Elrahet my whole life.”
“Wait, how old are you?”
“I am seven years old.”
“Seven!? Damn. I thought you were going to say like five-hundred. But really, seven? I bet it’s been a shitty seven years, too.”
“It has.”
“Well, you know what, Obo? If you stay, I’ll stay. Sol knows I’ve got nowhere else to be. You know, you deserve a Spark more than I do. I’d give you mine if I could, but I can’t exactly help you with that. You have my moral support.”
The two of them sat in contemplated silence for half a hand, when Obo ruined it by saying, half in jest but entirely serious,“Is this what friendship feels like?”
“Obo,” Mandri sighed. “You don’t say something like that out loud. You just feel it. Dwell in it.”
“I’m sorry, I haven’t done this before.”
“I can tell. Now stop talking about it. When you talk about it, you make it boring.”
“It’s not boring to me.”
“Look, when people start talking about their emotions and stuff, I have this physical reaction to it, and it’s annoying, so stop.”
“How so?”
“My legs get hot.”
“Your legs get hot?”
“Yes, that’s what I said. Now shut up about it.”
Mandri got up and fashioned some pillows out of what packs had been left in the room. He gave a quick look for Seb’s pack, because a drop of God’s Eye would significantly improve the moment, but of course Seb had expected this and brought his pack along with him. Mandri was forced, against his will, to lay there sober and watch the hole in the ceiling as the storm’s rage continued to build.
Hand after hand passed like this, and all the while the winds outside were rising. His thoughts turned to children’s stories, the ones that warned about the Ugmukheen. They came with instructions—hide the women, for as it passes it may fill their wombs. Beware the cough that can kill as vast quantities of sand are unavoidably inhaled. Have water, for it will strip the air of moisture, and its heat will sear the lungs. Mandri felt all these things coming on, except of course, the pregnancy. But the one thing he hadn’t seen was the snap and crack of lightning leaping from every surface. The stories were clear on that—the air should come alive with little lightnings. 
Soon, the heat increased until the air was as hot as an oven. Mandri moved to flap his arms to air out his sweaty pits, and the motion conjured up a shocking spark.
He yelped in surprise.
“Your hair looks ridiculous,” said Obo.
Mandri reached up and half the hairs on his head were standing on end. His excitement at this electric thrill was tempered by the sound of rock sliding atop rock.
It was coming from the temple above.
“The wind is lifting the dome,” said Obo, with a hint of worry.
“Should we be in here?”
“I would say that we should be fine, but, you never know.”
Mandri repositioned his makeshift cot as far away from the hole as room allowed, shocking himself several times as he did. Before he was finished, an especially loud howl of wind kicked a gout of sizzling sand into the temple above, and it was followed by a splitting shock of thunder.
CRACKABOOOM
All Mandri saw was a flash of white light and then, suddenly, blackness. The temple above had caved in on itself, and the circle in the ceiling disappeared.
Mandri  shuffled back against the wall for he could hear a torrent of Sand pouring down into the room, and soon he felt it licking at his ankles. His great fear of being buried alive was short-lived, for soon the hole above was plugged by a glut of bricks.
“Well...that’s not good,” he said as one last wisp of sand puffed down—the sad, dying breath of another Old Jandri relic. </Text>

            <Title>Synopsis</Title>
            <Text>The story begins at rich estate run by a man named Vigram. Mandrameen, called Mandri, is there to teach Vigram how to paint. Vigram is there to try and set Mandri up with his daughter, for Mandri is a prodigious talent and such a match would buy Vigram great esteem. Vigram’s daughter is comely, but Mandri rejects the match because he is more concerned with getting high and wasting his life away on his barren, salt-stained farm.

Mandri retreats to his farm and gets drunk on spiked-up burgeon beer. As he lazes the day away with his pet ox, he is approached by a strange old woman named Pel. Mandri tries to shoo Pel away, but she is persistent. She wants to know if Mandri might serve her god by playing a role in prophecy. Mandri wants nothing to do with it, but she wants everything to do with him. And she’s hungry. She kills Mandri’s ox, eats its divine Spark, and she threatens Mandri with the same if he doesn’t go into Meskalim and see its governor, a man Salavan Soreen.

Mandri stumbles into the slum-city of Meskalim and finds Salavan’s mansion. Salavan invites Mandri inside, brings him down into the basement, where he compels Mandri to paint a picture using only pigments made from Fabled Black. Mandri does so under the watchful eye of a dead body which Salavan keeps in the room for motivation. The black portrait that Mandri paints transports him to a void where a dripping black head begins to emerge from the canvas. Mandri recognizes the being is Schisol, an evil god. Mandri shrieks, and he is pulled out this nightmare and back into Salavan’s basement, where Salavan stands amazed at what Mandri has seen. Salavan tells Mandri how delighted he is as he leaps for Mandri’s neck and chokes him dead.

The story transitions to the foothills of the Hias mountains, where a dirty bandit named Seb finds Mandri’s body under a bush. This is an ill omen, and Seb carries the body to a witch named Elrahet. She is not too concerned about it, and declares that is not enough for their bandit troop, called the Ayramun, to cancel their ambush. Their target is a fleshcrafted being who can shoot a beam of fire out its mouth, called a Mazid. The Ayramun’s ambush is successful and they capture the Mazid, but not before the Mazid slaughters a great number of the Ayramun.
 
The story transitions back to Mandri, who wakes up in a cave and believes he his dead and that he has entered into the underworld, called Shis. In the cave with him is the captured Mazid, named Obo, who Mandri believes is a demon. Obo eventually convinces Mandri that he is not actually dead, that he is somewhere out in the Sand’s Pitted Portion, and that he is a captive of an outland troop who call themselves the Ayramun. Mandri and Obo are dragged out into a larger pit cave, where the Ayramun’s leader, a giant named Ayram, calls forth a girl, named Purl, to step forth to try and exercise her newfound power as Obo’s Minder, for the Mazid cannot wield his flame on his own accord, it is called forth by a Mazid’s Minder. Purl tries to wield Obo as a weapon, but she fails. The old witch Elrahet says Purl needs time to recover from an injury, and Ayram reluctantly accepts this excuse.

Ayram leads his band out into the Sand, to a hideout called Minting Rock. There it is discovered that Obo can be tracked from anywhere in the world by a different fleshcrafted creature, called a Mazidariga. At that moment, a Mazidariga arrives at Minting Rock with a column of soldiers. A great battle takes place, and Minting Rock is destroyed, but the Ayramun prevail. Unfortunately, Obo had his pseudo-Spark sucked out of his body by the Mazidariga and he has gone limp. Fortunately, the Ayramun captured the Mazidariga, and the witch Elrahet was able to return Obo’s pseudo-Spark into his body. Obo awakens, and the surviving Ayramun fret about what to do, as they cannot hide from the armies of Hrk if Obo can be so easily tracked. They decide that they’re going to have to capture another Mazidariga. Ayram’s plan is to have the captured Mazidariga draw Obo’s Spark from his body a second time and leave it that way, thus rendering Obo untraceable. When they need Obo to do what they need him to do, they will simply put his pseudo-Spark right back.

Here it is revealed that Ayram’s goal is to destroy the power of the Hrkan Lords by smuggling Obo into the caverns under the Hrkan capital and have him kill the god of creation, named Solraheen. Obo states that he will go along with this plan willingly—no need for a Minder to force the fire out of his mouth, but he’ll only do it if the Ayramun give him something in return. He wants his own bright and willful Spark, because for him it means freedom. He believes that Elrahet can give it to him, just as Elrahet had revived Mandri with a Spark. However, Elrahet does not trust Obo, and she denies his request—they’ll make do with Ayram’s plan.

The Ayramun flee across the Sand. They rest at an small and empty desert temple, where Seb guides Mandri down a ladder and into the temple’s depths, tempting Mandri along with the promise of burgeons. The pair settle down in a small room, where Seb gives Mandri a sliver of a God’s Eye burgeon. The effect of this burgeon is so strong that it sends Mandri into a catatonic state. When this is done, the demon witch named Pel—the witch who had killed Mandri’s ox and set the story in motion—emerges from the dark. Seb is revealed to be her servant, a traitor to the Ayramun. Pel wishes to see the Ayramun fail, and upon hearing Seb’s account of their capture of the Mazid, she conjures a sandstorm to force the Ayramun to head for the Goree Pass, where her minions await.

Ayram takes the bait—he leads his band to the Goree Pass, where he expects to find a friendly tribe, called the Greskalun. But the Pass is abandoned, and worse, there are signs of an infestation of demons. Soon, the Ayramun are set upon by another Mazidariga who heads a column of soldiers. But this Mazidariga is more patient than the first—it had seen the carnage of the battle at Minting Rock and wishes to treat with Obo, for it believes the Mazid is in charge. Ayram takes advantage of the Mazidariga’s ignorance and pretends to act as Obo’s emissary. He claims that he will betray Obo for a cash reward. When the exchange is made, Ayram outwits and outmuscles the Mazidariga, for just as the Mazidariga swallows Obo’s Spark, Ayram kills it, and he his kin flee with the Mazidariga’s corpse into the Goree Pass. Ayram feels that they have won, as they effectively removed the tracker from Obo’s body, and they can march unmolested straight to Jeket to carry out their act of deicide.

But the Hrkan soldiers are close on their heels. They chase the Ayramun into a massive mountain temple. After the Ayramun get lost in the Temple’s bowels, they stumble upon a great abomination—an immobile blob the size of a house and called the Amalgamete. This demon king births other frightful demons to do its bidding, and the Ayramun are attacked. A frenzied battle takes place. The Ayramun achieve a pyrrhic victory, for though the Amalgamete is dead, the Mazidariga’s body was destroyed, losing Obo’s psuedo-Spark forever. Ayram himself is killed, his body too mangled to bring back. 

Elrahet, desperate for a way to continue her quest, decides to grant Obo his wish. She fashions a Spark from the Amalgamete’s stomach, and Obo is born anew. He is now in complete in control of his own body, a god-like weapon set free. Elrahet tries to convince him to help her cause in killing Solraheen. When Obo does not agree, Elrahet decides that the only way to convert him is to bring him down to the underworld and show him first-hand why killing Solraheen is necessary.

Elrahet leads what’s left of the Ayramun down in the depths of the earth, straight to the doors of Shis. There, she makes a fire and tells them the story of the world. It is revealed that the evil god Schisol and the good god Solraheen are of the same flesh, one body and two minds, though only one mind present at any given time. While Solraheen wishes to preserve life, Schisol wishes to destroy it so that every living Spark can be reunited into a single whole—and that includes the Obo. Then the doors of Shis open, and the evil witch Pel steps forth. Pel and Elrahet trade barbs, for they are the most ancient of enemies, and Pel confirms to the Obo that she will stop at nothing to end him. Obo, the demigod, picks a side—he tries to kill Pel with his Mazidfire. But the evil witch disappears into a puff of smoke, and as she does, the doors of Shis open wider to reveal a demonic horde.

Thus ends the first part of the novel.</Text>

            <Title>Ch25 - Scratch</Title>
            <Text>There is a map of Shis hanging on the second floor of the eastern wing of the Great Library of Jeket. It is an enormous map, roughly two-men long and one-and-a-half tall, and as a child, Mandri studied every scratch of washed-out ink on that stitched-together ribbon of bleached lizard skin, which taken together look like an stiff puddle of curdled milk suffused with fungus. It occupied such a privileged position in Mandri’s imagination because the map wasn’t merely lines and labels, it was crawling with drawings of demons. Men with chicken heads and chicken feet breathed fire at the margins, chickens with lizard arms and phallic extrusions flopping on their backs pecked at little stick figures that represented humans. He studied that map more than any master-work, so much so that the names of places were firmly fixed in his memory—Shusa, “The Plain of Woe”. Kikarukabam, “Where adulterers are split”. Zuudramu, “The Pits of Apostasy”.
This map was made in the Old Jandri age by a priest of the name Batata. The story goes that Batata had set out into the Sand to discover which way the fabled Shurka river flowed. No one knew precisely where the river was—somewhere east—Batata found it and settled the issue, he said it flowed west. Few believed him because he also claimed to have discovered the location of another fabled place—the golden city of Kurbakee. There was a rich reward for discovering the way to Kurbakee, and Batata tried to claim it. When he was refused, and his directions were doubted, he convinced a royal map-maker to set out with him into the Sand and officially chart the way. Only Batata returned, some years later, carrying with him a map of Shis.
The scribal consensus was that this map of Shis was a crude money making maneuver, and it worked, as some gullible merchant prince did eventually purchase it. The minority opinion claimed that the map was a spiritual scare tactic designed by Batata to further Solraheen’s kingdom. Scare tactics were common to scribes and priests in every age because virtue without terror is impotent. People have got to be scared of divine retribution, or else they’ll loosen their lips, loosen their hips, and start stabbing at anything that walks.
Both of these were workable explanations, but Mandri disagreed with them. He thought there was too much effort on display for it all to be a cynical lie. Because that map of Shis wasn’t the only the map that Batata made. Some of the others outlined Jandri’s true shape, and one of these was the first to correctly place, more or less, each of the Sand’s eight portions. If he were correct about that, then what about those small dots that void the Sand like baby spiders, each with a postscript saying, Shiskason, or, “Entrance into Shis.”
These dots were so far out into the desert that no rational person would try and verify their existence. Batata himself said that these dots were only approximations, and that he had only stumbled onto these pits in the earth by pure happenstance—as they’re not things that can be seen from a distance.
There is one moth-eaten scroll where Batata accounts his descent into one of these ‘gashes’. This descent is where he gained the knowledge of Shis’s outlay. It is a poetic work, without much poetic value, and it was written in a mind-numbing meter which could put the most Spark-bitten child to sleep. Half its lines were eaten away by bugs, and half of the rest didn’t need to be written at all, and yet, there was one refrain that stuck with Mandrameen throughout the years.
Batata recounted how he’d been stumbling through the pitch black, torch in hand, when he came upon a relatively unassuming stone door frame. It was three simple grey-stone blocks, tall and narrow, with perfectly plumb and squared beams. Engraved into these pillars was an ancient verse. It rhymes in Old Jandri, but written out in common, it reads:
Some claimed that Batata invented this verse out of whole cloth. Others took it up as a righteous creed that preached detachment from the world, and so they impressed the lines into their heads through blunt repetition. Batata himself claimed that it was a set of dark commandments, literal commandments that he named Schisol’s creed, and he claimed that they must be obeyed if one were to pass under this threshold and move into the realm of Shis. The last line was especially grim, for according to Batata it implied that if the living wished to cross into that dark realm, they must bring along a ritual sacrifice. In exchange, Schisol’s servants would grant the ritualist immortality, and thus, he or she would never be called to Shis again.</Text>

            <Title>Mandean</Title>
            <Text>Hi OP,
I'm a Mandaen myself and the other commentors aren't very far off, but let me give you the perspective straight from the Mandaean's mouth. Jesus wasn't even evil by choice as we see it, but something in his teachings, by choice or not, perverted the sanctity of relgion as we see it. Religion was never meant to be an economic or political enterprise, and our belief in this goes back to our ancient relationship with the ancient Jews (we are very likely one of the &quot;Lost Tribes&quot; of Israel). As such, we disagreed with the idea of a &quot;holy land&quot; or &quot;chosen people&quot; and insisted that all conflicts can be solved with effective nonviolence. We are a matriarchal religion that puts an emphasis on respect for all life, while reconciling science and faith. We believe in evolution and a big-bang type event, even though we also believe in archons and deities that are in a larger &quot;congress&quot; of sorts, and that the god we believe in, Manda-ad-Hai or &quot;knowledge of life&quot; or &quot;The Great Life&quot; is but a being in control of this part of the universe. Manda means knowledge in Aramaic, therefore, Mandaean means &quot;People of Knowledge&quot;.
Since I mentioned that we started out alongside the Jews in the Jerusalem/Sinai/Jordan Valley area (with some wiggle room for a presence in Egypt, though unconfirmed), most likely branching off thousands of years ago but still living alongside one another. Then the Babylonians invaded in 597 BC, and many Jews and Mandaeans were taken as perhaps a combination of prisoners of war or just as intellectual/skilled citizens as part of the Kingdom of Babylon. That was the first wave, but not all of us had left. The second wave from Jerusalem to Babylon happened when the Judeo-Roman war happened in 66 AD. Most likely, Mandaeans fled because we did not want to fight and die over land (explicitly against our teachings) and went to where kin were, in Babylon. On the way, some ended up staying in the Harranian Peninsula of Syria, where evidence of Mandaean and Jewish communities have been found in context. We may have ventured as far as Yemen along with the Jews as well. And so, for more than 2,500 years or so, we have considered Babylon a home. How did we survive as a pacifist, baptist community? Well, socioeconomically we were artisans and scientists. We were a valued and influential member of society, education was paramount for us, and keeping traditions of peace alive were just as important.
We are also referenced in the Hebrew bible as the &quot;Nassorayim / nassoraeans&quot; (sp?), as a higher priestly class akin to, if not higher than the Levites and Cohens. Revered Semetic scholar Rudolf Macuch, a Jew himself, wanted to revive Hebrew in the late 19th century along with many of his peers at the time since it had been largely lost outside of the Middle East as a language. So, Macuch studied Mandaic (Eastern Aramaic, analogous to Talmudic Hebrew from Babylon) and filled in the gaps that had been lost in Hebrew (Western Aramaic from Jerusalem)...and incredibly, he created the first Mandaic dictionaries. We didn't even do this, because we don't write things down unless our existence is threatened, which is understandable. That's why scholars and historians alike may say there is no evidence for our existence before the Christian era, but we have in fact, but a very secretive group away from the spotlight for much, much longer than the time of Christ.
Here's where it gets even cooler: Christianity obviously mentions the followers of John. But we aren't his followers, we staunchly believe we are his direct descendants, and by relation of course, related to his cousin, Jesus of Nazareth. Our side of the story is that John was ever beheaded, he had kids and lived a peaceful life baptizing until the end of his days. Not only that, but when Jesus came to John to be baptized, John was worried, and a bit reluctant, but pitied Jesus and his eccentric ways enough to say &quot;sure&quot;. The rest as they say, is history.
Oh and this is important: why do Muslims consider us people of the book? Did they just take the Jews' and Christians' word for it? Maybe, but there is a story in the Hadith (newer volumes of the Qur'an added hundreds of years after the prophet Muhammad died, recognized by the Shiites but not by Sunni's as I understand it) That Mohammad went to the desert for 40 days (that old biblical trope) and met a people of higher knowledge who were protectors and keepers of God's original teachings, who wore, white and baptized in the fresh water rivers. So, he asked them if he could learn, and they of course said yes. If you see how Muslims pray, they wash their hands and hold them up, letting the water run down without touching anything else. Sound familiar? This is the sterile technique surgeons use. &quot;Nobody touch me I'm sterile!&quot; = &quot;Nobody touch me I'm spiritually clean&quot;.
We are the original baptists, and we founded the right of Mikveh in the river, before it went to the closed baths, perhaps with an inlet and outlet making it an extension of a nearby river, a method used by ancient Jews and modern Mandaeans alike, but Mandaeans still push for baptism in the river. By the way, the &quot;sacred living water&quot; is called Yardina in Mandaean..YRDN...JRDN...Jordan...The River Jordan. Awesome, huh? Water is one of the five supreme entities. We believe life evolved and propagfated from fresh water, living water, that most likely came from some extraterrestrial source of some kind. Maybe comets, maybe aliens, all we know is it came from the World of Light, somewhere in the Polar North in astronomical terms. We bury our dead with their heads pointing toward this region of the universe because we believe that is were all souls go, and were Manda-ad-Hai, the creator and arbiter of this world came from.
The whole point about being a Mandaean is to create peace and gather knowledge through the human experiences of faith and science. We believe that war, poverty and disease will always be the bane of mankind, and that we will meet our end that way, but we should never give up hope, since we can always find some measure of peace combating those destructive forces with peace, prosperity and health. This is why we baptize and keep an emphasis on a &quot;clean&quot; life, both physically and spiritually, in order to combat disease. We believe mourning creates mental illness and hatred, which is why we never mounred the loss of our home in Jerusalem, just as we tell ourselves not to mourn the loss of Iraq/Iran after well over 95% of us have left the region in the last 25 years. We are human beings, flawed as any others, we believe environment and upbringing shapes people, not their race or faith. This optimism in the inherent good is paramount in our lives so we can keep contributing positive things to the world. No politics. No army. No war. Mandaean teaching tells us to &quot;actively seek out injustice and oppose it with knowledge, not iron&quot;...meaning, we aren't some cliche pacifists that siolate ourselves in order to live peacefully, we actively engage with our communities and neighbors to create a greater peace for all. Our reputation is concentrated and very respected within the circles of Iraq and Iran, but without any political or military influence, we quietly went about our business without anyone seeing us as a threat. People trust us, revere our legacy and mourn our loss from the region. Today, we live in more than 36 countries around the world and want to rectify the opinion that religion is not a force for good but for ignorance, we believe that God gave us brains to use and help our fellow man.
Oh and women are paramount, because they are the center of families, therefore empowering women without being patriarchal is very important for understanding community health in a public health perspective. We are baptized with a religious name base don the time of day and year you are born and then the last part of the name is your mother's religious name. The final result of all these practices is a resilient, skilled, revered community of people who love humanity despite it's flaws because we understand that we must leave the world a better place than when we entered it. Simple. Be kind, gain knowledge and skills, and use them to create a secure and happy life of dignity for yourself, your family and as much of your community as you possibly can. Never neglect the world, because your soul won't be filled with good deeds. Sounds about as biblical as it gets...and yet...we have nothing to do with Abraham....PLOT TWIST! He was never one of us and we don't believe he was a prophet, mainly because he circumcised himself. If he just baptized and practiced self-cleaning like we did, he probably wouldn't have gotten that legendary STD which more moderate historians and religious experts believe to be the real reason he did the old snip-snip. But that's a story for another day. I've said enough...for now.</Text>

            <Title>Minting Rock</Title>
            <Text>Before the rise of the Hrks, the Watered Portion was ruled by an Old Jandri king named Duror. To prove his dominion, Duror placed interlocking blocks of granite two-by-two-by-ten at every bend of the Jek river. Out of these gray columns he carved his long-bearded, long-robed image. The first statue was built at the Jek’s source, high up in the Goree mountains overlooking the Shoglok falls. This statue is now sanded so smooth by the erosion of ages that no discernible feature of Duror remains. He is little more than a gray wither of stone in the general shape of a man, earless and eyeless, brooding as the sun and moon and stars spun endlessly overhead.
The Jek river descends down into the foothills where it is guarded by a spate of statued Durors that have also been sanded into smooth, pointed pillars—more like cattle scratch posts than a filigreed statue of a king. Their heads are reduced to conical nubs, their swords worn down to the hilt. The river then pours out of the foothills and down into the brink of Hrkan civilization. These Durors were somewhat shielded from the erosive wind, but they were not able to hide from the chisels of recriminate outland men. Further down the river and into the long and winding plain, Duror’s component blocks begin to disappear altogether, for the stones are stolen to reinforce pastoral walls. Then, further on, the river arrives at the outskirts of Jeket. All that is left of Duror’s monuments are the enormous plinths upon which they once stood, for they are too large for herdsmen to bother with.
Old Jandri statues are disintegrating the nearer they come to Jeket—there is a symbolism here, obvious, unsubtle, and pointed, and so of course people disagree about what it means. A Hrkan Lord would say that it is a sign of Hrk’s cleansing influence on the old world, while an outland poke thinks its a sign of Hrk’s corrupting influence. Outland folk yearn for that storied age when all peoples were rootless, when herds of oxen were free to be chased across the entire continent, when women wove blankets so long they could be wrapped around a village, when men were honest and would cut off their own fingers to prove that they were sorry.
Both sides, Hrkan and Outland, claim the statues of Duror as symbols of their own magnificence. Sometimes they kill over them. Mandrameen thought this was all a bunch of nonsense, and everyone involved was an idiot. The pivotal detail that no one cared to notice was that most of these statues were sitting alone out in an empty desert because the course of the river Jek had changed dramatically. The statues have nothing to do with Hrk and whether it was good or bad. Their message is that nothing lasts forever, and while Mandri was sure about everything, he was most sure about that.
Rivers change their course.
Rivers dry up.
Continents dry up.
Solraheen Himself was buried. 
Everything living dies.
Beauty fades.
Paintings brown up and curl.
Statues turn to dust.
Everything living dies—that’s worth mentioning twice.
Ideas are easy to kill—some might try and argue that one, but Mandri could easily slip into saying that ideas are easy to corrupt, and no one could argue that.
Innocence is famously easy to kill. In fact, it seems that the main function of innocence is to be killed.
Manhood is easy to kill because it doesn’t exist in the first place. Same with womanhood, adulthood, and any-hood. They’re all hoods foisted upon a child who never quite grows up. And children? Schisol knows children are easy to kill.
Minting Rock was another object to add to this collection of things consigned to oblivion. Its central sunlit well was drilled straight through the rock’s core and down a long ways into the earth. When Mandri looked up and saw a canted column of light shining down into the blackness of Minting Rock’s hollowed out interior, he was smitten with that daunting awe which only comes from contact with a soon-to-be-extinguished culture.
But it was impressive. He felt, without exaggeration, that he was standing inside a broken bead cast off from the necklace of some primordial mountain god. 
He grabbed the rope which hung down into the dark, and out of sight an Ayramun began to pull him up.
The first level of Minting Rock was a bulbous, cylindrical cocoon eight men tall. The sunlight above didn’t quite reach this room, so the scant light splayed throughout came from two flower-flame oil lamps affixed to either shoulder of a dark and narrow passage to Mandri’s left. With so little light, much of the room’s detail was lost to blackness, but what Mandri could see of it took his breath away.
The flat disc of a floor was embossed with a rotationally symmetric diamond pattern, and at the floor’s edges this pattern ran smoothly up onto the wall, flowing upwards and splitting into several ribbons of sculptural stone, a weave that criss-crossed in and out of itself, a stunning fantasy that coupled geometric intricacy with organic fluidity and pulse—all in stone. And it had dimension. The outer ribbon layers cast hard, shifting shadows on the ribbons underneath. It seemed as if the room were a cage keeping out a kaleidoscopic vision stolen from a burgeon binge and then brought to life. The topmost layer, the bars of this cage, graduated from a swirl of ribbon into into a prickling fence of barbed thorns, and like a climbing vine they spiraled all the way up the wall and converged towards the center of the ceiling, merging into the lashes of an oval eye whose iris was the open shaft which led ever upwards and into the light of day.
The room smelled like a urinal. An unseen hand grabbed a fistful of Mandri’s robe between his shoulder blades and yanked him off the rope. He was then plopped ass-first onto the richly patterned floor and the pain in his thigh reasserted itself.
The man who’d pulled him out was Seb, and the smell was coming from him.
“What is this place?” Mandri asked in whispered wonder.
“This be Minting Rock,” Seb said as his near-toothless mouth squelched a borcandi spine. He was obviously an old hand at borcandi biting because he carried himself with that borcandi bent—like his muscles were stuck in tension and had been that way for years, shoulders hunched and tight, head knocked forward, limbs all slightly bowed as if he’d half-coiled up in fright and rusted that way. 
“I don’t care about the name,” Mandri said. “What is this place? Who made it?”
Seb nudged Mandri’s hip with the toe of his shoe, and then he shooed Mandri up against the wall with a few flaps of his fingers.
“Keep out of the way,” he said.
Mandri scooted backwards against the wall and shoved his injured leg flush against it, so that nothing of him stuck out into the floor. 
The neck of Seb’s robe was yawning at Mandri’s nose, and the man’s odor was pouring out—he smelled like butter gone bad. He peered into Mandri’s eyes and said, “I can tell you a burgeon biter, ain’t ya?”
The man’s odor was nauseating. Mandri scrunched up his nose and simply replied, “You smell.”
Seb stood back up, then wilted. Even a hard-up outland man couldn’t abide being found out like that. A man’s face could be ugly as mud, that was the world’s fault—but his smell, his smell was coming from the inside and it said something about him without his meaning to. A bad smell is the one thing that could make the most loutish street-junk keeper feel shame. A bad smell is a secret every man’s got to keep.
“What’d I tell you about flappin’ them lips?”
Seb’s tired eyes managed to impress upon Mandri a great disappointment. Seb was a nobody amongst nobodies, as irrelevant as one of Jeket’s crawlers—men who beg from beggars. Mandri had a sense for these people even if they hadn’t yet fallen that far. There’s a dopiness about them, the face kind of sags. And they smell. To a man and woman, they smell.
Suddenly, a shrill whistle rang out from the oculus above. A heartbeat later, and Minting Rock was alive with the slapping patter of leatherbound feet. Muffled shouts reared out of unseen corridors. It was as if Minting Rock’s door had just been knocked and all the house mutts were flung into a muster. Hill came climbing up the well-shaft rope, his stout frame slinking up and up like a fat caterpillar, and without so much as a nod he disappeared into the chamber above.
There came, springing out of the passage to Mandri’s left, a clink of metal on stone. This thumping clink repeated again and again, in time with a walking stride, growing louder as it neared Mandri’s chamber. Mandri found himself trembling, and he was scooting away when Ayram stormed into the room, beard-jutting and wild-eyed. In his hand was his long iron spear, which barely cleared the passage ceiling. Its chisel end bit into the polished floor.
Moto followed him, and waddling in behind Moto was the short, old, black-ragged witch woman named Elrahet. She lingered in the passage mouth, under the flickering lamps, and her dark hood cast a long, hard shadow which hid her eyes from view. Mandri watched her as she watched Ayram. There was a familiarity to her profile that he couldn’t quite place.
She turned her whole hooded head towards Mandri, and his eyes fled in embarrassment. Though it was a mere glancing exchange her gaze stirred up his stomach. 
Ayram and Moto were standing in the opposite end of the room. Between them was a shadowy lump. Moto kicked it, and a dull crack sounded out. Moto steadied himself against the wall and was about to deliver another rough kick when Elrahet told him to stop.
“The Mazid is awake,” she said as if pressed for time.
Moto stepped back to let the light in, and there was Obo with his eyes open, blinking at the world around him like he’d just woken up into a dream.
Ayram had no sympathy.
“Tell me how you did it,” he growled.
Obo looked up at Ayram and regarded the giant with contempt. He said, voice hoarse, “What are you blaming me for now?”
Ayram did not reply. He didn’t need to. A man his size could simply stand still and glare, and that was intimidating enough to scare a reluctant tree into shaking off its fruit.
Obo pushed himself up into a sitting position, and his head drooped as if his neck were so weak it couldn’t bear the burden. Mandri thought Obo was playing too hard for sympathy here.
Obo said, “I know it can be difficult, sometimes, to draw a clear line between cause and effect, but blaming me for anything seems unsound.”
Ayram lifted his great spear and then let it slip down his fist and its wide chisel tip hit the stone floor right next to Obo’s hip.
Obo was unimpressed. “You’re the one that captured me and brought me here,” he said. “If I’ve caused you any trouble, then you’ve brought it upon yourself.”
Ayram remained silent. Mandri suspected the man was in the middle of realizing that Obo was incapable of feeling fear.
Obo said, “If I may take a moment to ask—what is it you plan to do with me? I’m a curious creature, I have to know.”
With a twist of his wrist, Ayram set the iron spike to rest against Obo’s collar bone. The weight of it almost tipped Obo over. Obo shrugged it off, and Ayram set it right back on the bone. 
Obo said, “Did you honestly believe that a Hrkan Lord would make a weapon as powerful as me without devising a way to track me down should I get loose?”
Moto blurted out, “They can track you down to anywhere?”
“Have you truly never heard of the Mazidariga?”
Mandri had never heard of the Mazidariga. Judging by the dumbfounded expression in Moto’s eyes, and the shrug in Ayram’s shoulders, neither man had heard of it either. Since none of them were willing to admit to not knowing something, an uneasy silence went unbroken until Elrahet grumbled aloud, “Riga means shadow.”
Moto bent down and began to examine Obo’s shadow for a sign of some obscure magic.
“Not my literal shadow,” Obo said with insulting disdain. “A Mazid’s shadow is a creature. They are grown alongside the Mazidai—their purpose is to hunt us down. You cannot hope to hide from the Hrks so long as you hold onto me.”
“Moto,” said Ayram.
“Yes?”
“Get the boys blooded up.”
“You’re going to fight them?” Obo asked in disbelief. “That’s very brave. I hope you don’t expect I’ll be much help.”
“Why not?”
“A Mazidariga can ensnare my psuedospark from afar.”
Neither man paid him any heed. Moto jumped onto the well-shaft rope and climbed out of sight, whilst Ayram turned to Seb, and Seb, anticipating a word from his leader, stepped forward.
Ayram said, “Take the boy and the Mazid up into an aspect.”
Seb bowed in deference as Ayram and Elrahet swept out of the chamber, back into the passage from whence they came. Ayram’s iron staff clinked against the stone as he went, though the sound was soon lost amongst the yip and din of a band of the hardest pokes preparing for battle.
Seb grabbed Mandri’s wrist and yanked him to his feet, and Mandri groaned as his leg screamed in pain. Seb then hurried over to Obo and made a fuss about wrapping up Obo’s wounds so that Mazid’s blood wouldn’t taint his person. Once Obo was swaddled up tight like a baby, arms tucked inside, Seb picked him up and carried him under-arm like a freshly-wrapped package of beef. He ran into the dark passage. Then he popped back out and motioned for Mandri to follow.
Mandri found it hard to follow Seb through the narrow, winding ways of Minting Rock. He limped along fiercely, steadying himself against the sculptured stone, but he couldn’t keep up.
“Hurry up!” Seb cried as he doubled back and took a hold of Mandri’s wrist. He pulled Mandri towards a sputtering lamp whose light flooded up a chubby set of curling stairs. Ascending these put an odd twist in Mandri’s mental map of the place, and it became difficult to maintain a sense of where he was within the rock. There was almost no light, and he was shoved through so many warped passages that all he knew for certain was that he was moving away from the center. Every new chamber and corridor became more cluttered and cramped, and the stonework less polished and more rough—the walls were still sculpted into an otherworldly weave but Mandri’s fingers could feel an inattention to thickness of edge. It was clumsy work, clumsy in comparison to what he’d seen in that central shaft. 
Mandri got to thinking, after bumping his head on an absurdly low door frame, that whoever had carved this rock had perhaps carved out too much of it. Unless Old Jandri tribesmen were as learned as Hrkan architects in the art of stressing stone, the whole thing was bound to fall apart. And the further out Mandri went, the more slapdash the passages and rooms became. By the time he saw a slit of blue sky though an embrasure, his toes and fingers were stumbling upon stress cracks in the floors and walls. Once, in this dusty dark, he bumped his shoulder against an unworked wooden beam that arched over his head. He swore he saw the floor above buckle and sag.
He was eventually pushed into a long and narrow room, long enough for him to lay down in, but barely enough room to turn around. This closet had access to outside air through a stippled pattern of finger-sized holes bored into the far wall. The sun didn’t shine directly through them, so these pinpricks of day sat on the black rock wall illuminating nothing, like a constellation of stars. They composed an Old Jandri pattern—a simple, eight-flamed sun, the traditional symbol of Solraheen.
Seb elbowed Mandri further into this shoulder-squeezing closet, and that’s when the room’s defining quality hit him—the air inside was thick with a foul smell, sweet and horrible, cloying, as if a mound of peaches had been left to putrefy in some dark corner. Mandri gagged, clutched at his nose, and when the spicy bitterness stung the back of his tongue like rancid burgeon bile he spat and choked.
He thought, at first, that this was some kind of prayer room and that the smell was incense put here to trigger his spiritual impulse. He didn’t entertain the thought that this scent was meant to mask a fouler smell until he reached out into the dark to steady himself, and instead of slapping against stone, his fingers sank into something that felt curiously like skin.
He yelped and recoiled.
He leaned back into the opposite wall where his other hand brushed up against a dried and bony limb.
He yelped again, and prayed fast that Solraheen would adjust his eyes to the darkness. He’d have pulled his own Spark out to see.
Seb slapped the back of his head. “Keep your hands to yourself.”
“What’s in here?”
“Don’t worry about it.”
Seb pushed Mandri towards the stipple-pricked sigil of Solraheen.
Mandri turned to protest his new accommodation.
“Sit down and be quiet,” Seb commanded.
Before Mandri could frame his dissent, a dark shape flew towards him and crashed into his stomach. He wheezed, went sprawling against the wall and sank down to the floor. He fumbled around in the dark and squealed in disgust when his thumb poked through a stiff and gristly cloth and dove into something with the consistency of fire-crusted jelly. 
It wasn’t until Obo’s airy laugh came giggling out from under Mandri’s armpit that Mandri realized what had just happened—Seb had thrown Obo at him, and he’d just plumbed his thumb into Obo’s stumped thigh.
“Get off me!” Mandri shrieked.
“I hardly can,” said Obo. “I’m wrapped up tight.”
Mandri gruffly picked Obo up. The Mazid was about as light as a two-year-old.
“Put me down.”
“Stop wiggling.”
“I’m not, you’re shaking me.”
“There’s nowhere to put you.”
“Quit your flappin’!” Seb shouted. “And stop touchin’ shit. This is a sacred place.”
Mandi didn’t want to get slapped so he shut up and stuffed Obo in between his good right leg and the wall. He had to bunch himself up closer to the other side and that was a dicey proposition, because something dead was resting there and he didn’t want his wound rubbing up against it. 
Mandri prayed for a light, and by Sol, there it was—a diffuse glow of lamp light came creeping up the blackrock corridor wall behind Seb. Seb spun around and there was the girl Purl, standing in the room’s entrance, looking as if she’d just picked herself up from rolling down a dune. Her robes were as dirty as a sandrat, and her hair was as wild as  a weedbush puffing out of the wide black bandanna that she’d affixed to her forehead. The red kell oil smeared on her face picked up the warm light and made it seem as if her cheeks were rubbed raw, down to the bleeding muscle.
Mandri recalled the sight of her screaming at Obo to kneel back in that pit cave a day or two before. She seemed much healthier.
She peered around Seb at Mandri, as if looking for him. 
“Move,” she said to Seb. Seb begrudgingly stepped out of the room to give her the space to enter. As she did, the oil-dish lamp she held before her splayed its light into the room’s interior, bringing this haunting ‘closet’ to life.
Cut into the black rock walls were coffin-sized slits, three on either side, stacked one above the other. Inside each of these, resting in peaceful repose, was a corpse, each in a different stage of decomposition, and each naked as it came from the womb, and all of them, as far as Mandri could tell, were giant men. Ayram-sized men. Their beards were black and gray.
The corpse that the light lit clearest was as black and shriveled as a grape weeks fallen from the vine. It was impossible to say for certain how long that body had been laying there, for an unbothered corpse in the Sand could last an age, but cloistered away in Minting Rock, sheltered from the wind and abrasion, Mandri figured that a corpse could last for as long as Solraheen willed it. That body could be as ancient as the world itself. It was disgusting.
A desiccated hand with purpled fingers.
Shadows licked at a dry, pruned up shoulder.
All of it frosted by a layer of dust.
No hint of bloat, no tar-like iridescence of fresh rot that might explain the smell.
Then Mandri looked down and saw the spreading rot in his own leg and he wondered if the smell was coming from him.
Purl set her lamp down in a shallow recess in the wall which had been carved for the purpose. With her other arm—her handless arm—she was clutching a smallgrass basket close to her chest, and this she set on the floor at Mandri’s feet. She squatted down and began to unload it—first out was a puffy square of gray wool folded into itself. Next was a bundle of damp leaves knotted at the stems. Then came a stone mortar which tinked against the floor. Last came three small alabastron jars that were packed to the brim with waxy substances, one red, one green, and one blue. Purl hesitated with these, treated them more gently than the rest, and once all were arrayed out before her, she handed the basket back to Seb, who tucked it mindlessly into one of the corpsedens, and left the room.
“Let me see the bite,” she said to Mandri.
Mandri drew up his robe and leaned onto his right ass cheek. He rolled his wounded thigh into the light. The poultice was wrinkled and sloppy, hanging half off. Purl eyed the dark veins in his leg with a keen interest.
“Would you look at that,” she muttered.
She pulled a thumb-sized pestle from her ruddy robes and she dolloped a two-finger-dip of each of the colorful waxes into her mortar. Purl’s one good hand wasn’t used to doing two things at the same time, so each time she clawed wax from a jar, the jar slid and teetered on its base, and each time she had to catch it, her handless left arm hanging in the air like a useless friend.
“How bad does it hurt?”
“About as bad as can be.”
Purl peeled back the old poultice from Mandri’s leg to reveal the black wound underneath. It was an awful sight, smothered over with that mucky paste.
“Your timing is lucky,” she said dryly. “One more night and it would be permanent.”
“What are you doing?”
Purl pushed Mandri back with a miffed look and then set herself to mixing the medicine in the mouth of her mortar. She poured a finger full of water from her personal waterskin into it, swirled it around with the wax, then she plucked three leaves and dropped them onto the swimming globs of color. Once this was done to satisfaction, she began to knead it all into a paste.
Mandri watched with eager intent, and so did Obo. Obo leaned over Mandri’s legs, trying to peer into the mixture, but since he was hardly more than a ribcage swiveling on hips, ‘leaning’ was a chancy thing. Mandri had to catch him to keep him from tipping over, and this commotion interrupted Purl’s pestle’s rhythmic thump. She paused and gave Obo the same miffed look she’d given Mandri a moment before.
Obo said, “I thought that wax was insoluble in water.”
“Must not be wax,” said Purl, and she resumed smashing the bits of leaves down into the sopping goop. By now the colors were beginning to mix, turning a greenish shade of brown that looked nearly black in the lamplight. Obo was polite enough to wait until she was finished to ask, “Would you mind if I tasted it?”
The disgust in Purl’s face was absolute, with thin lines wearing deep furrows in her forehead—this was a look she often wore. Most outland women end up with rumpled foreheads, and it’s not just from squinting at the sun. From first blood they’re fighting wars of aggravation against outland men. The difference here was that the nuisance at hand was a Mazid, not a man, and he wasn’t rebuffed in the usual way. His eyes were bright, expecting entertainment.
Purl grumbled and set again to her work. She unfolded the woolen square to make a pocket which she then packed full with the dark goo from her mortar. She scraped the bottom of the mortar to make sure she’d left no leavings. Obo interrupted her concentration by saying, “I’d like to introduce myself.”
Purl rolled her eyes and did not respond.
Mandri saw that Obo was about to make a mistake by pressing the girl, and he felt compelled to intervene.
He said, “Obo, stop.” 
Purl’s brow knit even tighter, “You call it Obo?” she asked.
“That’s his name.”
“You share names with a Mazid?”
“We’ve been talking.”
Purl cradled the poultice wrap with her good hand, then plopped it paste-down on the Mandri’s wound. A shock of pain ran through his hip and he almost bit through his tongue. Soon after a quick iciness flooded into the wound and chased the pain deep down to the bone. When the wincing excitement wore off, he was surprised to find that the pain was almost gone entirely. His leg was cold and numb.
“Oh,” he said, relief shaping his voice. “That was fast.”
Purl said, “What would you and a Mazid have to talk about?”
“We’ve been scheming an escape,” Mandri said, and he snuck a side-long smirk towards Obo. “That’s why he wants to introduce himself. He wants to figure out how he can use you. The more he knows about you, the better he can manipulate you. That’s what he’s been doing with me. He’s a schemer. Look at him.”
Both he and Purl looked at Obo.
“That is not true,” Obo said, eyes locked on Purl.
“He also told me he never lies, so you know that means he lies all the time.”
“That is not true either.”
“Obo, you’re not fooling anyone.”
Purl stood up in a huff and her eyes flicked to the ends of the unwrapped poultice. “Tie it up yourself,” she said, and she quickly gathered her ministrations and left in flurry.
Thankfully, she’d left her oil lamp.
“What did you do that!?” Obo exclaimed. His face was not well suited for anger. With hairless brows and lashless eyes, his face looked more like an underpainting for a face than a real one.
Mandri replied, “I was trying to earn her trust.”
“You would earn her trust by betraying mine?”
“That’s the idea.”
“You would prove yourself trustworthy by being untrustworthy?”
Mandri set about wrapping the ends of the poultice around his leg. “If we want her to tell us what is going on, then we’ve got to get her to lower her guard, and the best way to do that is to be honest. Honesty is disarming. You should try it sometime.”
“Honesty requires discretion, Mandri, otherwise it causes more problems than it solves.”
“I know what I’m doing.”
“Yet, she left the room.”
“Obo, she left because of you. She hates you. They all hate you. They’re not ever going to talk to you, and because of that, we’ve got to get them to talk to me, and to do that, they have to trust me. If that means they trust you less, so be it. What’s the harm?”
Obo’s mood softened a little. “I don’t blame you for not knowing this—it’s my fault for not telling you—but this girl reacts extremely negatively to anything that doesn’t reek of kindness.”
“What makes you say that?”
“Anything that’s harsh, or argumentative, or loud, puts her off. She removes herself from any perceived hostility.”
“How could you possibly know that?”
“That girl is my Minder.”
“So?”
“As we speak, her fingers are gripping my heart. She has bound me to her will, so I can feel hers. I’ve only had one other Minder’s will coursing through my veins, and he was as foul a man as ever lived, so believe me when I tell you that I know what a will without kindness feels like—Purl is different. I can feel her cringe at the mere thought of two people angling at each other.”
Mandri had a hard time processing all this. He couldn’t get past the image of a human hand squeezing the Mazid’s heart.
“Well…that’s interesting…but don’t expect any kindness from me, so we might as well write Purl off.”
“She is my Minder. I can’t very well ‘write off’ the person who holds my will hostage. We must indulge her kindness. I don’t see why this isn’t a positive thing. She could have been cruel.”
“Kindness doesn’t mean what you think it means.”
“Oh?”
“Think about it—on average, and this is true, on average, people are more likely to hate each other than love each other, aren’t they? So if kindness is how one person treats its own kind, then a kind person is a selfish, hostile person.”
“Mandri, it doesn’t matter what word we use to describe her. I think you’ve spent too much time biting burgeons.”
“You think I’m wrong?”
“I think you’re distracted. We’re far afield from the problem at hand.”
“What are you talking about, we’re right on point. If we want to get in with these Ayramun, we’ve got to agree on how to go about doing it. If you tell me to be kind to someone, I’m going to be kind, but I have a different—more correct—understanding of the word.”
Obo paused, stared straight ahead, listening for something which Mandri could not hear. He said, “Mandri, there is a column of Hrkan Skulsi marching towards this rock.”
“Oh,” Mandri muttered.
Obo nodded and said, “They’ll be here within a finger. When they get here, they’re going to slaughter us all.”
Obo’s gray eyes settled into an easy gleam as if he were almost happy about it. He then turned his sight towards the stippled sign of Solraheen, again listening. “Actually, they’re here already.”
His words heralded the deep and yawning howl of the Hrkan horn of war. 
BWEEEEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooommmm
The sound shook the wall against Mandri’s back while the rest of Minting Rock was sent stirring with the hollers of the Ayramun barking their excitement. Mandri, bewildered, stood up, pushing himself up against the narrow walls, doing so carefully to not bother his leg, all so that he could turn and look through one of the small holes in the eightfold sun. He couldn’t see much, but out there, sure enough, set against a field of fiery sand was a white-robed column of men.
“Well I think this proves my point,” he said. “People don’t march around like that to help out widows and orphans, do they? That, there, is the kindness of men in full regalia. I wonder whose kindness is stronger, those Hrks or these Ayramun.”
“Mandri, I can almost guarantee that you will be dead in less than half a hand.”
“The Ayramun can win, can’t they?”
“Seventeen Ayramun against eighty Skulsi is long odds.”
“Ayram’s got to count for at least twenty. And this rock is practically a fortress. It’s got murder holes. What are the Hrks going to do, lay siege? Out here in the desert?”
“I don’t know, but I’m sure they have a plan.”
“The Ayramun have got you.”
“No they don’t.”
“Oh come on, Obo. You know, I’ve never actually seen a Mazid spit Mazidfire.”
“And you likely never will.”
“So you’re going to sit there and let them come and kill me? I thought we were friends.”
“We are.”
“Obo, if you open your mouth and blast those Hrks to Shis, I will wash your feet with oil.”
“I don’t have any feet.”
“I’ll wash your nubs with the richest blueseed oil that I can find. I’ll make it myself.”
Obo sighed and shook his head. “I don’t have choice in the matter.”
Mandri was halfway through sighing his displeasure, when a shrill and steady whistle sounded out from the Hrkan column and pierced his thoughts, pushing out all other concerns. 
It was a metallic, tinny tone that quivered like a strandtail’s warble, only it was ten times louder and harsher than the shriek of a hawk. That damned sound cut through the rock so clearly that its source might as well have been in the room. For Mandri, it was an ear-splitting pain, but to Obo it was doing something stranger.
The Mazid had fallen over onto his side and was squirming. His eyes were rolling around in their sockets, twitching and turning as if a worm were chewing on his ocular nerve. The whistling jumped to a higher pitch and Obo’s whole body began to convulse in violent fits. Mandri reached out to keep Obo’s head from thumping against the stone, but before he could do anything to help, Obo’s stomach wretched, his chest heaved, and a dim gray formless ember shot out from his mouth, leaving his body limp and lifeless. The strange light hovered just above Obo’s lips for the briefest spell, and then the whistling shifted its register again, higher still into a pitch reserved for animal spirits, and the gray ember shot right towards Mandri’s head.
He ducked and the ember whizzed past his neck, its energy scorching his skin as it went. It zipped on to punch a hole the size of Mandri’s fist into the rock behind him. Mandri spun around in time to watch it fly up into the air. He lost sight of it for a moment against the bright midday sky, then found it again as it dove towards the distant column of Hrks. As it fell, the whistling fell to a drowning timbre, until, with a flash, the light and the whistling were snuffed out altogether, as if swallowed up by a figure at the head of the Hrkan column—a figure much shorter than the rest and robed in black.
Before Mandri’s ears could recover their tuning, the Hrkan horn of war sounded out again.
BWWWEEEEeeeeoooooooommmm.
The deep bellow shook Mandri out of his skin. He’d heard the horn once already, but this time—this time he knew the horn was blowing for him. Terror welled up in his gut. He could see the column clearly now through his punched out window, and as the Hrks marched they flattened out into a solid square. A command was barked and the soldiers quickened their advance, bracing their white, oblong shields up against the smattering of arrows that was sure to come.
Twenty paces later, and Mandri heard the twang of bows and fluttering phhht of arrow fletchings brushing through the air, rushing high up into the sky. Ten Hrkan paces later, and a flock of black arrows fell upon the hide of that onrushing Hrkan square. Most of these missiles bounced harmlessly away, but some snuck in between the scales, marked here and there by the sudden tumbling of one of the Hrkan number, each followed by a chorus of triumphant hollers as several Ayramun took credit all at once.
These little victories did nothing to slow the Hrkan advance. Every gap opened by the felling of one soldier was closed in quick-step time, and when, at last, it was clear that they would not scatter and flee, the hollering of the Ayramun twisted into stressed appeals for Solraheen’s intervention. Mandri could hear the more practical Ayramun sprinting from room to room, trying to find better angled holes to fire upon their target, sometimes crashing into each other, screaming insults as whole bundles of arrows were split.
Seb rushed by Mandri’s hole, then came back, noticing the fresh new vantage in the wall.
“Move out of the way!” he shouted as ran in. He kicked Obo’s lifeless body to the side, then squatted down and started firing arrows down at the marching men. They were close enough now that their faces could be seen peering over their shields.
Seb fired his arrows with ruthless efficiency, but judging by the stream of curses that followed every shot, he was missing his mark. After each twang of his bow, his shooting angle shifted steeper and steeper to match the Hrkan advance, until at last the white-cloaked Hrks tucked themselves up under Minting Rock’s bulging belly. Seb he grabbed his bow in both hands and snapped it on his knee, then pulled his dagger and fled from the room.
Then Mandri heard a noise which froze his body solid.

Chink-TINK.

“What was that?” Mandri wondered aloud.

Chink-TINK.

It sounded like a chisel.
He looked again through the hole in the wall and tried to make sense of the situation. Directly below was a bevy of upturned shields, in the center of each, the gold-eyed Hrkan sun was looking up at him with dumb indifference.
TINK-TINK-TINK
The chiseling was getting louder, faster, followed close behind by the roars of Hrkan men possessed by the spirit of battle. Somewhere far below, in Minting Rock’s entrance well, limbs were getting hacked to pieces.
Then came a loud stone-splitting crack and the whole of Minting Rock lurched. 
Mandri stumbled but caught himself as the sound of crunching rock ran through the floor and ceiling.
#
CRRRCKKKKkkkk-krrrk-kkkkkk-k

All went silent in the wake of this rock-hewn thunder.
There were no shouts of struggle below.
No clash of sword on shield.
For a brief, glorious moment, every Spark from man to flea dropped their troubles and shared the exact same fearish feeling, and this communion might have lasted forever if it weren’t split by the tinny sound of a chisel striking stone.

TINK

A long, jagged crack exploded into the floor of Mandri’s burial chamber and he jumped as Minting Rock lurched again. The dust of ages shook loose from the ceiling, as if the room above had been hammered by Solraheen’s fist.
“Obo,” Mandri said to the glassy-eyed and lifeless Mazid. “Obo, we’d better leave.”
Another jolt shook the room, and the crack in the floor opened wider. Mandri shuffled away just as a thunderous boom sent the crack darting across the whole length of the floor and up the sun-stippled wall, fracturing the chamber in two. Then suddenly the chamber’s whole left side slid down an inch before coming to a rest on some new fault in the foundation far below.
Mandri, fear pulsing in chest, yanked one of the aged corpses out of its resting place and tossed it onto the ground. He then grabbed Obo’s limp body and threw the Mazid into the now unoccupied grave. He pushed Obo as far towards the back as he could, and then Mandri crawled in alongside him. The very moment that Mandri tucked in his legs, the opposite wall started to collapse.
The first thing to go was Purl’s clay oil lamp. It jostled loose from its perch and smashed onto the floor, splashing licks of oil and flame about the room. Then the wall behind it shook, and the seams in the ceiling burst, shooting a jet of smoke into the room, flooding Mandri’s grave with dust, obscuring the air so completely that Mandri could not see the hail of stone come crashing down. What he did see, a moment later, after wiping the dust from his eyes, was the awesome sight of Minting Rock split in half like a geode.
Before he could even register his shock, the opposite half began to fall away. 
Haunting screams split the air as those Ayramun stuck on the wrong side of this split-open stone grasped their impending doom. Three men, on the floor above Mandri, jumped across to Mandri’s side, but below, a ragged, fear-stricken woman straddled the half-shorn wall of what once was a tunnel. Mandri watched in terror as she rode the undone structure down into a billowing cloud of dust, crying a prayer up to Solraheen as she went.
Mandri closed his eyes against the deafening crash.
“Solraheen, my god,” Mandri prayed. It was the start of a daily prayer, but the rest of the words, Mandri had long forgotten.
He opened his eyes again, and peered down at the chaos from his blessed perch. The floor was completely gone, and in its place was a hundred foot drop down into a swirl of rust-colored smoke.
Then, as the smoke lifted—
A swarm of white Hrkan cloaks far below, some moving amongst the crumble of black rock, some deathly still.
Then some of the black rocks moved, some jumped out of the structure still left standing—Ayramun in their dark, dusty rags.
A yell rang out and the two sides rushed each other. Once again, the battle was joined.
Mandri crept back into his hole—there was no clear way to get down, not that he wanted to get down. He was oddly happy to be stuck up in his high hole. No matter who won down below, he’d be safe.

TINK
TINK
TINK

Whatever demon had split open Minting Rock was not finished, and this time Mandri could feel the chisel strokes resonate all through the rock around him. He curled up in that grave, wrapped his head in his hands and tried to shut out the horror of it, but his sense of equilibrium remained, and it screamed bloody murder as his half of Minting Rock began to tilt.
At first it was only a slight shifting as the rock swayed away from the melee down below. Then a loud clap of snapping stone sounded out, and Mandri’s perch swayed precariously back the opposite direction. He scrambled to grab hold of something, to stop himself from spilling out of his hole and into the open air, and just as his hip began to slide, a thunder of faulting joints burst up from below, and a puff of smoke shot up behind it. The whole terrifying thing swayed back away yet again, before settling into an unstable, precipitous tilt. What was left of Minting Rock dithered there, letting the dread get nice and settled in Mandri’s belly, until, at last, there came a shattering CRACK, and the structure began to fall. Mandri braced himself in that half-shorn tomb as the horizon fell out of the sky.
The whole structure rolled onto its back like a freshly halved melon. Mandri could do nothing but look to the sky and feel helpless. If there were clouds they would have been zipping by, but there was only the atmosphere, that gradient of blue shifting into a deeper blue, and for the first time ever, Mandri noticed that the desert sky is a bluer blue than any other. He didn’t have time to wonder why that was, for amid the rush and tumble, his sight was swallowed up by a cloud of black-red dust and a suffocating blur of sand and stone. Before Mandri could fully realize the horror of being buried alive, the rock grave cradling him snapped open, and the rock bottom sprung loose like a tensioned lever, catapulting him into the air. 
Mandri flew a few yards above the surface of the earth. Such was his speed that he smashed right through the brambles of a karkle bush before tumbling into a ragdoll skip along the surface of the warm red-orange sand.
When he finally came to a stop, he found himself half buried in a fledgling dune.
And he was alive.
He pulled himself free from the sand, spit some of it out of his mouth, coughed a bit of dust out of his lungs, then rubbed his eyes open, surprised to see that his scrawny self was still well-put-together. The shoulder which had borne the brunt of impact wasn’t even scratched. There weren’t any bones sticking out, at least. And while the demon bite on his leg was still smarting, Purl’s poultice was still knotted tight. Everything else was where it was supposed to be. The only thing that truly hurt was the left side of his face, which had bit the sand when he landed. Still, that was nothing. Considering everything, that was nothing. He’d been tossed almost fifty yards and was no worse for wear. Meanwhile, what was left of Minting Rock had collapsed into a heap of rubble.
It was a miracle. 
It was a miracle coming after a string of miracles. By rights he should be dead—dead three times over. In Meskalim, Salavan had choked to death, and he’d come back from that. He’d been chewed up by a demon, and just happened to be traveling with a woman who knew how to cure it. And now he’d survived a fall from a height that should have squashed him flat.
Here he was, alive and breathing.
“Wild,” Mandri mused.
He looked up at the bright blue sky and blinked at the sun, and he felt, in that blessed moment, that he was staring into the eye of Solraheen Himself. Perhaps this rapture would have drawn out a word of praise, and he might have converted then and there to the most devout of all possible men, but it was not to be, for a Hrkan Skulsi was creeping up behind him.
“Die, you rangy lizard!”
Mandri turned and saw a mustachioed man in a sparkling white robe running at him with his blade drawn high. Despite the look of fury and rage twisting this soldier’s face, Mandri wasn’t frightened. Actually, he felt a confidence brewing. If he was supposed to be dead three times over, then what was a fourth?
He held up his hands and shouted, “I surrender!”
The soldier stopped his sprint and seemed pleased to hear it. A proud curve swelled in his chest, and he stomped over to where Mandri knelt. 
“My luck I should catch a coward,” he said. He held his shining iron sword towards Mandri’s neck and beckoned with its tip for Mandri to stand up.
Mandri stood up.
“Walk,” said the soldier, and he pointed with his sword in the desired direction, towards a detachment of white cloaked soldiers standing some thirty yards away from the cloud of Minting Rock’s still seething rubble. These Hrks stood shoulder to shoulder, watching the death of Minting Rock as if it were something they’d seen ten times before, and perhaps they had. They were big, bearded men, veterans of many battles.
Mandri winced as his captor’s sword prodded the small of his back, and he began to walk towards the Hrkan line. And as the squealing stone of Minting Rock settled into it’s final resting place, the air came alive again with the clamor of battle—breathless shouts of fury, metal clanging against metal, a staccato burst of excited yips, punctuated here and there by cries of agony.
The first actual figure to pop out of that lifting smoke was Moto. The Zosan was crouching atop a tall, slanted chunk of former floor, and with one hand he steadied himself, and with his sword he deftly waved off three Hrkan blades swiping at his ankles. Then Purl came scrambling out from a hole in the nearby rubble and disappeared further into the swirling cloud of dust. Two Hrkan cloaks chased after her, but both came to a sudden, fluttering stop after something swung out of the dust and slammed into their chests—a bone-crunching WHUMP. The two men collapsed to the ground, and standing over them was Ayram.
The giant was so caked in dust that he looked like a creature borne from the Sand. The upper part of his black robe was hanging in tatters over his waistband like it were half-molted skin, and his long black hair, freed from his headwrap, was sweeping his shoulders clean as he twirled his long, blackened iron spear like it were a reed. He slammed it down and smashed its knobby end right through the skull of one of the fallen Hrks.
The blood-crunch was so loud that Mandri almost tripped. The three Hrkan men who’d been bothering Moto turned towards the giant and screamed curses at the man who’d slain their comrade with such brutal indifference. Ayram charged them, swung his spear in a swooping arc, and that famed Skulsi discipline went to Shis as the iron crunched through the first Hrk’s shield. In a blur, the chisel-head swung round and sliced right through the face of another. The final hapless soldier charged and stabbed, but such was Ayram’s speed that his iron spear was around again in time to brush the sword right out of Skulsi’s hand. 
The man backed away in fright. He picked up a rock and threw it at Ayram’s head, and before Mandri could see how Ayram dealt with it, he felt another sharp prodding in his back.
“Get a move on!” The soldier behind him shouted. The man was unconcerned about his comrade’s plight. He was more interested in getting Mandri to the Hrkan line. So impatient was he, that he took Mandri by the wrist, upped the pace to a jog, and yanked a howling Mandri along behind, for though Purl’s poultice was a soothing balm, Mandri’s demon-bitten leg wasn’t capable of handling a run.
After much fumbling and stumbling, they reached the Hrkan detachment and Mandri was thrown down to the sand. His captor then set the cold edge of his blade on the back of Mandri’s neck to keep his head bowed in deference. The man then pounded his chest twice—the standard Hrkan salute—and with the snap of a well-drilled soldier he declared, “My sirs, I’ve found another skulking bandit.”
Mandri overcame the fear of the blade pressing against his neck to peep at the ‘sirs’ this soldier was referring to, and he was stunned to see that standing in front of him was a boy robed in black. Mandri stole a second glance and realized that it was not a boy, but a creature, one crafted by the Hrks—white and hairless as Obo and so short that Mandri, kneeling, met him eye to bloodshot eye. Shielding this creature’s nose and mouth was a smooth iron plate riveted onto a leather band that was strapped tight around its head. It was a strange sort of muzzle, with only a small beveled hole for sipping air, and, Mandri presumed, for whistling, for no doubt this was the Mazidariga who had whistled Obo’s pseudo-Spark into its own stomach. 
 The Hrkan Lords were fleshcrafters whose works could rival the perversions of Shis—or so it was rumored—and no doubt some painful twisting of anatomy was hidden under that Mazidariga’s muzzle, and no doubt it was the work of a twisted mind, for this Riga’s eyes were a child’s eyes, large and curious, yet their whites were so red that their edges were weeping blood, and worse still, the creature seemed accustomed to it.
Next to this Riga child was a tall bald man clad in the baggy blue robes of a Hrkan scribe. All the fat on his body seemed to have settled in his face, giving him a curiously large head for his frame. It was such an incongruity, and scribes were such venal creatures, that Mandri wondered if this man had bribed some younger, fitter person for the use of their body. It was either that, or he, too, was the work of the Hrkan Lords.
This scribe did not look at all pleased to see Mandri. No scribe ever was, for scribes of rank were learned men of acquired power, and they kept their silver sunrose brooches bright and blinding. They put so much effort into setting themselves apart that they could sense when someone didn’t appreciate them. 
The man looked down at Mandri, and with plain derision in his voice he said, “Another coward lurking in the rubble.”
The Riga child coughed, as if clearing his throat of sores, then said through its muffling mask, “I smell the Mazid on him.” There was no hint of menace in the child’s words—it was merely a statement of fact. 
“Yes,” said the scribe, thoughtfully. He turned to address the soldier who’d captured Mandri. “The young master told you to fetch the Mazid’s body, not another sniveling rat.”
“Yes sir. Yes, master.” 
The soldier saluted again, then ran back towards the rubble.
“And you,” the scribe said to Mandri, “The Law affords you an opportunity to repent of your crimes. I don’t suppose you’ll take it?”
“Uh…sure, I’ll take it.”
The scribe’s lumpy brow jumped up and said, “Very well. Then you shall be delivered to the nearest Lord and be sold into slavery. Someone take him away.”
“Hold on! Hold on. Wait. I haven’t done anything.”
“Oh, you haven’t, have you?” the scribe said, clearly amused.
“I’m an honest Jandri man,” said Mandri. “The people in that rock stole me outside of Meskalem three days ago. I was their prisoner.”
“A prisoner?” The scribe said, and his incredulity slid naturally into a skeptical, chubby-cheeked chortle. “You speak cleanly for an outland poke.” The man then leaned over to address the Mazidariga to ensure the child had the correct interpretation of Mandri’s words.
“This is what we call outland bluster. He is no doubt an outlaw like the rest of them.”
“Is he?” the Riga croaked.
“Indeed he is. He is a liar. We shall keep him along with the other liar so they may be dealt the liar’s punishment.”
The scribe nodded to a nearby soldier, who then dragged Mandri to his feet and led him behind the Hrkan line to where one of the Ayramun, Seb, was being held. 
Seb was so caked in the dust of Minting Rock’s collapse that he looked like a mangled root just dug up from the earth. And through it all, he still smelled. Seb looked surprised to see Mandri, though he did not speak a word of acknowledgment.
“Right then,” said the scribe. “Time to clean this mess up.” 
The Hrkan horn sounded out and the soldiers lurched forwards into a ridiculous parade march, a heel-stomping strut, and they looked proud to do it as if the Hrkan Lords themselves were watching. The scribe and Mazidariga ambled along in front, while both Mandri and Seb were forced at sword point to keep close behind. Soon the Hrkan soldiers came to a halt and spread out into a skirmishing line, giving Mandri a clean view of the corpse of Minting Rock.
The structure, having split in two and fallen apart, now formed two halves of an impromptu arena, with the rubble on either side rising step-like into the air, complete with dead spectators oozing out between the cracks of pancaked floors. Staged on the arena below was the giant Ayram. He stood resolute with four dead Hrks at his feet, one with his nose smashed flat against his skull, another with his face opened up completely. It seemed that Ayram had the artist’s impulse for rearrangement, as well as a madman’s eye for beauty—he seemed to believe that a man’s face was more pleasing to the eye if it were parted down the middle and hanging down around the shoulders.
Behind Ayram, crouching up on rocks like black-scratchers fleeing an incoming tide, were three of his band—Moto, the old witch Elrahet, and Purl.
The scribe stepped forth to address them all.
“The battle is over,” he said. “Lay down your weapons and submit yourselves to the Law.”
The scribe clearly bore no actual expectation that the Ayramun would surrender. This was a formality, and formalities were honored because formality was what separated civilized men from the animals. The difference between a slaughter and the exercise of justice was whether or not it was preceded by an announcement. If one announces what they’re going to do, whatever happens next is the victim’s fault. 
The scribe rolled his shoulders back, puffed out his chest and said, “Since you have chosen life outside of the natural laws which govern all mankind, you will be dealt with according to the law of beasts. You shall be captured and sold in the court of the Great Lord Hababeen. If you persist in your barbarity, we shall undress your weight with a dull blade and feed your trimmings to pigs.”
The scribe’s chubby cheeks spread into a frown as if he weren’t pleased to be issuing his threat—this was also a formality. Mandri had met his fair share of scribes assigned to posts in the Sand, and to a man they were perverted. The strange bureaucracy that surrounds the culling of outland folk attracts them, and the closer they held to the letter of the law, the more perverse was the performance, and the more satisfaction they gleaned.
The scribe motioned for both Mandri and Seb to be brought to him.
 “Toss your weapon on the ground,” he said to Ayram, “Or all of you shall be carved to the bone, beginning with these two skulking cowards.”
Ayram planted the chisel-tip of his giant iron spear into the sand, but he did not loosen his grip.
The scribe grabbed Mandri by the scruff. “Let it be known that the course of law was offered and was rejected.” 
He pulled a short knife from his robe and raised it up so all could see.
“I say one last time—toss your weapon! The light of the law demands it!”
He lowered the knife to meet Mandri’s throat.
Ayram looked like an ancient outland idol cloaked in the dust of untamed earth and anointed with the blood of weaker men. Mandri watched with bated breath as this wildman decided whether or not to surrender to a frail-backed, skinny-fat scribe. Yes, there were Skulsi here too, but never in all the turns of the world could such a man surrender to such a man.
Mandri felt an urge to do something to save his neck, and urges like this one, urges overwhelming, they claw themselves out of the stomach regardless of whether or not they’re welcome in the world. He instinctively squirmed—he knew not why but he squirmed under the firm grip of the scribe, who could sense Mandri’s desperation, but  he’d slit a throat or two before and it seemed he knew how to handle a criminal’s neck. Nonetheless, Mandri squirmed. He hadn’t felt an upwell from his Spark in years—and he was so unused to its working on him that it passed through him all too easily, too quickly, so that instead of coiling him up and unleashing a twist of fury, what came out of his body was a sneeze—a sneeze with snot and spittle—and it came bursting out to fleck the knife and hand of the Hrkan scribe.
The scribe recoiled in horror, as if the flag of snot dripping down the meat of his thumb was the most repulsive thing he’d ever seen. 
“You disgusting poke!” he screamed.
He made to wipe it off on Mandri’s cheek, but before his knife’s tip grazed Mandri’s skin, the tip of Ayram’s spear slammed into the scribe’s chest.
The scribe was thrown back by force. A rasping howl issued from his throat as the spear slid halfway through him and slammed into the earth behind, propping the dying man up like a skewered pig.
Ayram had thrown the damn thing. He’d thrown it over thirty yards and hit his target square in the chest. And he wasn’t done with that—he was sprinting towards the Hrkan line, roaring like the beast the scribe had named him.
The white cloaked Skulsi closed rank to meet him.
Mandri didn’t know what to expect next, but it certainly wasn’t the sight of Ayram leaping over the line of swinging Hrkan swords. The giant came tumbling down behind them and rolled into a run, and three strides later he was standing over the scribe’s corpse and reclaimed his spear. From there, he turned on the chasing Hrkan Skulsi and swung.
Ayram wielded his spear as efficiently as Mandri could handle a brush—a tight economy of strokes. Twenty-something Hrkan men he had to kill, Hrkan Skulsi no less, veterans of battle with bulging calves from all the marching, with manly beards and mule-kicked brows, faces to fear—how many swings of a spear should it take to bring down such a number? Surely the giant would have to waste a twirl or two to parry the swarm of blows against him. Fifty? If not fifty, then twenty? Mandri might have believed twenty if someone had told him the story secondhand.
His disbelieving eyes counted ten.
Ten strokes to kill at least twenty hardscrabble soldiers. Ten powerful strokes. And it wasn’t like Mandri would do in a portrait, where he’d make a stroke and wipe it away until he got it right—there was no room for error here, every sweeping stroke was deliberate and precise, for each had to solve at least two problems at once. Truly, these were the marks of genius. 
When it was over, Mandri wondered why any of it was necessary in the first place. It seemed Ayram could slaughter the world and none would stop him. But when the last white cloak fell, Ayram dropped to his knees. There was a long bloody gash running down his ribs. He had not been perfect, if perfection was such a thing.
The giant drew a deep breath and called for Moto. Moto came running, and as he approached, Ayram said, “Kill the rat.”
At first, Mandri thought Ayram was talking about him, then he thought Ayram was referring to Seb, but when Moto went sprinting past them both, Mandri saw the Mazidariga child running away into the empty desert, running as fast as his little legs could carry him.</Text>

            <Title>Obo's Story</Title>
            <Text>During the brief rest period each night, one of the Ayramun would tell a story. The fourth night, Moteah asked Mandri for a story, and Mandri offered the spot to Obo. No one else wanted to hear the Mazid tell a story until Moto claimed that it was impossible for Obo to tell a story, as a good story requires a Spark to tell it. Now that everyone was wondering whether or not Obo could tell a good story, he was allowed.
“My story is about a witch,” he said.
He gave Elrahet with a furtive smile. “Maybe you knew her.”
She grumbled, and he continued on.
“This witch was a cantankerous witch who dwelt in a cave where the sea meets the desert. She gained fame throughout the land for her talent of divination. To leverage her talents, a person must first catch a karkoot lizard, put its stomach in a jar of brine, then bring that stomach to the witch in her wilderness cave. In return, the witch would foretell the future. So great were her talents that people hunted karkoots until there were none left, though that’s not what this story is about—that is an aside meant to highlight the shortsightedness of human beings.”
Several groans erupted from amongst the Ayramun. Satisfied with these, Obo smiled and continued on.
“One day a young man went to see this witch. But this story begins long before that day. The story begins with the boy’s father. His father, the carpenter, wasn’t rich, for he was a carpenter. Woe betide him, his son was a profligate child—that means he was wasteful. Whether it was beer, women, or friends, he spent his father’s money without caring. He had no respect for his father’s work. In a way, you can’t blame the boy, he was too young to understand how hard his father worked. But the father did work. He worked hard to pay for his son’s schooling in a richer city. He hoped that his son would surpass him in society.
“So, the son, living in a different city, took his father’s money, money meant for his education, and he spent it on beer, women, and friends. His life’s prospects quickly come to nothing. When the father finds out that his own son had beggared them both, his rage—his rage was profound. It might be hard for any here to understand because none of you, as I understand, have children—”
“Neither do you,” said Mandri.
“Yes, but you see, we Mazidai are supremely empathetic creatures—not that you aren’t, it is simply different. Let me try to paint the father’s rage for you. Given the rough nature of our present circumstances, and perhaps the ultimate goal of our quest as we seek to kill a demon who seeks to end creation, you all must have some sympathy for the idea that existence is some kind of mistake. It lacks purpose. Contrast that with me, a Mazid—not only was I built for an explicit purpose, I know what it is. You, however, must have a nagging sense of the absence of yours. At least we can say that it is not at all clear what that purpose is—don’t the Solitants admit as much? I would argue that it is clearly obvious that you have no purpose, and I can prove it.”
Moto groaned and said, “I told you he can’t tell a story.”
“If a human ever finds themself blessed with wealth and health beyond comprehension, what happens to them? I can tell you what happens, as I’ve seen first hand how impoverishing wealth is when your kind gets it. I’ve seen through the eyes of the Hrkan Lords. Without any practical concerns to distract them, one might think they would be happy, for they are free to pursue their life’s true purpose. But that’s not what happens! They are not happy, they are bored. Totally bored. It is a boredom so thorough and complete that some kill themselves. That might be hard for you to fathom, but I speak the truth. Their boredom is complete. And what does it all mean? If a person, freed from the indignities of life, turns, naturally, to boredom, what does that mean? It means that your natural rest state is nothingness, and that you have no intrinsic purpose. If you did have one, surely your natural state would reflect it.”
“What does any of this have to do with the carpenter?” Moteah asked.
“This is the backdrop to every story ever told. You see, because you have no natural purpose, what purpose you do have is crafted, and that means it is something you can lose. And I put it to you that losing your purpose is the greatest horror a human can experience. Don’t smile, Mandri, you of all people should know this. You are so scared to lose your purpose that you won’t even stick to one in the first place. You are sitting firmly in that quarter of all people who got burnt when they were young and that little jab of horror has tranquilized them for the rest of their lives. You are little better than that quarter of all people who are so inured to the vagaries of life that they don’t ever think about their purpose at all. Then there’s the rest of you,” he said, looking out at the Ayramun, challenging them. Ayram caught it and said, “If there’s a purpose to this story, Mazid, you best get to it.”
“Most people make their family their purpose. The carpenter was such a man. His son was his purpose in life. To borrow a figurative turn from the poet Lovraleen, his son was his challenge to the nothingness inside him. And he lost. And worse, it wasn’t taken from him, it was squandered. If his son were killed, the man could have moved into grief, but no, the father had challenged the void and the void had answered back by corrupting his son and turning him into the living embodiment of a life’s wasted labor. At least, that’s how the father saw it. How could he see it differently? As Seb might say, the carpenter was who he was. And what did he do? He put his carpentry to work—he made a coffin and sent it with a messenger to his son. Inside that coffin was a note from the father which said, ‘You are going to die’. 
“To put it lightly, this message greatly disturbed the son. He might have been a wastrel, but a self-obsessed wastrel was he—he didn’t want to die. He saw the coffin and the note and was scared. He knew his father to be a man of resolve. He began to see his old man in every shadow. He couldn’t enjoy himself. He couldn’t go to the tavern, or the whorehouse, and he couldn’t sleep in the same place twice. This was no way to live, so what did he do? Since he was a wastrel he couldn’t confront even the thought of a confrontation, so he decided to run away and find a witch to fix his problem for him. If a witch could predict his future killing, then he could, he hoped, avoid it. 
“So, he found a karkoot lizard, stuck its stomach in a jar of brine, and set off to see the cantankerous old witch by the sea.
“When the wastrel finally set foot in the witch’s cave, he said to her, ‘My own father is trying to kill me. What should I do?’ Unfortunately for him, this was the wrong kind of question to ask, because the old witch dealt with facts, not advice. She wanted to hear questions like, ‘What will happen on the third full moon of the month?’, or, ‘When will the rains come?’, that sort of thing, not ‘What should I do?’. Whenever she was asked such a question, she’d put no effort into the answer. She smoked up, and she did a song and dance for the wastrel son, and when she was done she said to him, ‘When you leave this place, the first thought that enters your head is what you will do’.”
Seb asked, “Can you say that again?”
“Certainly. The witch said, ‘When you leave this place, the first thought that enters your head is what you will do’. It was obscenely ambiguous, but that was the point. You see, this witch was old and long in the trade, and she knew what kind of customer the boy was and how her response would weigh on him. It was her way of causing him torment. And torment him it did, for he jumped to the conclusion that his father was waiting for him outside the cave, and that the ‘first thought’ that would enter his head would be his father’s cudgel, and what he would ‘do’ was die. So he didn’t leave. He stayed right there in that witch’s cave and refused to leave.
“The witch’s plan had backfired. The witch tried in vain to shoo him out. She was stuck with this wastrel who was convinced that the moment he left her cave, he would be struck dead. The witch tried to tell him that his father couldn’t be sitting right outside her cave for all eternity, but the son didn’t buy it. It’s not that he thought his father was always watching the cave, but he believed with certainty that whenever he did decide to leave, that’s precisely when his father would show up.
“The witch eventually gave up trying to convince the boy that he could safely leave, and she told him that he could stay if he did chores for her, like scrubbing the cave floor, making fires, cooking, and whatnot. So the son stayed. After many, many years of this arrangement, the witch eventually died, and the carpenter’s son succeeded her because he had been, effectively, the witch’s apprentice. He had learned how to divine the future by watching the witch read the folds in fish stomachs. He had, on accident, become his own man with his own profession. The witch was dead, but people kept coming to the cave regardless. It is said that this wastrel’s divinations transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, for even kings would seek his sight to plan the courses of their wars.
“The great irony of all this is that the note the carpenter sent to his son was not a threat. If you remember, the note in the coffin said, ‘You are going to die’—that was a mere statement of fact, everybody dies. The father had no intention of hunting down his son. For the father, the knowledge of death is what spurred him to work hard and make the most of every moment, and he had hoped the thought would do the same for son, and it did. It is not known if the father ever discovered that his son had become a great diviner and shaped the course of history, but I like to think that the abatement of his despair would have been most sublime, for he had, unwittingly, triumphed against the void.” 
A silence set in around the smokeless fire. No one wanted to admit it, but the story wasn’t half-bad.
Mandri said, “I wonder if the witch knew that the wastrel son would become her successor.”
“Of course she did,” said Seb. “She’s a diviner. She divined the future and knew what to say to make it work. The idiot kid was as much her kid as the carpenter’s.”
Moteah said, “It’s part of the telling, Mandri, don’t think too much about it.”
“Well, it’s a poor telling.”
Obo’s eyes lit up. “You think you can do better?”
“I do.”
“Then let us hear it.”
“I know a story about a son. A godly son. Upright in his parent’s eyes and in Solraheen’s. That is, until the day he met a girl.”
“Typical,” Moteah groaned.
“It’s a good story,” Mandri protested. 
But nobody wanted to hear it. They all laid down to rest, leaving Mandri full of resentment. His story was one told to him when he was twelve. He still remembered the Solitant priest, a man with clean white hair, sweptback behind the ears, and Mandri still remembered how the priest upholstered his story with eloquence.
He spoke of seductive demonettes. 
They stroked a young man’s body in the most delicate of embraces
They fondled his uglies with their miscegenate appendages, so as to win a depraved victory over him.
It was a story inspired by the grace of Solraheen, and these Ayramun would love to hear it, for it was a story about how a Spark was saved from the ravages of union with the Dark. In the end, the young man never succumbed to this utmost of temptations—he bit off his tongue, and the incredible pain, coupled with the coldness of death, rescued him from his lust.</Text>

Elrahet cackled a laugh. 
“Really,” said Obo, “I’d love to know.”

            <Title>Goree Pass scratch</Title>
            <Text>No one moved save for Ayram, who unshouldered his great pack and tossed it to the floor.
Though the scribe was far away, all could see that in his hand was a sword, for he held it high, and the silver blade and golden guard caught the glare of the pre-noon sun. He barked some indiscernible word, and then, with a sweeping flourish, threw his sword onto the sand.
Moto saw the scribe’s sign and gaped in disbelief. “He wants to bargain?”
The Hrkan horn sounded out again.
BWEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooooooo
From around the Pass’s northern shelf came a column of white robed soldiers. At their head was a small child robed in black—the Mazidariga. They spread out into a line just behind the scribe.
Purl asked everyone, “What do we do?”
Obo perked up and said, “That Riga out there could have whistled out my will-less Spark by now, but it hasn’t. Those soldiers could be charging towards this tower, but they aren’t. There’s not much to read into this—these people actually mean to bargain.”
Moto asked, “Why?”
“The same reason anyone bargains—they think they have something to lose.”
Moteah said, “Maybe they think the Greskalun are here and on our side.”
“Your guess is as good as mine,” said Obo.
“Stay here, and stay hidden,” said Ayram. “I’m going to see what they want.”
He began to march through the tunnel and out of the gate, spear gripped tightly in hand. The Hrkan scribe, upon seeing Ayram marching out into the Sand, set his horse to trotting towards the tower.
Ayram paused a few yards outside the tower’s gate, forcing the scribe to cross the greater distance.
When the horse and rider finally neared the giant, Ayram laid down his spear. And though the scribe was high in his a saddle, they met almost eye to eye.
“Are you Greskal?” The rider asked, impressed at Ayram’s size.
“I am not.”
The answer took the scribe by surprise.
“Are you the master of this tower?”
Ayram glanced behind him and said, “This tower has no master. As you can see, it is empty, save for me and mine.”
The scribe’s horse was becoming fidgety. No doubt it had caught wind of the terror that lay in the courtyard. The scribe mistook it for fright at Ayram’s height.
The stern man said, “We know that the Mazidobo resides in this tower.”
“So it does,” said Ayram. 
“Then bring it forth. I wish to speak with it.”
“You can speak with me,” said Ayram gruffly. “I will pass your message along.”
The scribe frowned. “This is not the time for games,” he warned. “We found the body of the Mazidariga of Shuls out in the desert.”
“Is that so?”
“Tell me, has the Mazidobo lost its flame? We saw no scorch marks.”
“You are welcome to test that interpretation, should you wish.”
The scribe sneered and said, “We know the Mazidobo has acquired some means of reversing the Mazidariga’s charm. We know that it escaped the leash of his Minder. We wish to come to terms with it, so as to avoid any further loss of life.”
The scribe’s horse was growing more perturbed by the moment. Its eyes were wide and its nostrils flared and it kept trying to resettle its rider, as if preparing to bolt.
“Tell the Mazidobo, that as we speak, a battalion of Hrkan Skulsi marches into the eastern mouth of the Goree Pass. At their head is the Mazidurn. Behind me, as you can see, is a column of swords, and coming up from the south, from the Solgi, is the Mazidban, who shall be with us shortly. As such, you are all surrounded, and should it come to it, you will be overwhelmed. There is no way out excepting the event in which you and yours peaceably disarm yourselves, and the Mazidobo offers itself up into my charge. In exchange, all lives will all be spared, and the Mazidobo shall be allowed to retire from service after submitting to examination. We do not need violence here, nor do we want it. More than anything, we want the Mazidobo alive, for we wish to learn from its malfunction.”
“I don’t much like those terms,” Ayram said.
The scribe frowned and his horse bucked slightly, sharing its rider’s frustration.
“This is not a matter for you to decide,” the scribe said. “Bring my terms to the Mazidobo, or bring the Mazidobo and I’ll tell it myself.”
Ayram stroked his beard. He looked up at the sky, arced his shoulders, and he drew in a breath that could fill an ox’s stomach, enough air to think for a good long while. In the intervening silence, the scribe’s horse began to clip-clop its agitation, bouncing the scribe uncomfortably in his saddle.
“Settled down you crooked beast!”
He gave his horse a foul kick in the ribs.
Ayram finally said, “The Mazid and its Minder will only treat with their own kind.”
“The Mazidobo’s Minder is dead. His body was found two weeks ago in the Junei hills.”
“The Mazid has a new Minder. An old witch.”
The scribe’s brow jumped in surprise, and that quickly turned into elation. He mused, “That’s good. An unleashed Mazid would be no good for any of us. But if it will only speak to a Mazid, then we will have to wait, for the Mazidban will not be here for at least another hand.”
Ayram said, “The Mazidobo will treat with the Mazidariga.” He nodded towards the Hrkan line behind the scribe.
The scribe bit his lip in frustration. He looked up, took in the tower, then spied the long distance behind him.
“Fine,” he said. “But I won’t do this business in the shadow of this accursed place. We’ll meet where the tower’s shadow meets the light of Solraheen.”
With the sun approaching its noontime zenith, the tower’s shadow extended out into the desert a mere forty yards or so.
“Fair enough,” said Ayram.
Before the scribe and his horse ran off, he said,  “There’s no sense in playing me, poke. There’s nowhere to run if you resort to trickery.”
Ayram picked up his spear. The scribe sneered, then barked at his horse and yanked on the reins as he jabbed its flanks with his heels. Off they went galloping, back towards the Hrkan line.  
Ayram spun around, and nested inside his beard was the biggest of all possible smiles, considering the size of his head.
“Solraheen shines on us!” he declared as he stepped back into the tower’s tunnel. Moto was the first to greet him by saying, “This will be easier than I ever dreamed.”
Ayram nodded and said, “That scribe won’t know what hit him. Can you believe it!? Hrks think they’re gods when they’re stuck up on a horse. Who says the Goree is cursed?”
He marched over to his giant pack, untied the bindings that kept it shut, then lifted it up and dumped its contents on the floor.
“Split this up between you,” he said. “And make sure that everyone is ready to run.”
“Run where?” Seb asked.
Ayram said, “Once I strike that scribe down, we need to run. I’m not going to stop to help any of you get yourselves together, so if you’re not ready, if you fall behind, you’re forgotten.”
Ayram then stepped over to Mandri. He said, “Turn around,” and Mandri turned, and then Ayram pulled Obo out of the litter by his skull again, as if handling a melon.
Obo dangled in Ayram’s grip, looking like a pale worm. He said to Ayram, “You know, I could ruin this for you.”
Ayram’s mood soured at the suggestion.
“I’m not going to ruin it,” Obo said. “I just wanted you all to know that I could have.”
Ayram grunted and tossed Obo onto his emptied pack. Obo’s pale, bald head and bony arm were almost glowing in the tunnel dark, but most of all, his saucer eyes were bright and shining. They scanned the world for something, probably they were looking for something he could use to rescue himself. Mandri knew no rescue was coming and that, for Obo, this might be the end. Then those eyes settled on Mandri, and Mandri felt his stomach knot.
There was nothing he could do for Obo—and yet…and yet…odd that he should feel this way for so strange a face. Some mothers love children with faces much worse off than Obo’s, not that Mandri was feeling something so pure. It was just the sense of pity—Obo was going to be snuffed out for no other reason than he was what he was, and what a shame. Born almost yesterday, enslaved and tortured all his short life, quartered by desert bandits, and he was still holding out hope, still looking at Mandri like Mandri was important. 
Mandri had to look away. But he could not quell the budding sense that something was being uncovered here, and that was horrible, because as any self-watcher knows, finding things out about oneself is the worst kind of finding. And Obo was right there, and this was a permanent goodbye, Mandri knew it. Then that pang of pity came back fierce and welled up in his throat.
He could not speak for fear of sobbing.
He swallowed it down.
He glanced at Obo and the sob of pity rose again.
Then a small miracle occurred.
Seb, in an attempt to reorganize her pack’s interior to make room for a bundle-up lizard skin she’d found, pulled out a woolen blanket, and in so doing, she unwittingly pulled out her pouch of burgeons as well. The pouch hit the ground and out popped three beautiful God’s Eye burgeons. Two of them spiraled harmlessly in little circles, but one burgeon hit the ground rolling as if flicked towards Mandri’s toes by Solraheen Himself.
Mandri covered it up with his foot. When Seb finally noticed that her burgeons had spilled, she snatched them up, quick as a fox, none the wiser that she’d missed one.
The feeling of that burgeon under Mandri’s heel was brighter than any morning. Mandri didn’t even hear Obo’s final parting.
“Never let it be said that I didn’t do anything for you people.”
Moto yanked the L-frame litter right off Mandri’s back, because Moto had made a makeshift bag out of a blanket, and he’d filled that bag with the stuff that had tumbled out of Ayram’s pack—liquid skins, knotted ropes and strings, and odd-shaped dried mutton lumps wrapped in linen cloth.
Where had any of that meat been during the long journey through the Tib?
No matter.
There was God’s Eye under his foot.
But even this thought was not enough to last, for when Moto handed the litter back to Mandri, it was twice the weight that Obo ever was.</Text>

            <Title>Solgi Erg</Title>
            <Text>The evening sun brought them out of the sandstorm’s wake and onto solid clay. This was still officially part of the Sand’s Pitted Portion, though there were no pits. There were scraggly bushes and a few stunted trees with swirling trunks. Ayram propped his great pack up against one of these miniature trees, then lay up underneath it to squeeze in a short rest. He permitted Seb to build a smokeless fire. Mandri felt smart in reminding everyone that a Mazidariga didn’t need smoke to find them, and he was told that the Hrks were not the only people from which he needed to hide.
They sat around the fire, watching the sun set. They munched on hardtack, and Mandri was allowed a swig of wine that tasted like sour beets. They conversed about the terrain ahead and the difficulties they would face. Conversation eventually turned to the Great Solgi Erg. The Great Erg was not in their way, but fireside chattering about the Sand’s features cannot end without mentioning it. 
 Mandri made the mistake of calling it the Solgi Erg. 
“The Great Solgi Erg,” Moteah corrected.
“My apologies.”
“Plenty of ergs in the sand, only one of them is Great.”
Moto said, “Elrahet knows the story of the Erg’s creation.”
“No one knows the story,” said Elrahet, annoyed.
“But you said—”
“There are old memories, said to have come straight from the mouth of Solraheen—those are lies. No truth survives unscathed from the age when Solraheen shaped His voice into word, for that age was long before the age of signs and symbols. The story I know is one shaped by memory, and memory is one big belly-aching lie.”
“But what about—”
“Solraheen made those mountains of sand a long time ago,” Elrahet said, completely ignoring Moto’s stammering complaints. “That is all that can be said for the truth of the Great Erg. Everything else is in doubt. The very name is in doubt. You know those dunes as the Great Solgi Erg for you were brought up in this Solitant infested world, but those dunes have other names. Older names. Which is the true name? Who can say?”
Mandri admired the old woman’s stamina. She’d been walking all day, and here she was, charging through the telling of a story.
She said, “The Solitants claim that Solraheen planted a stick in the ground to mark one of His garden’s eight corners. Then he left to only-Sol-knows-where to measure out the rest of it. His passing along the surface of the earth kicked up the first wind, the Shulsai, and this wind circled the earth and came back around to puff upon that planted stick. 
“The Shulsai blew sand against the stick, and soon an egg of a sand dune was built up in the stick’s lee. Nine moons later, and that fledgling dune had grown up to swallow the stick whole. All it took was that one dune, and soon the Primal Erg was belly-full and rolling across the world, leaving littler ergs in its wake. It rolled all the way to the edge of land, and there it stopped. It has been bleeding into the sea ever since, half the size of what it once was. It is the first erg, the Great Solgi Erg.”
“Now Mandri,” Moto said when Elrahet began to nibble at the edge of a wafer of hardtack. “Do you think Solraheen meant to do it? Do you think He knew that after planting that stick in the ground, that a whole sand sea would swell up around it? Did He do it on purpose?”
“I don’t think Solraheen makes mistakes,” said Mandri.
“Yessss,” said Elrahet, hissing like a snake. “Yes, that’s what the Solitants say. They call it the Solgi Erg, and they call it that because it means Sol’s gift. Yet I heard it called the Great Solzima Erg, and zima means—do you know what it means? It means shame.
“It is called the Solzima, because if Solraheen had intended for the dunes to form, he would have built them with his own two hands as he did with everything else in his garden. And why should He want to turn fertile black earth into a mountain of useless sand? These Old Believers could not believe that Solraheen would wander off into the middle of the world and shape lakes that reflect the light of the divine, fill them with creatures of unfathomable grace and beauty, and yet, at the same time, leaving the Erg to struggle up on its own, a basic sameness of stuff with no redeeming qualities. All the erg did was procreate and ripple the wind. Hah! Same could be said for Hrks!
She settled into a deep and easy sneer and said, “Old Believers say that when Solraheen made it back around to the eastern rib of the world and saw the Erg standing there he fell into a deep despair. It would take a millennia to clean up those dunes, even for Him. So he created the Buggal wind to blow it away.”
“Well that’s not the story that I’ve been told,” said Mandri.
“Oh? You should see that terrifying dune for yourself and despair.”
“I have seen it. From the water.”
Elrahet chuckled. “From the water, he says. You’ve been bit by Solitants, boy. Yes, I know their story. See how Solraheen’s golden light shimmers across Sand, they say. And think of the variety! Tidal dunes in the lee of hills, echoing dunes on the windward side. Crescent dunes, snake dunes, crater dunes rimmed with grass. Go to the Empty Portion and marvel at the rows of arcing dunes marching out to the horizon, or the perfectly flat and straight ridges of the Seedra. Stripes, domes, lizardfeet, hairpins, scallops, stars, all varying in size in temperament to rival any family of flowers. 
“The dunes are pigment, the wind is the brush, and Solraheen’s mind is the hand which sets it all in motion. The Sand is alive, it moves and creates itself—they’re fond of saying that. They see the Sand as a Sparked being, alive as much as you and I—the Ergs drift across the desert, eat the rocks, and shit them out behind, the parts they can’t digest. You can hear the dunes howl if you stop and listen. And they say all this to sell a lie, they say all you need to do to change the world is to plant a leg in the sand, as Solraheen planted His stick, and the wave you create will become a mountain. It’s a hopeful message. I hope you don’t believe it.”</Text>

            <Title>Mandrameen</Title>
            <Text>A Solitant priest hears the word ‘white’ and he thinks of the pure white glow of the god Solraheen—a white so bright it bursts out of itself and splits softly into rays of red, green, and blue. A Hrkan man hears the word ‘white’ and he pictures the plain and stainless robes of Hrkan Lordship. An outland man hears ‘white’ and he thinks of sparkling salt pans, clouds, and sun-bleached bone. As it is with ‘white’, so it is with words, they mean different things to different people. It is some wonder then, that Solraheen would choose the medium of the word to create the world. He was there in the void, spoke one word, the world emerged, and people haven’t stopped arguing about the meaning of it all ever since.
‘Art’ is a particularly contentious word. Solitants say the word had a fixed meaning, back when artists were truly spiritual beings. But that was long ago, and in the ages since, the meaning of ‘art’ and ‘artist’ became confused, so much so that the heresy of ‘art’ as a means of personal expression pollutes the minds of many.
A Solitant sermon on ‘Art as Exegetical Instrument’ begins with the following questions:
What is art?
Who is an artist?
Who isn’t?
A painter, a sculptor, these are artists, yes, that’s reasonable to say, but a farmer? Can he be an artist too if he digs the dirt in a way that’s true to the Spark within himself? Give a man shovel, a field of dirt, time to think about it, friends to impress, and he’ll dig a pure expression of his innermost world—a hole as deep as he can manage. And this isn’t some nihilistic fling, it’s much simpler than that. It’s a hole. The Solitant would argue that if a man digging a pit into a field is an ‘artist’ then the word is as useless as an unmarked weight.
A sheep-shearer plying her shears is then an artist. 
A tax collector can be an artist if he’s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of greed. 
There is a need here, the Solitant argues, for a word with walls. The true artist, the divine instrument, must be held apart from the self-dwelling horde.
The Old Jandri word for ‘artist’ is lost to time, but there is a word in what’s left of that language fit for adoption—burshegee. Literally, burshegee means something like ‘fertile ground’, but in the Solitant tradition it means ‘true artist’. It doesn’t mean quite the same thing as ‘virtuoso’ because true artistry has almost nothing to do with what a person does, whether it be painting, pit-digging, sheep-shearing, or finessing balance sheets. Some true artists never make anything at all, yet true artists they remain because true artists, fertile ground, this is a state of mind. 
Such a mind is not necessarily noble, or righteous, or even intelligent. In fact, the mind of the true artist is often marked by comic excess—too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and so exaggerated is the sense of self that it becomes impossible to describe the person without resorting to sarcasm.
For example—Mandrameen was the humblest humble that ever humbled.
When asked what he did for a living, Mandrameen would say, “Nothing important. I paint things”, and then he’d add, “for whatever that is worth”. Then he’d strut around the grand Hrkan galleries and this charade of humility melted away because he could not hide his contempt for his contemporaries.
He’d stand in front of a painting and say, “This piece really moves me,” and then he’d make a show of walking away. All must bear witness to his mop of black hair as it flounced itself in time with his skinny, stiff-backed step.
Or he’d say, “I weep at every stroke,” and then he’d flash a knowing smile. 
He’d say these things directly to a fellow artist’s face if he could get to it. He didn’t think of it as mean-spirited because artists, like himself, were safe targets for playful derision. It wasn’t the person he was making fun of, it was their failed attempts to express themselves, and those are completely different things. He’d never go after the person, no. Artists are the best people. It takes the best kind of person to put themselves in front of others and push through the barbs. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to a life of sad obscurity.
Mandrameen would say to Vigram, “You haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.” Vigram’s crime? He’d said that he liked a painting that he shouldn’t have. Vigram’s wealth be damned, Mandri knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if, by some cosmic absurdity, he wasn’t correct in any of the literal, figurative, or spiritual senses, then ‘correctness’ did not belong to the domain of humanity. It was certainly out of Vigram’s reach. Old Vigram was not an artist, not even the hole-in-the-field kind. He’d made his fortune as a creditor. Meanwhile Mandrameen, when he was ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters.
And his were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brush strokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he’d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait the paint was amply applied via a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of thick umber on thin black he could define the chestnut skin, the high-arched cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, even the mood of the piece. One single stroke! He once painted a woman’s portrait using just twenty-four strokes—count them, twenty-four—and it was a true, vivid likeness. There were few extra nibbles here and there to make the eyes glisten and the cleavage heave, but those hardly counted. It didn’t stop Vigram from marveling at how young Mandrameen packed so much information into so few slips of paint.
“My dear Mandri,” Vigram would say, “These are the marks of genius!”
He’d say it often.
He paid Mandri for lessons.
This was something of a charity, for Mandri was twenty years old and despite his great talent in such a sacred discipline, he was inexplicably poor.
These lessons were given in Vigram’s countryside estate, a good way away from the must and crust of Meskalim. The days started with breakfast, where Vigram, a burly old man with a bald head and brown belly-beard that he kept oiled and trimmed, would push Mandri to explain why he hadn’t yet achieved success. Each week he’d put the question in a different way, but it was always about that same basic thing—why wasn’t Mandri swimming in money? Painters were richly rewarded throughout the Hrkan world. He should be swimming in money.
Mandri tried to explain that financial success, when it comes to art, has little to do with skill or quality. Novelty plays a role, but mostly it’s about preening tongues and critic’s pens. It’s about how many people knew the raw fact of your existence. Vigram always pushed back, and today Mandri settled the matter by declaring, in between mouthfuls of seared lizard lung, “I refuse to debase myself by doing what it takes to succeed.”
Vigram then regaled Mandri with the story of his own life, and he’d tell it in a way so as to suggest that accumulating wealth was the easiest thing in the world and that Mandri could do it too. Vigram had told the story so many times that Mandri could tell it right back.
First, inherit four ounces of silver. This may seem like an insurmountable obstacle for some, but if Vigram could do it, anyone could.
Next, loan those four ounces to two brothers who run a bakery. Make sure it's a bakery that supplies a Solitant temple with bread—that’s a surefire bet because temples are always the last thing the mob will burn down in lean times. The temple and the bakery brothers might accuse you of committing usury against Solraheen Himself, because you are, but if you get together with a priest and pray about it around a jug of beer and then flash him a slip of silver, the bleary shine will blind him.
After that, lend smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who need emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. Split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim’s bond market. There’s not much money in Meskalim itself, but it has a busy port and that means access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.
From there, it’s a simple matter of sprouting six more eyes, four more limbs, and now that you’ve become a human spider you’ll be able to spin a web of silver that stretches into every corner of the holy continent. The fools will walk right into the net of debt. The wiggling sticks them snug. You pick out the salvageable ones for your own use, and now you’ve got a little brood of spiders pouring over lists of sums credited and debts owed, and as long as you maintain a layer of abstraction between these creatures and your muscle, it’s all self-sustaining.
And that’s it. Now you have a comfortable life and idle hours to spend however you please.
“No debasement necessary,” Vigram added.
Mandri chowed down on the cold, crumbled chunks of what he supposed was black-sauced beef spleen. Most of Vigram’s breakfast foods were unfamiliar, as Vigram could afford to eat a different delicacy for every meal, every day of the week. He also had a chronic toothache, so he preferred foods that had to be scooped with sand clam shells and sauces that would stick to the roof of the mouth. This toothache also forced Vigram to talk out the side of his mouth in a wincing drawl.
“We’ve forgotten to pray,” he said.
Mandri set a clam shell down, bowed his head, and prepared himself to endure a Sparkless prayer that was more habitual than ritual. Vigram called, and Mandri responded.
“Bless this food,”
	“So that it can be,”
“Consumed by the body,”
	“So that it can,”
“Feed the Spark,”
	“So that it can,”
“Move the flesh,”
	“So that it can be,”
“Consumed by the body.”
Vigram wiped the grease off his fingers. “Now, Mandri,” he said. “You know all about art. And that’s why I respect you so much. But I know all about money, and at a certain point you have to join them up, because the world doesn’t work how it should. The world works how it works. You have to make a living.”
Mandri wolfed down a peach-jellied egg, then meekly agreed. He would have told Vigram what he really thought, but he really, really, needed Vigram’s money.
Vigram clapped his meaty hands and a nameless slave came in and took their plates. Then the two of them headed out to Vigram’s vine-trellised, brown-brick patio, where Vigram set himself to work in setting up a canvas and an easel which he claimed to have built himself—slaves cut and planed the lumber, brewed the glue, hammered the metal fittings, but mighty Vigram did the rest.
Mandri said, “Are you sure you want to do this here?”
“Why not?” asked Vigram. “Is there something wrong?”
“No. There’s nothing wrong, exactly. It’s that this light is going to make things so much more difficult.”
The patio’s roof was not yet thick enough with vines, and that meant a richly dappled light would fall upon the sitter.
Vigram shook his head, which sent his great brown beard wiggling as if it were alive. “My dear Mandri,” he said, letting his drawl roll heavy. “The patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.”
“Well, you can worry about ‘magical vestures’ when you’re good enough to make a face look like a face.”
“No,” said Vigram. “I won’t have it any other way. A magical vesture for a magical subject.”
As if bidden from the heavens by Vigram’s words, his daughter, Lora, joined them on the patio. She was Vigram’s favorite subject, Mandri’s age, the only one of Vigram’s five children willing to sit for him. 
“Isn’t she a subject fit for holy oils?” Vigram asked.
“Undoubtedly,” said Mandri as his eyes flicked to Lora without intention, though Vigram interpreted it, as he always did, as the most rabid of intentions. The old man’s eyes squeezed out a suggestive smile, as if to give Mandri his patriarchal blessing.
Mandri pretended he didn’t notice.
Lora was good natured, comely, with clear brown skin and sun-kissed cheeks. She was also a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen lowing in the adjacent field. Many a young man would leap at the chance to be with such a fertility goddess, unfortunately Mandri didn’t want to have children.
“Help her up,” Vigram commanded. “I’ll ready the canvas and paint.”
Mandri did as he was told and helped Lora up onto a high-legged stool. Lora let her fingers linger on his arm. Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his muse.
Again, Mandri did as he was told and took up his post behind the old man.
Vigram snatched up a stick of soft charcoal and put down his first exploratory marks. This was always always the most difficult phase. Every work of art has to be built on a firm foundation. Get it wrong and everything that comes after will be wrong as well. Unfortunately for Vigram, he had that all-too-common beginner’s habit of refusing to use his god-damned brain. He started drawing wherever his hand randomly landed and what happened next was up to Solraheen. The end result was that Lora’s head was, somehow, too small. It was also too left-of-center. There’d be an awkward expanse behind her flower-studded curls.
“Hold on,” said Mandri. “You’re moving too fast. Don’t think of this as a portrait—not yet. All we have right now is an oval, a rectangular canvas, and where that oval sits on the canvas. All you’re doing is putting an oval on the canvas.”
“Right.”
“So think about where’s the best place to put that oval. Make use of the whole canvas.”
“Yes, yes you’re right.”
Vigram rubbed the marks away with his palm.
He stepped back.
He studied Lora.
He stepped again to the canvas.
Then he scratched a black oval right back where it had been.
“Is that better?” he asked with all the awareness of a potted plant.
“It needs to be a little bigger, I think.”
Vigram drew the oval again, but only slightly larger. Mandri encouraged the old man to continue, and from then on, almost every mark Vigram made was accompanied by a look back to Mandri for reassurance. 
“Don’t look at me, look at her.”
“I need to know if it is right or if it is wrong.”
“Assume that it’s always wrong, and then try to figure out why it’s wrong, and then fix it.”
There was a glimmer of understanding in Vigram’s eye, but as soon as it came it faded. He twirled his beard between his fat fingers, then asked, “If the mark I make is always wrong, then how could I ever move past it? I’ll be redrawing the same line over and over again.”
“You move on when you want to move on.”
“Then I want to move on. I’m here to paint, not draw.”
“Well, hold on. Finish…finish the basic shapes, at least.”
“Alright.”
Vigram ‘finished’ the ‘basic shapes’. He looked to Mandri for final approval.
“It’s your paint,” Mandri said with a shrug. “But you need to understand the importance of the drawing.”
“I do understand. You talk about it all the time.” Vigram tossed his charcoal over his shoulder and squealed with delight as he picked up his favorite brush.
Mandri watched on in confusion as Vigram threw down the first splotches of color in a flurry. The man was building an affront to the senses, and Mandri was getting paid to witness it. And he couldn’t deny a glance or two in Lora’s direction, for she was the sitter. Whenever his eyes wandered over to her, her smile would perk up. 
“Mandri, stop flirting with my daughter.”
Vigram hid himself behind the canvas and gave Mandri a knowing nod and encouraging smile.
“I’m not flirting,” said Mandri. “I’m checking proportions.”
“And how are her proportions?” Vigram’s eyebrows jumped suggestively. Lora, for her part, squirmed in her seat, blushing in feigned embarrassment, loving the attention.
Mandri said, “Vigram, let’s focus on your painting.”
“What’s wrong with it?”
Mandri paused to give Vigram time to refocus his energy into the task at hand. Mandri knew what was wrong with the piece—he could write a treatise on it. He also knew that Vigram wouldn’t be able to handle an unvarnished critique. If the man got upset, then there’d be no more money, and Mandri really, really needed the money. Mandri was forced to compromise with himself and exercise restraint. He had to do what everyone else does—start off with a disarming compliment. Pick out a positive to open the student up to critique. The problem, at present, was that there was literally nothing good there on canvas.
“It’s good,” said Mandri.
He leaned back, sank into his hip and made every honest effort to study the mishmash that Vigram was putting down. Unfortunately, Vigram had that other beginner’s habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes—while that can be done, it's a very dangerous thing to do. Oils dry too slowly to mess around. 
“Vigram…”
“I know, I know.”
“I’m gonna say it anyway. You need to get the color correct on the palette before it touches the canvas. That’s what the palette is there for.” 
Vigram nodded, then began his work again in earnest, and the morning dragged on.
Eventually Vigram’s assault reached his daughter’s chin and he mixed a bluish shade of bronze. Unless there was some extraordinary circumstance of light and shadow—which there wasn’t—it was a color meant for the chin of a Jandri man who keeps a close shave. Vigram slapped it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes darted between his daughter and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips curled into a frown and he muttered, “That’s not quite right.” He gave Mandri a sheepish grin, then he stabbed his brush into a slug of white, and he rubbed it into that manly chin.
“That’s not quite right either.” 
This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.
“It’s not bad,” he said.
The charcoal guidelines looked like they were bleeding pus.
One of those leafy shadows had drifted over Lora’s left eye, and Vigram had an amusing go at it—it looked like a bandit’s eye-patch. 
“It’s good,” said Mandri. “No really, I mean it. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s… it’s on the path.”
“It does not do justice to such a fine daughter,” said Vigram.
Mandri tapped his bottom lip as Vigram stepped aside to let him fully into the work.
Mandri said, “Do you remember what I said last week?”
“You said that I need to study hands.”
“And have you done that?”
“Nope!”
Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. He had avoided the hands altogether. Under Mandri’s supervision, Vigram attempted to paint them. It was like watching a child stir food around on their plate, and when Vigram pulled his brush away, there were no hands, there were two bundles of sticks sticking.
Mandri gave a meager smile to encourage the man. “The only things that matter are the face and the hands,” he said. He was struggling to stay useful. “You could give Lora a hundred ribs and a single breast and people will forgive you for it, so long as you’ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, anatomically correct hands.”
“I’ll do better with the hands.”
Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his frustrated brow. This whole ordeal was a waste of time. If he didn’t need that money so damned bad, he’d have quit after the first session.
His little reverie was interrupted when Lora jumped from the stool, crying out, “Mandri’s ox is eating the apples!”
She pointed an accusing finger to the hill beyond the trellis. All eyes peered through the vines, where some twenty yards away stood Mandri’s one true possession—a skinny yellow ox named Gil. Gil was craning his head up high to reach a sweet red apple. His long pink tongue was stuck out and twirling, but all it was doing was batting the ripened fruit around in circles.
Vigram turned to Mandri, “Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?”
“Gil has a right to go where he wants,” Mandri said firmly.
“Well he’s not got a right to my apples! If that ox eats anything that’s not already on the ground, I’ll have my man butcher it up. Now get the beast tied up.”
“Where are you going?”
“I’m going to pick out wine for brunch. Lora, my sweet, help the boy clean up. I’ll call you both when refreshment is ready.”
Old Vigram set his brush down, wiped his charcoal-stained fingers on an untouched corner of the canvas, and then plodded off, leaving Mandri trapped on the patio with Lora.
Lora slid off her stool and sauntered over to Mandri, where her intrepid hand brushed the back of his arm. “I can help you,” she said. “I know how to catch animals.”
“Gil is not an animal,” said Mandri. “His Spark’s as bright as yours or mine.”
“He’s an ox, Mandri.”
“I’m serious. Watch…” Mandri turned to Gil, and out of her reach. “Gil!” he shouted. “Gil, C’mere!”
Gil’s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. His protuberant eyes stared back through the vines, a dumb, bovine ogle. Slobber dripped unheeded from his lower lip. 
“Gil!”
Gil blinked, then got distracted by the long grass brushing his belly. He bit off a mouthful and began to chew.
“Gil! Hup!”
This startled Gil into motion, sending him trotting towards the patio. The flap of his heavy dewlap rolled his short-hair hide back and forth over his sagging, aged spine.
“Poor old creature,” Lora muttered.
“Ah, he’s fine,” Mandri said.
Gill clopped onto the patio as if it were his living room.
Lora hid herself behind Mandri in mock fright. It was enough of an excuse for her to squeeze Mandri’s scrawny shoulders and press herself against him.
“You don’t need to be scared of Gil,” said Mandri. “He’s the nicest old ox you’ll ever meet. He likes a good scratch right between the eyes. See?” He stepped aside, out of Lora’s grasp, and stepped to greet Gil. 
Lora ventured hesitantly towards Gil, and Gil let her scratch him into a cooing moo.
She said, “He’s a sweet thing, isn’t he?”
“He is. But not as sweet as Vigram’s painting.”
Lora eyed her father’s painting and stifled a smile, but the depiction of her was so ridiculous that her smile grew bigger and bigger, until she finally broke out in laughter.
“He’s turned me into a demon,” she said. “It’s the hands, they look like claws.”
“I try to tell him…hands require practice.”
Lora sidled up to Mandri, grabbed his hand and said, with all the lust and must of a woman in heat, “Artists need strong and dexterous hands, don’t they?” 
“Uh…No…well, yes, but, uh… I don’t have any, uh, dexterity. I actually haven’t painted anything in years.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Lora. “We’ve seen you paint.”
“Demonstrations, sure, but those don’t really count.” 
“Then what have you been doing up on that little farm of yours?”
“Farming.”
Lora rolled her eyes. “Look at you,” she said. “You’ve never farmed a day in your life.”
“I’m not lying.”
Lora stepped closer and purred, “Then why don’t you paint anymore?”
“Uh…it would be too hard to explain.” Mandri tore himself away from Lora yet again and tried to busy himself with Vigram’s mess. There was enough untouched pigment left on the palette for four more portraits. He moved to scrape a slap of yellow back into its little clay jar.
“Try to explain it,” said Lora.
“Well, painting is, uh...”
Mandri tried to think of a palatable excuse, then he realized it was sitting right in his hands. “It’s too expensive. I mean, look at all this pigment. The canvas. At this point in my life it’d take me weeks to afford all this. Your father makes this in half a day.”
“You could make that much too if you came and worked for him.”
“I’m not good with money.”
“All you’d be doing is signing a scrap of paper every now and again.”
Lora picked up a dirty brush and twirled its horse-hair head through the muddy colors of the palette.
She said, “You know, he doesn’t actually care about learning to paint. The only reason he pays for these lessons is because you would starve if he didn’t. He likes you. I like you.” She batted her eyes and tried to catch him staring.
“Is that how he feels about it?” Mandri asked. “Well I don’t need charity.”
Lora sighed. “Mandri, I’ve seen your farm. My dad’s seen your farm. Everybody’s seen your farm. It’s not a farm.”
“It’s a farm to me. And it’s a farm to Gil. Isn’t that right, Gil?”
He turned to the animal, but Gil wasn’t even on the patio. He’d snuck his way back up the hill to lick at that damned apple.
Lora rolled the handle of the paintbrush in between her fingers. She said, “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
“What?”
“They say that you’re a eunuch.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
“An old woman came looking for you. She said you were a eunuch, too.”
“A woman came here just to tell you I’m a eunuch?”
“She called you a gaburshegee. She said that means eunuch, and she was looking for you.”
“When?”
“Yesterday.”
“Well she couldn’t have been looking for me, because I’m not a eunuch.”
“Prove it.”
Mandri’s jaw dropped. 
“What?”
Lora crossed her arms and gave Mandri a sly, expectant look. “I’m a woman, Mandri. What’s your problem?”
“I’m not going to pull my uglies out just to prove they’re there.”
Mandri believed this would be enough to put her off, but Lora was a girl trained in the art of bashful men. She saw right through him and made her move, grabbed his arm and pulled him close. She caught his eyes and forced him to confront her lilac scent, her pounding heat, her smooth skin, her honeyed, aching lips.
“Lora…” 
Mandri knew he had to be very careful here.
“You’re a beautiful girl, but—”
“But what? You go in for men?”
“No!—no.”
“I could be good for you,” she said.
“And what do you get out of it?”
She squeezed herself against him and her warmth was overwhelming.
“You could be good for me,” she said. 
“You would not say that if you really knew me.”
“What’s there to know? You’re just a boy.”
Mandri’s eyes widened at the sight of her inviting smile, and the soft shadows of the vines overhead just so happened to frame her sparkling brown eyes with the most magnificent golden light. A magical vesture indeed. 
He nearly broke. He probably would have too if Gil hadn’t reached his apple and let out a triumphant bellow. 
“MMMMRRRRUUUUUooooooooooOOOOOOOoooo!”
Gil’s roar was so loud and sickly that it startled Mandri and Lora out of their awkward embrace.
Mandri backed up against the vines.
“Lora, this is not what I’m here for.”
“It’s what I’m here for,” said Lora.
Mandri looked for a means of escape and his eyes stumbled over one of the house’s misty window panes, behind which Vigram’s bearded face was smiling so wide it seemed he was about to stamp a return on interest.
“Okay. I’m leaving.”
Mandri practically leaped off the patio.
Lora shouted after him, “What is wrong with you?”
Mandri did not answer. There was no point in answering. This was not what he was here for. He ran, then jogged, then walked, then stopped when he realized that he was forgetting something.
“Gil!”
But Gil was already trotting down the gentle hill to follow. Mandri waited up, and together they headed for the estate’s swing gate.
Vigram was on their heels, marching fast with his robe hiked up and his long beard tucked under his arm.
“What happened!?” he shouted.
“Nothing,” said Mandri. “I’m leaving.”
“You’re leaving?”
“Look, Vigram, I don’t want to be a bother, but could I get the money?”
Vigram frowned. He reached into his robe and pulled out a small brown sack of coin. He held it in the air as if to lure Mandri back towards the house.
He said, “Lora thinks you’re using this money to buy burgeons from Geem.”
“Burgeons?” asked Mandri.
“You deny it?”
“What would Lora know?”
“Do you deny it?”
“Of course I deny it.”
Vigram eyed Mandri with suspicion, then he shook the bag of coin and said, “I want you to promise me that you’re not going to use this money to buy burgeons.”
“I promise.”
Vigram looked down his nose at Mandri and scratched his beard. He said, “I’m going to give you this money because I owe it. If I find out you’re using this for burgeons, then our arrangement here is finished. You won’t be coming back. And for Sol’s sake, buy some apples for this creature of yours.”
“I will.”
Vigram put the bag in Mandri’s palm, and Mandri tucked it into his robe.
“You’ve got the gift of the brush, Mandri. Solraheen’s given you a gift. It’s a sacred gift.”
“I know. I’ll see you later.”
Mandri and Gil walked out the gate. 
“I’m serious!” Vigram called out. “You’ve been given a gift!”
Mandri waved back.
It wasn’t a gift, not a special one, at least. He could paint a portrait in twenty-four strokes, but few would be impressed if they watched him do it. He would spend hours and hours making those single strokes. He’d put one down, and if it wasn’t exactly right, he’d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and he’d repeat this for as long as it took. Days. A week. Longer. Had to wait for the paint to dry. People only ever saw the finished product, those twenty-four strokes, and upon seeing it they assumed that Mandri’s brush went slip-slap-boom and there’s a true likeness. That story couldn’t be further from the truth. Mandri’s real talent was his tolerance of tedium, and that’s a talent a person can lose—Mandri was living proof. 
When he and Gil got to the top of the big hill that overlooked Vigram’s estate, he took one last look back. Vigram was still standing in his drive. The old man waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, “No burgeons!”
“Yeah, yeah,” Mandri muttered under his breath.
“They’ll douse your Spark!”
Mandri waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem’s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. They were Down-Valley burgeons, decent stuff but the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle so they’d split too quickly and the insides would dry out before Mandri could get to them. But that was all Geem had so he bought them. 
Mandri and Gil continued along the road, stomping their way through the muddy wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, humming and mooing nursery rhymes until they made it back Mandri’s farm. There he could finally relax and lose all sense of himself in the deep and blessed bliss brought on by beer spiked through with burgeons.</Text>

            <Text>The manifesto states that the public largely accepts individual technological advancements as purely positive without accounting for their overall effect, which includes the erosion of local and individual freedom and autonomy. While originally regarded as a thoughtful critique of modern society, with roots in the work of academic authors such as Jacques Ellul, Desmond Morris, and Martin Seligman,[3] Kaczynski's 1996 trial polarized public opinion around the essay, as his court-appointed lawyers tried to justify their insanity defense around characterizing the manifesto as the work of a madman, and the prosecution lawyers rested their case on it being produced by a lucid mind. 

Humans adapt to machines instead of the other way around

But that is how its always been! Humans adapt to the enviornment. It has always been this suffering. What we go through is no different. Species of creatures, models of the world are being extinguished at monumental rates. It is no different. Except for those who break the cycle. The stoic.

Industrial Society and Its Future echoes contemporary critics of technology and industrialization such as John Zerzan, Jacques Ellul,[21] Rachel Carson, Lewis Mumford, and E. F. Schumacher.[22] Its idea of the &quot;disruption of the power process&quot; similarly echoed social critics who emphasize that the lack of meaningful work is a primary cause of social problems, including Mumford, Paul Goodman, and Eric Hoffer.[22] Aldous Huxley addressed its general theme in Brave New World, to which Kaczynski refers in his text. Kaczynski's ideas of &quot;oversocialization&quot; and &quot;surrogate activities&quot; recall Sigmund Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents and its theories of rationalization and sublimation (a term which Kaczynski uses three times to describe &quot;surrogate activities&quot;).[23] 

&quot;philosophical criminal of exceptional intelligence and humanitarian purpose ... driven to commit murder out of an uncompromising idealism&quot; 

After Ted Kaczynski's April 1996 arrest, he wanted to use the trial to disseminate his views,[8] but the judge denied him permission to represent himself. Instead, his court-appointed lawyers planned an insanity defense that would discredit Industrial Society and Its Future against his will. The prosecution's psychiatrists counter-cited the manifesto as evidence of the Unabomber's lucidity, and Kaczynski's sanity was tried in court and in the media.

            <Text>When humanity was young and most were living in dens like lizards, the people who called themselves the Solgruin were building civilization. They built the first canals and the first sustenance fields, and they measured these fields six by one against the banks of the Solket river, all plotted out in the first cadastral texts. They domesticated the first plow oxen, grew the first harvests, relished in the first age of plenty, and this was all followed by the first catastrophic drought, and then the first stretch of worn-out land, and then came the first law of fallow. This was all a long, long time before rest of Old Jandri toddled to its feet, and it was a time that history would have forgot if not for the fires that burned Solgruin’s city down, for among the buildings burned that day was a warehouse that held thousands of scribal tablets whose clay was set to be repurposed for practical use. The fire baked those tablets into bricks for once and for all, and so an accidental library survived the crumbling ruin. One of the stories that survived  was the story of the creation of the Goree Pass.
One day, Solgruin petitioners went to the temple of Solraheen, for He dwelt among them then, and outside the veil of His bedchamber, they sang their complaint to Him in structured verse—it was proper etiquette to address the Creator with song, even if all you were doing was complaining about how the Goree mountains were too difficult to hike. The Solgruin were set on the western side of the Goree, and eastern Jandri wasn’t far away by land, yet because of the Goree’s impenetrable physique the only way to get there was by boat, a five day journey around the southern horn. The ferrymen charged extortionate prices. It was too great a burden. The petitioner’s song ended by requesting, humbly, for Solraheen to part the mountains and join the two halves of the Jandri world.
When Solraheen asked why they would want to go to eastern Jandri, and the Solgruin were too ashamed to answer, for it was gold that they sought. Solraheen had seen through their pretensions and denied their request.
A few hundred years later, the Solgruin forgot that Solraheen refused their forebears, and they went to Him a second time to ask, humbly, if He might part the mountains. This generation was more honest in their request, as they made clear their desires—they wanted to walk their caravans into eastern Jandri, that they might trade with the budding cities of Jeket, Shagota, and Zos.
Again, Solraheen denied them.
Time passed, the Solket river dwindled,and the Solgruin’s crops failed, and worse—Solraheen dwelt there for only one month out of every year. Again, a new generation rose up and went before Him and asked if He might part the mountains.
This third time, Solraheen answered with action. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there he stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
Yet the Solgruin did not rejoice, for when Solraheen showed them what he’d done, He said to them, “Look upon this scar which mars My creation and lament your selfish ways. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed and so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
This story is taught in every Solitant church because the story’s true lesson is not obvious, and the process of discovering that lesson is meant to be a stepping stone to prepare inquiring minds for the more unintuitive theologies, where common sense and logic will only arrive at the incorrect conclusions. On the surface it seems the story is straightforward—it warns against self-centeredness. That’s how a child understands the story—it’s a warning to never put your own desires above Solraheen’s, else you might become cursed. 
But that understanding was wrong.

Selfishness is good.
This might tangle up the quest to abolish the self, but again, logic and reason are deceitful things.
A venerable old priest tried to explain it to young Mandri once.
“You are making a category error,” he said. “Our Spark’s desires are Solraheen’s desires. We are His tools, and a tool is an expression of purpose. So long as they are not your desires, but your Spark’s desires, you are free to be as selfish as you wish.”
Mandri would have asked how the old man distinguished between the two, and why the old man’s Spark felt compelled to visit a whore house every evening, but he was too young then to see through the masks of the elderly.


“This is rock vomit,” said Seb. He was walking alongside Mandri and Obo. His gums squelched on a borcandi spine. “Solraheen punched the gut of the mountain, and the mountain spat these big rocks out. Can ya believe it? Like pissin’ stones.”
“You have a peculiar talent for imagery,” said Obo as he bounced along in his litter.

If that tower had a truer name than ‘Western Tower’, Mandri did not catch it among the nervous whispers of the Ayramun.
“All the same, the Hrks didn’t do it. The Goree pass is not yet in sight of the Hrkan Lords.”
Purl snapped at that remark and said, “Everything is in sight of the Lords.”
“Maybe so,” Obo sighed. “But I don’t suppose that any of you have an appreciation for how much grain it takes to sustain a fortification of that size? This surrounding area isn’t exactly fertile land, is it? If any of you were students of history, you might know that anytime there’s a drought in the river plain to the south, this tower is the first to feel it. I suspect that’s what’s happened here—the Greskalun began to starve and simply moved on to greener pastures.”
Elrahet stirred from where she leaned against a boulder. The journey had truly worn her down. Her words came from her throat against their words. “Gresh—hghhmmm—Greskal would not abandon the pass,” she said.
“As may be,” Obo said, “But hunger makes people act out of character.”
“Greskal’s line has a sacred duty. They would not leave.”
Obo looked at Elrahet with a challenging glare. “What do you think a person is willing to do when hunger sets in?”
Ayram, still squatting and staring intently at the Mazid’s visage, said, “Greskal and his kin aren’t soft-bellied Hrks. They know hunger. They know suffering.”
“Then you should have no issue accepting that ‘soft-bellied Hrks’ would never come for a place like this. If there was an extensive system of support, perhaps…

He pointed to a purplish discoloration nearer the joint. “See this splotch here? This bone is not old.”
“So what?” Seb said. “A recent killing. It doesn’t explain why a thousand somethin’ Greskalun are missing.”

Mandri had to stop himself from saying that there were, indeed, many other kinds. People could be demons, that’s not an uncommon figure of speech. People could have done this. Or, people infested with demons, that’s not unheard of either. A demon demon, a real demon, yes he’d seen one, but a crowd of them rollicking around on the surface and snatching up innocent Sparks, that was the kind of thing that belonged to bygone ages and bedtime stories.
Mandri looked for holes in the courtyard floor where winged demonic terrors might have come bursting up through brick, but there were none. There was no cackling laughter in the distance, no claw-marks, no hoof-prints. He wanted to point all of this out and demand that Elrahet recant her claim, but what kind of person would he be then, to correct a witch on the matter of demons? 
Only Seb shared his questioning posture.
“Ain’t no demons,” Seb muttered.
“Seb,” said Moteah, voice threaded with hostility. “If you don’t think that demons did this, then that’s proof enough that they did.”

Mandri willed himself to look closer. The man’s wounds were quite peculiar. The rubbed raw skin on the outside of his thigh, for example, was no mere abrasion. Lighter pink rings of fresh skin circumscribed a freshly festering, leaking scab.
Fresh skin…
Freshly grown…
Well, the flesh might still be alive, but Mandri had seen a chicken running without a head before.
He took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered, his head jerked back and his tongue reached out of his open mouth, trying to find the slightest sip of a breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs.
“MANDRI! STOP!”
Mandri froze.
The command had come from Elrahet.

Elrahet’s knobby finger was pointing at a thin line of blood sprinkled on the ground. It was fresh blood, blood that should have seeped into the brick and stained it, or otherwise been lapped up by the sun, and yet there it was, ravishing red, and it ran in a circle around the pilgrim’s pole.
The toe of Mandri’s shoe was almost touching it.
He jumped back.
Everyone was staring at him like he’d put that pilgrim up on that pole himself.
“Would that have been bad?” he asked, pointing at the bloody circle.
“No,” said Elrahet, “It would not have been a great loss.”
With that she turned and began to hobble back into the tunnel. When no one made an immediate move to follow, she stopped and said, “We’re leaving.”</Text>

            <Title>Mandrameen</Title>
            <Text>A Solitant priest hears the word ‘white’ and he thinks of the pure white glow of the god Solraheen—a white so bright it bursts out of itself and splits softly into rays of red, green, and blue. A Hrkan man hears the word ‘white’ and he pictures the plain and stainless robes of Hrkan Lordship. An outland man hears ‘white’ and he thinks of sparkling salt pans, clouds, and sun-bleached bone. As it is with ‘white’, so it is with words, they mean different things to different people. So it is some wonder that Solraheen would choose the medium of the word to create the world. He was there in the void, spoke one word, the world emerged, and people haven’t stopped arguing about the meaning of it all ever since.
‘Art’ is a particularly contentious word. Solitants say the word had a fixed meaning, back when artists were truly spiritual beings. But that was long ago, and in the ages since, the meaning of ‘art’ and ‘artist’ became confused, so much so that the heresy of ‘art’ as a means of personal expression pollutes the minds of many.
A Solitant sermon on ‘Art as Exegetical Instrument’ begins with the following questions:
What is art?
Who is an artist?
Who isn’t?
A painter, a sculptor, these are artists, yes, that’s reasonable to say, but a farmer? Can’t he be an artist too if he digs the dirt in a way that’s true to the Spark within himself? Give a man shovel, a field of dirt, time to think about it, friends to impress, and he’ll dig a pure expression of his innermost world—a hole as deep as he can manage. And this isn’t some nihilistic fling, it’s much simpler than that. It’s a hole. The Solitant will argue that if a man digging a pit into a field is an ‘artist’ then the word is as useless as an unmarked weight.
A sheep-shearer plying her shears is then an artist. 
A tax collector can be an artist if he’s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of greed. 
There is a need here, the Solitant argues, for a word with walls. The true artist, the divine instrument, must be held apart from the self-dwelling horde.
The Old Jandri word for ‘artist’ is lost to time, but there is a word in what’s left of that language fit for adoption—burshegee. Literally, burshegee means something like ‘fertile ground’, but in the Solitant tradition it means ‘true artist’. It doesn’t mean quite the same thing as ‘virtuoso’ because true artistry has almost nothing to do with what a person does, whether it be painting, pit-digging, sheep-shearing, or finessing balance sheets. Some true artists never make anything at all, yet true artists they remain because true artists—fertile ground—this is a state of mind. 
Such a mind is not necessarily noble, or righteous, or even intelligent. In fact, the mind of the true artist is often marked by comic excess—too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and so exaggerated is the sense of self that it becomes impossible to describe the person without resorting to sarcasm.
For example—Mandrameen was the humblest humble that ever humbled.
When asked what he did for a living, Mandrameen would say, “Nothing important. I paint things”, and then he’d add, “for whatever that is worth”. Then he’d strut around the grand Hrkan galleries and this charade of humility melted away because he could not hide his contempt for his contemporaries.
He’d stand in front of a painting and say, “This piece really moves me,” and then he’d make a show of walking away. All must bear witness to his mop of black hair as it flounced itself in time with his skinny, stiff-backed step.
Or he’d say, “I weep at every stroke,” and then he’d flash a knowing smile. 
He’d say these things directly to a fellow artist’s face if he could get to it. He didn’t think of it as mean-spirited because artists, like himself, were safe targets for playful derision. It wasn’t the person he was making fun of, it was their failed attempts to express themselves, and those are completely different things. He’d never go after the person, no. Artists are the best people. It takes the best kind of person to put themselves in front of others and push through the barbs. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to a life of sad obscurity.
Mandrameen would say to Vigram, “You haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.” Vigram’s crime? He’d said that he liked a painting that he shouldn’t have. Vigram’s wealth be damned, Mandri knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if, by some cosmic absurdity, he wasn’t correct in any of the literal, figurative, or spiritual senses, then ‘correctness’ did not belong to the domain of humanity. It was certainly out of Vigram’s reach. Old Vigram was not an artist, not even the hole-in-the-field kind. He’d made his fortune as a creditor. Meanwhile Mandrameen, when he was ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters.
And his were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brush strokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he’d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait the paint was amply applied via a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of thick umber on thin black he could define the chestnut skin, the high-arched cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, even the mood of the piece. One single stroke! He once painted a woman’s portrait using just twenty-four strokes—count them, twenty-four—and it was a true, vivid likeness. There were few extra nibbles here and there to make the eyes glisten and the cleavage heave, but those hardly counted. It didn’t stop Vigram from marveling at how young Mandrameen packed so much information into so few slips of paint.
“My dear Mandri,” Vigram would say, “These are the marks of genius!”
He’d say it often.
He paid Mandri for lessons.
This was something of a charity, for Mandri was twenty years old and despite his great talent in such a sacred discipline, he was inexplicably poor.
These lessons were given in Vigram’s countryside estate, a good way away from the must and crust of Meskalim. The days started with breakfast, where Vigram, a burly old man with a bald head and brown belly-beard that he kept oiled and trimmed, would push Mandri to explain why he hadn’t yet achieved success. Each week he’d put the question in a different way, but it was always about that same basic thing—why wasn’t Mandri swimming in money? Painters were richly rewarded throughout the Hrkan world. He should be swimming in money.
Mandri tried to explain that financial success, when it comes to art, has little to do with skill or quality. Novelty plays a role, but mostly it’s about preening tongues and critic’s pens. It’s about how many people knew the raw fact of your existence. Vigram always pushed back, and today Mandri settled the matter by declaring, in between mouthfuls of seared lizard lung, “I refuse to debase myself by doing what it takes to succeed.”
Vigram then regaled Mandri with the story of his own life, and he’d tell it in a way so as to suggest that accumulating wealth was the easiest thing in the world and that Mandri could do it too. Vigram had told the story so many times that Mandri could tell it right back.
First, inherit four ounces of silver. This may seem like an insurmountable obstacle for some, but if Vigram could do it, anyone could.
Next, loan those four ounces to two brothers who run a bakery. Make sure it's a bakery that supplies a Solitant temple with bread—that’s a surefire bet because temples are always the last thing the mob will burn down in lean times. The temple and the bakery brothers might accuse you of committing usury against Solraheen Himself, because you are, but if you get together with a priest and pray about it around a jug of beer and then flash him a slip of silver, the bleary shine will blind him.
After that, lend smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who need emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. Split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim’s bond market. There’s not much money in Meskalim itself, but it has a busy port and that means access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.
From there, it’s a simple matter of sprouting six more eyes, four more limbs, and now that you’ve become a human spider you’ll be able to spin a web of silver that stretches into every corner of the holy continent. The fools will walk right into the net of debt. The wiggling sticks them snug. You pick out the salvageable ones for your own use, and now you’ve got a little brood of spiders pouring over lists of sums credited and debts owed, and as long as you maintain a layer of abstraction between these creatures and your muscle, it’s all self-sustaining.
And that’s it. Now you have a comfortable life and idle hours to spend however you please.
“No debasement necessary,” Vigram added.
Mandri chowed down on the cold, crumbled chunks of what he supposed was black-sauced beef spleen. Most of Vigram’s breakfast foods were unfamiliar, as Vigram could afford to eat a different delicacy for every meal, every day of the week. He also had a chronic toothache, so he preferred foods that had to be scooped with sand clam shells and sauces that would stick to the roof of the mouth. This toothache also forced Vigram to talk out the side of his mouth in a wincing drawl.
“Mandri, you know all about art. And that’s why I respect you so much. But I know all about money, and at a certain point you have to join them up, because the world doesn’t work how it should. It works how it works. You have to make a living.”
Mandri wolfed down a peach-jellied egg, then meekly agreed. He would have told Vigram what he really thought, but he really, really, needed Vigram’s money.
Vigram clapped his meaty hands and a nameless slave came in and took their plates. Then the two of them headed out to Vigram’s vine-trellised, brown-brick patio, where Vigram set himself to work in setting up a canvas and an easel which he claimed to have built himself—slaves cut and planed the lumber, brewed the glue, hammered the metal fittings, but mighty Vigram did the rest.
Mandri said, “Are you sure you want to do this here?”
“Why not?” asked Vigram. “Is there something wrong?”
“No. There’s nothing wrong, exactly. It’s that this light is going to make things so much more difficult.”
The patio’s roof was not yet thick enough with vines, and that meant a richly dappled light would fall upon the sitter.
Vigram shook his head, which sent his great brown beard wiggling as if it were alive. “My dear Mandri,” he said, letting his drawl roll heavy. “The patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.”
“Well, you can worry about ‘magical vestures’ when you’re good enough to make a face look like a face.”
“No,” said Vigram. “I won’t have it any other way. A magical vesture for a magical subject.”
As if bidden from the heavens by Vigram’s words, his daughter, Lora, joined them on the patio. She was Vigram’s favorite subject, Mandri’s age, the only one of Vigram’s five children willing to sit for him. 
“Isn’t she a subject fit for holy oils?” Vigram asked.
“Undoubtedly,” said Mandri as his eyes flicked to Lora without intention, though Vigram interpreted it, as he always did, as the most rabid of intentions. The old man’s eyes squeezed out a suggestive smile, as if to give Mandri his patriarchal blessing.
Mandri pretended he didn’t notice.
Lora was good natured, comely, with clear brown skin and sun-kissed cheeks. She was also a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen lowing in the adjacent field. Many a young man would leap at the chance to be with such a fertility goddess, unfortunately Mandri didn’t want to have children.
“Help her up,” Vigram commanded. “I’ll ready the canvas and paint.”
Mandri did as he was told and helped Lora up onto a high-legged stool. Lora let her fingers linger on his arm. Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his muse.
Again, Mandri did as he was told and took up his post behind the old man.
Vigram snatched up a stick of soft charcoal and put down his first exploratory marks. This was always always the most difficult phase. Every work of art has to be built on a firm foundation. Get it wrong and everything that comes after will be wrong as well. Unfortunately for Vigram, he had that all-too-common beginner’s habit of refusing to use his god-damned brain. He started drawing wherever his hand randomly landed and what happened next was up to Solraheen. The end result was that Lora’s head was, somehow, too small. It was also too left-of-center. There’d be an awkward expanse behind her flower-studded curls.
“Hold on,” said Mandri. “You’re moving too fast. Don’t think of this as a portrait—not yet. All we have right now is an oval, a rectangular canvas, and where that oval sits on the canvas. All you’re doing is putting an oval on the canvas.”
“Right.”
“So think about where’s the best place to put that oval. Make use of the whole canvas.”
“Yes, yes you’re right.”
Vigram rubbed the marks away with his palm.
He stepped back.
He studied Lora.
He stepped again to the canvas.
Then he scratched a black oval right back where it had been.
“Is that better?” he asked with all the awareness of a potted plant.
“It needs to be a little bigger, I think.”
Vigram drew the oval again, but only slightly larger. Mandri encouraged the old man to continue, and from then on, almost every mark Vigram made was accompanied by a look back to Mandri for reassurance. 
“Don’t look at me, look at her.”
“I need to know if it is right or if it is wrong.”
“Assume that it’s always wrong, and then try to figure out why it’s wrong, and then fix it.”
There was a glimmer of understanding in Vigram’s eye, but as soon as it came it faded. He twirled his beard between his fat fingers, then asked, “If the mark I make is always wrong, then how could I ever move past it? I’ll be redrawing the same line over and over again.”
“You move on when you want to move on.”
“Then I want to move on. I’m here to paint, not draw.”
“Well, hold on. Finish…finish the basic shapes, at least.”
“Alright.”
Vigram ‘finished’ the ‘basic shapes’. He looked to Mandri for final approval.
“It’s your paint,” Mandri said with a shrug. “But you need to understand the importance of the drawing.”
“I do understand. You talk about it all the time.” Vigram tossed his charcoal over his shoulder and squealed with delight as he picked up his favorite brush.
Mandri watched on in confusion as Vigram threw down the first splotches of color in a flurry. The man was building an affront to the senses, and Mandri was getting paid to witness it. But he was more frightened of Lora. He couldn’t deny a glance or two in her direction, for she was the sitter. Whenever his eyes wandered over to her, her smile would perk up. 
“Mandri, stop flirting with my daughter.”
Vigram hid himself behind the canvas and gave Mandri a knowing nod and encouraging smile.
“I’m not flirting,” said Mandri. “I’m checking proportions.”
“And how are her proportions?” Vigram’s eyebrows jumped suggestively. Lora, for her part, squirmed in her seat, blushing in feigned embarrassment, loving the attention.
Mandri said, “Vigram, let’s focus on your painting.”
“What’s wrong with it?”
Mandri paused to give Vigram time to refocus his energy into the task at hand. Mandri knew what was wrong with the piece—he could write a treatise on it. He also knew that Vigram wouldn’t be able to handle an unvarnished critique. If the man got upset, then there’d be no more money, and Mandri really, really needed the money. Mandri was forced to compromise with himself and exercise restraint. He had to do what everyone else does—start off with a disarming compliment. Pick out a positive to open the student up to critique. The problem, at present, was that there was literally nothing good there on canvas.
“It’s good,” said Mandri.
He leaned back, sank into his hip and made every honest effort to study the mishmash that Vigram was putting down. Unfortunately, Vigram had that other beginner’s habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes—while that can be done, it's a very dangerous thing to do. Oils dry too slowly to mess around. 
“Vigram…”
“I know, I know.”
“I’m gonna say it anyway. You need to get the color correct on the palette before it touches the canvas. That’s what the palette is there for.” 
Vigram nodded, then began his work again in earnest, and the morning dragged on.
Eventually Vigram’s assault reached his daughter’s chin and he mixed a bluish shade of bronze. Unless there was some extraordinary circumstance of light and shadow—which there wasn’t—it was a color meant for the chin of a Jandri man who keeps a close shave. Vigram slapped it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes darted between his daughter and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips curled into a frown and he muttered, “That’s not quite right.” He gave Mandri a sheepish grin, then he stabbed his brush into a slug of white, and he rubbed it into that manly chin.
“That’s not quite right either.” 
This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.
“It’s not bad,” he said.
The charcoal guidelines looked like they were bleeding pus.
One of those leafy shadows had drifted over Lora’s left eye, and Vigram had an amusing go at it—it looked like a bandit’s eye-patch. 
“It’s good,” said Mandri. “No really, I mean it. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s… it’s on the path.”
“It does not do justice to such a fine daughter,” said Vigram.
Mandri tapped his bottom lip as Vigram stepped aside to let him fully into the work.
Mandri said, “Do you remember what I said last week?”
“You said that I need to study hands.”
“And have you done that?”
“Nope!”
Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. The fingers on his painting looked like a bundle of sticks.
“The only things that matter are the face and the hands.” Mandri was struggling to say useful things. “You could give Lora a hundred ribs and a single breast and people will forgive you for it, so long as you’ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, anatomically correct hands.”
“I’ll do better with the hands.”
Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his frustrated brow. This whole ordeal was a waste of time. If he didn’t need that money so damned bad, he’d have quit after the first session.
His little reverie was interrupted when Lora jumped from the stool, crying out, “Mandri’s ox is eating the apples!”
She pointed an accusing finger to the hill beyond the trellis. All eyes peered through the vines, where some twenty yards away stood Mandri’s one true possession—a skinny yellow ox named Gil. Gil was craning his head up high to reach a sweet red apple. His long pink tongue was stuck out and twirling, but all it was doing was batting the ripened fruit around in circles.
Vigram turned to Mandri, “Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?”
“Gil has a right to go where he wants,” Mandri said firmly.
“Well he’s not got a right to my apples! If that ox eats anything that’s not already on the ground, I’ll have my man butcher it up. Now get the beast tied up.”
“Where are you going?”
“I’m going to pick out a wine for brunch. Lora, my sweet, help the boy clean up. I’ll call you both when refreshment is ready.”
Old Vigram set his brush down and wiped his charcoal-stained fingers on an untouched corner of the canvas, and then he plodded off, leaving Mandri trapped on the patio with Lora.
Lora slid off her stool and sauntered over to Mandri, where her intrepid hand brushed the back of his arm. “I can help you,” she said. “I know how to catch animals.”
“Gil is not an animal,” said Mandri. “His Spark’s as bright as yours or mine.”
“He’s an ox, Mandri.”
“I’m serious. Watch…” Mandri turned to Gil, and out of her reach. “Gil!” he shouted. “Gil, C’mere!”
Gil’s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. His protuberant eyes stared back through the vines, a dumb, bovine ogle. Slobber dripped unheeded from his lower lip. 
“Gil!”
Gil blinked, then got distracted by the long grass brushing his belly, and he bit off a mouthful and began to chew.
“Gil! Hup!”
This startled Gil into motion, sending him trotting towards the patio. The flap of his heavy dewlap rolled his short-hair hide back and forth over his sagging, aged spine.
“Poor old creature,” Lora muttered.
“Ah, he’s fine,” Mandri said.
Gill clopped into the patio as if it were his living room.
Lora hid herself behind Mandri in mock fright. It was enough of an excuse for her to squeeze Mandri’s scrawny shoulders and press herself against him.
“You don’t need to be scared of Gil,” said Mandri. “He’s the nicest old ox you’ll ever meet. He likes a good scratch right between the eyes. See?” He stepped aside, out of Lora’s grasp, and stepped to greet Gil. 
Lora ventured hesitantly towards Gil, and Gil let her scratch him into a cooing moo.
She said, “He’s a sweet thing, isn’t he?”
“He is. But not as sweet as Vigram’s painting.”
Lora eyed her father’s painting and stifled a smile, but the depiction of her was so ridiculous that her smile grew bigger and bigger, until she finally broke out in laughter.
“He’s turned me into a demon,” she said. “It’s the hands, they look like claws.”
“I try to tell him…hands require practice.”
Lora sidled up to Mandri, grabbed his hand and said, with all the lust and must of a woman in heat, “Artists need strong and dexterous hands, don’t they?” 
“Uh…No…well, yes, but, uh… I don’t have any, uh, dexterity. I actually haven’t painted anything in years.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Lora. “We’ve seen you paint.”
“Demonstrations, sure, but those don’t really count.” 
“Then what have you been doing up on that little farm of yours?”
“Farming.”
Lora rolled her eyes. “Look at you,” she said. “You’ve never farmed a day in your life.”
“I’m not lying.”
Lora stepped closer and purred, “Then why don’t you paint anymore?”
“Uh…it would be too hard to explain.” Mandri tore himself away from Lora yet again and tried to busy himself with Vigram’s mess. There was enough untouched pigment left on the palette for four more portraits. He moved to scrape a slap of yellow back into its little clay jar.
“Try to explain it,” said Lora.
“Well, painting is, uh...”
Mandri tried to think of a palatable excuse, then he realized it was sitting right in his hands. “It’s too expensive. I mean, look at all this pigment. The canvas. At this point in my life it’d take me weeks to afford all this. Your father makes this in half a day.”
“You could make that much too if you came and worked for him.”
“I’m not good with money.”
“All you’d be doing is signing a scrap of paper every now and again.”
Lora picked up a dirty brush and twirled its horse-hair head through the muddy colors of the palette.
She said, “You know, he doesn’t actually care about learning to paint. The only reason he pays for these lessons is because you would starve if he didn’t. He likes you. I like you.” She batted her eyes and tried to catch him staring.
“Is that how he feels about it?” Mandri asked. “Well I don’t need charity.”
Lora sighed. “Mandri, I’ve seen your farm. My dad’s seen your farm. Everybody’s seen your farm. It’s not a farm.”
“It’s a farm to me. And it’s a farm to Gil. Isn’t that right, Gil?”
He turned to the animal, but Gil wasn’t even on the patio. He’d snuck his way back up the hill to lick at that damned apple.
Lora rolled the handle of the paintbrush in between her fingers. She said, “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
“What?”
“They say that you’re a eunuch.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
“An old woman came looking for you. She said you were a eunuch, too.”
“A woman came here just to tell you I’m a eunuch?”
“She called you a gaburshegee. She said that means eunuch, and she was looking for you.”
“When?”
“Yesterday.”
“Well she couldn’t have been looking for me, because I’m not a eunuch.”
“Prove it.”
Mandri’s jaw dropped. 
“What?”
Lora crossed her arms and gave Mandri a sly, expectant look. “I’m a woman, Mandri. What’s your problem?”
“I’m not going to pull my uglies out just to prove they’re there.”
Mandri believed this would be enough to put her off, but Lora was a girl trained in the art of bashful men. She saw right through him and made her move, grabbed his arm and pulled him close. She caught his eyes and forced him to confront her lilac’d scent, her pounding heat, her smooth skin, her honeyed, aching lips.
“Lora…” 
Mandri knew he had to be very careful here.
“You’re a beautiful girl, but—”
“But what? You go in for men?”
“No!—no.”
“I could be good for you,” she said.
“And what do you get out of it?”
She squeezed herself against him and her warmth was overwhelming.
“You could be good for me,” she said. 
“You would not say that if you really knew me.”
“What’s there to know? You’re just a boy.”
Mandri’s eyes widened at the sight of her inviting smile, and the soft shadows of the vines overhead just so happened to frame her sparkling brown eyes with the most magnificent golden light. A magical vesture indeed. 
He nearly broke. He probably would have too if Gil hadn’t reached his apple and let out a triumphant bellow. 
“MMMMRRRRUUUUUooooooooooOOOOOOOoooo!”
Gil’s roar was so loud and sickly that it startled Mandri and Lora out of their awkward embrace.
Mandri backed up against the vines.
“Lora, this is not what I’m here for.”
“It’s what I’m here for,” said Lora.
Mandri looked for a means of escape and his eyes stumbled over one of the house’s misty window panes, behind which Vigram’s bearded face was smiling so wide it seemed he was about to stamp a return on interest.
“Okay. I’m leaving.”
Mandri practically leaped off the patio.
Lora shouted after him, “What is wrong with you?”
Mandri did not answer. There was no point in answering. This was not what he was here for. He ran, then jogged, then walked, then stopped when he realized that he was forgetting something.
“Gil!”
But Gil was already trotting down the gentle hill to follow. Mandri waited up, and together they headed for the estate’s swing gate.
Vigram was on their heels, marching fast with his robe hiked up and his long beard tucked under his arm.
“What happened!?” he shouted.
“Nothing,” said Mandri. “I’m leaving.”
“You’re leaving?”
“Look, Vigram, I don’t want to be a bother, but could I get the money?”
Vigram frowned. He reached into his robe and pulled out a small brown sack of coin. He held it in the air as if to lure Mandri back towards the house.
He said, “Lora thinks you’re using this money to buy burgeons from Geem.”
“Burgeons?” asked Mandri.
“You deny it?”
“What would Lora know?”
“Do you deny it?”
“Of course I deny it.”
Vigram eyed Mandri with suspicion, then he shook the bag of coin and said, “I want you to promise me that you’re not going to use this money to buy burgeons.”
“I promise.”
Vigram looked down his nose at Mandri and scratched his beard. He said, “I’m going to give you this money because I owe it. If I find out you’re using this for burgeons, then our arrangement here is finished. You won’t be coming back. And for Sol’s sake, buy some apples for this creature of yours.”
“I will.”
Vigram put the bag in Mandri’s palm, and Mandri tucked it into his robe.
“You’ve got the gift of the brush, Mandri. Solraheen’s given you a gift. It’s a sacred gift.”
“I know. I’ll see you later.”
Mandri and Gil walked out the gate. 
“I’m serious!” Vigram called out. “You’ve been given a gift!”
Mandri waved back.
It wasn’t a gift, not a special one, at least. He could paint a portrait in twenty-four strokes, but few would be impressed if they watched him do it. He would spend hours and hours making those single strokes. He’d put one down, and if it wasn’t exactly right, he’d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and he’d repeat this for as long as it took. Days. A week. Longer. Had to wait for the paint to dry. People only ever saw the finished product, those twenty-four strokes, and upon seeing it they assumed that Mandri’s brush went slip-slap-boom and there’s a true likeness. That story couldn’t be further from the truth. Mandri’s real talent was his tolerance of tedium, and that’s a talent a person can lose—Mandri was living proof. 
When he and Gil got to the top of the big hill that overlooked Vigram’s estate, he took one last look back. Vigram was still standing in his drive. The old man waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, “No burgeons!”
“Yeah, yeah,” Mandri muttered under his breath.
“They’ll douse your Spark!”
Mandri waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem’s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. They were Down-Valley burgeons, decent stuff but the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle so they’d split too quickly and the insides would dry out before Mandri could get to them. But that was all Geem had so he bought them. 
Mandri and Gil continued along the road, stomping their way through the muddy wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, humming and mooing nursery rhymes until they made it back Mandri’s farm. There he could finally relax and lose all sense of himself in the deep and blessed bliss brought on by beer spiked through with burgeons.

            <Text>They slept, each noon, for five hands. They propped up woolen blankets on bushes for shade, and Mandri was allowed to share one of these with Purl. He could hear Purl breathing, feel her warmth, and despite that, there was no pounding lust in his ears. Unusual for Mandri. He told Obo about it, because by now they were sharing most thoughts with each other, and Obo said the Hrkan hardtack Mandri was eating was mixed with succor of salt. Succor of salt is an anaphrodisiac. It curbs the libido. The Lords don’t want their troops rubbing uglies when they’ve got more important things to do..
Mandri resolved to eat no more of the hardtack, but changed his mind when Obo forced him to consider the alternative—he’d be out here in the Sand, lust pounding away, uglies alert, with no real way to find release.</Text>

            <Title>Basic Story Structure</Title>
            <Text>Defining Characteristic
Describe your protagonist using a word or short phrase that can go before their name.

Hopes and Dreams
Before the story begins, what does your character want? What are their goals or dreams? Finish the sentence in the box below.
Ex. to fit in at his new boarding school, to escape their evil step-father's grasp, a new book to read

Inciting Incident
What is the event that upsets your protagonist's world and sets the story in motion?
Ex. a fellow student dies, The Prince invites them to a ball, she discovers a magical spell book

Incited Action
What is the action does your protagonist take as a result of the inciting incident?
Ex. discovers they were murdered, accepts the invitation, decides to protect it at all costs

Updated Purpose
What is your protagonist's new purpose? And what might be the consequences of not reaching it?
Ex. must investigate the crimes before the murderer strikes again, hatches a plan to make the prince fall in love with them as an escape from her life with their evil step-father, is the only force keeping the book from falling into the hands of an organization bent on ridding the world of magic

The New Normal
Your protagonist is doing A Lot in the first half of the book, but in general terms describe the collection of actions that your protagonist is taking, now that events have been incited, and calls to action have been answered.
Ex. investigates the strange circumstances surrounding the murder; gets ready to attend the ball; searches for the High Librarian, in whose hands the book will be truly safe

New Discoveries
As your protagonist dives into the new world of the story, what are they discovering about it and/or themselves? The discovery should complicate their situation.
Ex. another student may be responsible for the crime; they may not need the prince to escape their step-father after all; the conspiracy to rid the world of magic goes deeper than they could ever have imagined.

Initial Challenges
What are some of the initial challenges your protagonist faces?
Ex. a red herring leads him in the wrong direction and leads him to accuse the wrong person in front of the entire school; the conspirators destroy the library and force her to flee.

The Great Challenge
What is your protagonist's greatest challenge? The problem that seems unsolvable? This should be a plot point introduced mid-way through the book.
Ex. Jeff discovers he's the murderer's new target; their step-father locks them in a tower when they try to leave for the ball; it turns out the High Librarian is working for the evil organization.

Challenge Outcomes
Give two conflicting outcomes to the challenge. Best result vs. Worst result. The thing they think they want vs. the thing they actually need. This will act as a hook to make your reader want to learn what happens to your protagonist.
Ex. solve the murder/become the murderer's next victim; find a way to The Prince/figure out a way to save themselves; learn enough magic to save the book/else be responsible for a world without magic.

            <Title>Goree Pass</Title>
            <Text>The story of the curse upon the Goree Pass was one of Mandri’s favorite stories. An ancient tribe called the Solgruin asked Solraheen to split the Goree mountain so that the overland journey east would be made easier. Solraheen, walked to the mountains and climbed the tallest peak where he stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
He said to the petitioners, “Look upon this scar which mars My creation and hate your selfish ways. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed and so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
For Mandri, this story justified the act of ripping up a painting to spite a client, just as Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin.
He’d only ever done it once, but what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a week and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the barbarian King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would go to her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a proto-Hrkan Lord on the richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, “That looks just like your Pookum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Pookum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with resentment. As his fingers tore the canvas an unfamiliar euphoria coursed through his veins. He tore the painting completely in half, right there in front of that cursed woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have killed that woman, just as Solraheen killed all those who journeyed the Goree Pass. Well, He didn’t kill them, He cursed them. Curses, it turns out, does little to dissuade people. After all, here they were, the Ayramun, Mandrameen himself, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the pass.
According to Moto, the Greskalun made their home inside the pass itself.
Either there was no curse and the story was only a story, or maybe the Solitants were right about not taking the surface meaning too seriously. Or, and this is what Moto believed, the curse was only meant for the Solgruin. Everyone else could do what they want.
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, further out was the black sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib from spreading out of control. 
The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen’s spite became, for the ground under Mandri’s feet grew uneven, and rocks popped up out of the sand like roots to trip him. The Goree’s walls grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground. These cracks had long been rubbed smooth, an eon of blasting sand had rounded their edges, pillowed the seams, giving them the appearance of bloated infection. Mandri’s bright mood dimmed at the sight of them—it was quite apparent that the place was truly cursed. 
Soon the Goree Pass was sighted in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree’s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Ayram informed the rest that this splinter was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the breadth of the pass’s mouth, protecting against ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now, and had done so for centuries.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through a debris field from a mountain cleft exploding.
The scattered boulders were indeed a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been indescribable. It would have been unbelievable if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Solraheen standing up there on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the dusty wind, and, well, a god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe to set the mountains quaking and bursting, sending stones the size of houses miles into the air. A long sliver of the mountain reduced to rubble and vomited out onto the desert plain in the blink of an eye.
Most of the Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram walked with a bowed head, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
Purl was ashen-faced and whispering to herself.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, like his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—angry and quiet.
Meanwhile Seb was chewing his borcandi spines so hard that his jaw was going stiff and he had to sort of rub them between his teeth instead of chew. And the man wasn’t paying attention to where he was spitting his juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, he hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted himself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Don’t you disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me disrespect you?”
“You threaten a man with his kneecaps, that’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“It was an accident!”
“And I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He doubled back to make sure he was listened to.
Both men’s backs went stiff.
Ayram said sternly, “Nobody talks from here on out. Except Elrahet.”
Mandri asked, “So the Hrks are coming today?”
“I said nobody talks.”
Ayram’s deep voice rumbled Mandri to his core, but Obo was not so affected. He added, from behind Mandri’s ear, “Oh, the Hrks will be on us today, I’m sure.”
“You can sense the Hrks?” Ayram asked, startled. “They’re here?”
“I can, but the Hrks aren’t who you should be worried about. It’s the Greskalun. Something’s happened to them.”
“The creature seeks to stall us,” Elrahet grumbled.
Ayram’s grave visage lingered on Obo a moment, then he muttered a curse under his breath and he set off again towards the pass, this time more cautiously, peeking out from behind boulders, and climbing upon them to look for the Hrks behind them. 
By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. He could not shake this foreboding feeling that this once living mountain was now dead and rotted through. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock because they were as friable as the hardtack Mandri was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased—when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against a boulder, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the stone were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread. And then there was the black tower itself, poking out like a splinter stuck in a wound.
An uneasiness had settled in amongst them ever since Obo’s grim pronouncement. Mandri wasn’t worried as much about the Greskalun, for him, his fear stemmed from the tower. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower.
And It was black. No bright Spark ever builds in black.
And the central task of a monument to some grave sin is to look like it doesn’t belong. The tall spike of a tower did this quite comfortably.
Mandri thought he’d die on the approach, for the brittle rock slopes threatened to come galloping down upon him every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks. Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by their invisible Hrkan pursuit. He pioneered a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo without seeing him, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered for making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof that Obo was wrong about ‘something happening’ to the Greskalun. 
Then the Goree pass opened up before them.
The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle, and to either side, black stone walls sprawled across the red-stone gap. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s mouth, though the gate in the tower’s base was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that Obo was right—something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off towards the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb said, “Maybe they all retreated into their temple.” Seb was so stressed out that he was chewing two spines at once and his words were garbled by a slosh of spit.
“Retreated from what?” Moteah asked.
“I don’t know,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Purl.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “That could be it! It’s happened before, right? That’s what they do whene the pox gets on them, they run back into their temple and stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.” 
“I don’t think we should go in,” Purl said. She then stated the obvious, “It’s cursed.”
Mandri said, “You guys know the story about how the Goree Pass was created, right?”
“Yes, we know,” Moteah groaned.
“I wasn’t sure. It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since forever.”
“It’s not cursed,” said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows.
As if to prove him wrong, a black vulture, which had been hiding in the shadow of the tower’s pointed roof, squawked and took flight. It spread its long wings and soared, caught a thermal, and rode it high up into the air, where it wheeled around in circles.
“It’s only a bird,” Ayram muttered.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and wheeled up into the air. They joined their brother’s holding pattern, and their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient curse.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Seb, “Then the Hrkan Lords woulda choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The mood was affecting even Ayram. The strongest men are perhaps the most frightened by magic. A curse from a god was not something he could kill with his spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion of his control.
The giant marched over to Mandri, and Mandri flinched, fearing he’d done or said something wrong. 
“Take off your pack,” Ayram grumbled. Mandri did as he was told and swung Obo’s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it, set it down, and he squatted next to it so he could get a good clear look at Obo’s face. He said, “Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?” There was no room in his tone for games.
“No,” said Obo.
Ayram growled a disbelieving grunt. 
Obo said, “You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. I know you outland pokes abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when—”
“The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.”
“If you are asking me if there’s a small army of Hrkan Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. But I do think your instincts are correct—what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter.”
Seb spat in Obo’s general direction. The loogie just missed Obo’s litter and splatted harmlessly in the dirt. “Them Greskalun could still be those mountains. Pox, or drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” said Moteah.
“Or maybe not,” Obo said, suggesting he knew better. Instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter, his elbows stretching his swaddling fabric as he twisted around. Mandri couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight of it—he looked like a toddler trying to roll over, trying to get comfortable for a nap. With effort, Obo poked the stub of his arm up and out of the neck of his tightly wrapped robe, and he used it to widen the opening so that he could stick his whole handless arm through. Once done, he reached out behind him and nudged something into view. It was a bone.
“Where did you get that?” Moteah asked.
“It was sitting here,” said Obo. “Not the first one I’ve seen. Honestly, I’m surprised you all missed it.”
Obo pushed the bone out before him, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.
“This,” said Obo, “Is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.”
Seb stomped over and nudged it with his toe. “You find one bone and you think them dead? One bone on the ground? A bone on the ground ain’t unusual. Where else are you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Let the Mazid speak,” said Ayram.
Obo nudged the bone so that it flipped over. “This is an unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
He rubbed his pale, nubby wrist along the length of the fracture. It wasn’t a clean fracture, it was a splintered fracture which stretched almost along the whole length of it, leaving the upturned half to look like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unimpressed.
“Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that’s how bones naturally break. A break like this—it’s not likely to happen accidentally.”
Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing paws the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “If your point is that this person was killed, that’s not unusual.”
“I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the pass,” Mandri said.
“We’re not in the pass,” Ayram said.
Obo shrugged and said, “Whoever it was, however they died, that’s not what is significant. This was no simple killing. A blow to the leg would not crack the bone like that. It could happen, but the chances of that occurring are exceedingly slim.”
“Get on with it,” Ayram grumbled.
“I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri ruin. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating other people. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone up so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with images of a cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his teeth. Ayram held the bone out away from him as if it were diseased and the thirst for flesh could rub off on him like a plague.
Elrahet waddled over and yanked the bone from the giant’s grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the open socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone onto the sand, right in front of Obo.
“Look!” shouted Purl. She was pointing towards the tower. Moto was sprinting out of the tower’s gate back towards them, running at full speed, frenetic, as if he were being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust in the wide mouth of the empty pass. When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!” He looked over his shoulder and grimaced.
“Pick up the Mazid,” Ayram said to Mandri, and with that it was decided—Ayram would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower and its gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled, and bowing every so slightly out. Bricks bulged, some were twisted, some seem to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The gate underneath it was ten-men wide, and its arch was fanged by metal teeth which hung ominously above Ayram’s head. The tunnel itself was as large as the hall of the Hrkan prince, big enough to turn the sound of Ayram’s iron spear thumping against the hard dirt ground into an echo. Aside from this metronomic beat, they passed through this dark in silence, casting wary glances at each large door frames that pocketed either side of the gate’s long tunnel.
Moto stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and a shadow of shadows passed over his dark face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it.
All around, stuck out of the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly and twice taller than Ayram. Wrapped around them were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
It was a desecration.
Such was the defilement that curses leapt into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. The horror robbed him of his sense of the future, and it sent his stomach into a terrible, growling fit.
The nearest wretch was some ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant pilgrim. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, lolling in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of god.
They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor Sparks littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.
Obo, with the use of his newly freed arm, hauled himself up onto Mandri’s shoulder to see for himself.
Mandri muttered, “I guess we know what happened to the Greskalun.”
Obo agreed. “They must have gone insane,” he said. “I did not know one could hate a pilgrim this deeply.”
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. 
Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. 
Purl sank to her knees, half in prayer, half in buckling despair. 
Seb, a man who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. 
The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil presence of the scene for she had not made it through the tunnel. She was sitting inside its shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye back at his mournful band.
He said, “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, but I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into his skin. Seb said, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? Besides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em ‘cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’.”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as he gestured at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.
“Moteah’s right,” she said, and her gravelly voice stunned them all back into silence. “Greskal would never do a thing like this.”
Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the darkness of the tunnel after her. Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up, leaning on her walking stick. If before her verve was waning, it was now well and truly gone. She walked towards the courtyard with a hobbling hitch that was not there before.
“They must have sensed the panic,” she said.
It seemed all her joints were aching as she lurched onwards. It was as if every long year of her life was suddenly set upon her.
“Not just Greskal’s panic, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets their stomachs growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light of the courtyard and surveyed the carnage with a hateful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? You have sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long that you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I can tell when someone has pissed themselves, if that’s what you’re asking?”
“PANIC!” Elrahet roared. “Panic sets their stomachs growling. Panic wakes them up.”
“Wakes who up?” Seb asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled to reveal a snaggletoothed grin.
“Demons,” she said.
The word zipped past Mandri’s ear like an arrow aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“This was demons that did this,” Elrahet declared.
“You’re talking about, demon demons?” Mandri asked.
“Is there any other kind?”
Ayram, still composed, said, “We’ll do what we can for them, then we leave.”
Seb raised voice and declared, “There ain’t nothin’ we can do for ‘em!”
“He’s right,” said Elrahet. “First time in his dumb life, but he’s right. There’s nothing we can do for these people.”
“Dead is dead,” Seb said.
“Oh, they aren’t dead,” said Elrahet with a sneer.
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim, and what he saw was death. Death was becoming a familiar sight to him, and he’d seen enough to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive. 
Purl said, “We should do what we can for them.”
“We could kill them,” said Moto. “That would put an end to this.”
Elrahet sighed and said, “Their very Sparks are bound to the poles. Death, for them, is impossible.” She stamped her impatience into the ground with her cane and repeated, “We must leave at once.”
With that she turned and began to hobble back into the tunnel.
Moto was the first to follow. Then Ayram and Purl. Mandri joined them in the shadow of the tower and was glad to be gone from that courtyard.
“Hold on,” Seb said. “We’re goin’ back!? What about the Greskalun?” He pointed with a jabbing, open hand towards the Goree pass, as if the Greskalun were right there and Elrahet only had to squint a little to see them.
Moteah brushed past him and said, “There are no Greskalun.”
Seb stood his ground. “You can’t know that ‘til we go and have a look! We at least got to try.”
“There’s demons!” said Moto.
“Can’t be worse than Hrks.”
As soon as the words had left his mouth, there came from the distant west a sharp and roaring bleat—the Hrkan horn of war.
BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooo
The call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and there in the far distance was a horse and rider, galloping around from the right, around the sprawling tumble of the Pass’s shattered stones.
The horse, white as bone, came stumbling to a stop and reared up almost to the point of no control. The rider, little more than a speck so far away, was a man as dark as Moto and clad in the familiar blue robe of a Hrkan scribe. He shouted a command to his beast to settle it down, and all the while his face was trained on the tunnel where Mandri and the Ayramun stood.
Seb was already fleeing. He was halfway up into the pass proper when he stopped and waved for everyone to follow.
“Damnit, come on!” he urged.
No one moved save for Ayram, who unshouldered his great pack and tossed it to the floor.
Though the scribe was far away, all could see that in his hand was a sword, for he held it high, and the silver blade and golden guard caught the glare of the pre-noon sun. He barked some indiscernible word, and then, with a sweeping flourish, threw his sword onto the sand.
Moto saw the scribe’s sign and gaped in disbelief. “He wants to bargain?”
The Hrkan horn sounded out again.
BWEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooooooo
From around the Pass’s northern shelf came a column of white robed soldiers. At their head was a small child robed in black—the Mazidariga. They spread out into a line just behind the scribe.
Purl asked everyone, “What do we do?”
Obo perked up and said, “That Riga out there could have whistled out my will-less Spark by now, but it hasn’t. Those soldiers could be charging towards this tower, but they aren’t. There’s not much to read into this—these people actually mean to bargain.”
Moto asked, “Why?”
“The same reason anyone bargains—they think they have something to lose.”
Moteah said, “Maybe they think the Greskalun are here and on our side.”
“Your guess is as good as mine,” said Obo.
“Stay here, and stay hidden,” said Ayram. “I’m going to see what they want.”
He began to march through the tunnel and out of the gate, spear gripped tightly in hand. The Hrkan scribe, upon seeing Ayram marching out into the Sand, set his horse to trotting towards the tower.
Ayram paused a few yards outside the tower’s gate, forcing the scribe to cross the greater distance.
When the horse and rider finally neared the giant, Ayram laid down his spear. And though the scribe was high in his a saddle, they met almost eye to eye.
“Are you Greskal?” The rider asked, impressed at Ayram’s size.
“I am not.”
The answer took the scribe by surprise.
“Are you the master of this tower?”
Ayram glanced behind him and said, “This tower has no master. As you can see, it is empty, save for me and mine.”
The scribe’s horse was becoming fidgety. No doubt it had caught wind of the terror that lay in the courtyard. The scribe mistook it for fright at Ayram’s height.
The stern man said, “We know that the Mazidobo resides in this tower.”
“So it does,” said Ayram. 
“Then bring it forth. I wish to speak with it.”
“You can speak with me,” said Ayram gruffly. “I will pass your message along.”
The scribe frowned. “This is not the time for games,” he warned. “We found the body of the Mazidariga of Shuls out in the desert.”
“Is that so?”
“Tell me, has the Mazidobo lost its flame? We saw no scorch marks.”
“You are welcome to test that interpretation, should you wish.”
The scribe sneered and said, “We know the Mazidobo has acquired some means of reversing the Mazidariga’s charm. We know that it escaped the leash of his Minder. We wish to come to terms with it, so as to avoid any further loss of life.”
The scribe’s horse was growing more perturbed by the moment. Its eyes were wide and its nostrils flared and it kept trying to resettle its rider, as if preparing to bolt.
“Tell the Mazidobo, that as we speak, a battalion of Hrkan Skulsi marches into the eastern mouth of the Goree Pass. At their head is the Mazidurn. Behind me, as you can see, is a column of swords, and coming up from the south, from the Solgi, is the Mazidban, who shall be with us shortly. As such, you are all surrounded, and should it come to it, you will be overwhelmed. There is no way out excepting the event in which you and yours peaceably disarm yourselves, and the Mazidobo offers itself up into my charge. In exchange, all lives will all be spared, and the Mazidobo shall be allowed to retire from service after submitting to examination. We do not need violence here, nor do we want it. More than anything, we want the Mazidobo alive, for we wish to learn from its malfunction.”
“I don’t much like those terms,” Ayram said.
The scribe frowned and his horse bucked slightly, sharing its rider’s frustration.
“This is not a matter for you to decide,” the scribe said. “Bring my terms to the Mazidobo, or bring the Mazidobo and I’ll tell it myself.”
Ayram stroked his beard. He looked up at the sky, arced his shoulders, and he drew in a breath that could fill an ox’s stomach, enough air to think for a good long while. In the intervening silence, the scribe’s horse began to clip-clop its agitation, bouncing the scribe uncomfortably in his saddle.
“Settled down you crooked beast!”
He gave his horse a foul kick in the ribs.
Ayram finally said, “The Mazid and its Minder will only treat with their own kind.”
“The Mazidobo’s Minder is dead. His body was found two weeks ago in the Junei hills.”
“The Mazid has a new Minder. An old witch.”
The scribe’s brow jumped in surprise, and that quickly turned into elation. He mused, “That’s good. An unleashed Mazid would be no good for any of us. But if it will only speak to a Mazid, then we will have to wait, for the Mazidban will not be here for at least another hand.”
Ayram said, “The Mazidobo will treat with the Mazidariga.” He nodded towards the Hrkan line behind the scribe.
The scribe bit his lip in frustration. He looked up, took in the tower, then spied the long distance behind him.
“Fine,” he said. “But I won’t do this business in the shadow of this accursed place. We’ll meet where the tower’s shadow meets the light of Solraheen.”
With the sun approaching its noontime zenith, the tower’s shadow extended out into the desert a mere forty yards or so.
“Fair enough,” said Ayram.
Before the scribe and his horse ran off, he said,  “There’s no sense in playing me, poke. There’s nowhere to run if you resort to trickery.”
Ayram picked up his spear. The scribe sneered, then barked at his horse and yanked on the reins as he jabbed its flanks with his heels. Off they went galloping, back towards the Hrkan line.  
Ayram spun around, and nested inside his beard was the biggest of all possible smiles, considering the size of his head.
“Solraheen shines on us!” he declared as he stepped back into the tower’s tunnel. Moto was the first to greet him by saying, “This will be easier than I ever dreamed.”
Ayram nodded and said, “That scribe won’t know what hit him. Can you believe it!? Hrks think they’re gods when they’re stuck up on a horse. Who says the Goree is cursed?”
He marched over to his giant pack, untied the bindings that kept it shut, then lifted it up and dumped its contents on the floor.
“Split this up between you,” he said. “And make sure that everyone is ready to run.”
“Run where?” Seb asked.
Ayram said, “Once I strike that scribe down, we need to run. I’m not going to stop to help any of you get yourselves together, so if you’re not ready, if you fall behind, you’re forgotten.”
Ayram then stepped over to Mandri. He said, “Turn around,” and Mandri turned, and then Ayram pulled Obo out of the litter by his skull again, as if handling a melon.
Obo dangled in Ayram’s grip, looking like a pale worm. He said to Ayram, “You know, I could ruin this for you.”
Ayram’s mood soured at the suggestion.
“I’m not going to ruin it,” Obo said. “I just wanted you all to know that I could have.”
Ayram grunted and tossed Obo onto his emptied pack. Obo’s pale, bald head and bony arm were almost glowing in the tunnel dark, but most of all, his saucer eyes were bright and shining. They scanned the world for something, probably they were looking for something he could use to rescue himself. Mandri knew no rescue was coming and that, for Obo, this might be the end. Then those eyes settled on Mandri, and Mandri felt his stomach knot.
There was nothing he could do for Obo—and yet…and yet…odd that he should feel this way for so strange a face. Some mothers love children with faces much worse off than Obo’s, not that Mandri was feeling something so pure. It was just the sense of pity—Obo was going to be snuffed out for no other reason than he was what he was, and what a shame. Born almost yesterday, enslaved and tortured all his short life, quartered by desert bandits, and he was still holding out hope, still looking at Mandri like Mandri was important. 
Mandri had to look away. But he could not quell the budding sense that something was being uncovered here, and that was horrible, because as any self-watcher knows, finding things out about oneself is the worst kind of finding. And Obo was right there, and this was a permanent goodbye, Mandri knew it. Then that pang of pity came back fierce and welled up in his throat.
He could not speak for fear of sobbing.
He swallowed it down.
He glanced at Obo and the sob of pity rose again.
Then a small miracle occurred.
Seb, in an attempt to reorganize his pack’s interior to make room for a bundle of dried beef, pulled out a woolen blanket, and in so doing, unwittingly pulled out his pouch of burgeons as well. The pouch hit the ground and out popped three beautiful God’s Eye burgeons. Two of them spiraled harmlessly in little circles, but one burgeon hit the ground rolling as if flicked towards Mandri’s toes by Solraheen Himself.
Mandri covered it up with his foot. When Seb finally noticed that his burgeons had spilled, he snatched them up, quick as a fox, none the wiser that he’d missed one.
The feeling of that burgeon under Mandri’s heel was brighter than any morning. Mandri didn’t even hear Obo’s final parting.
“Never let it be said that I didn’t do anything for you people.”
Moto yanked the L-frame litter right off Mandri’s back, because Moto had made a makeshift bag out of a blanket, and he’d filled that bag with the stuff that had tumbled out of Ayram’s pack—liquid skins, knotted ropes and strings, and odd-shaped dried mutton lumps wrapped in linen cloth.
Where had any of that meat been during the long journey through the Tib?
No matter.
There was God’s Eye under his foot.
But even this thought was not enough to last, for when Moto handed the litter back to Mandri, it was twice the weight that Obo ever was.</Text>

            <Title>Dying Pilgrim</Title>
            <Text>Ayram led them to a southeast leading Charnel road called the Hatthir road. There were plenty of pilgrim skeletons lying about the Hatthir road. One of them, it turned out, was still alive. Ayram noticed the man first. He picked up the poor pilgrim and set him the shade of a makeshift tent. The dying pilgrim stared out at all the Ayramun with winkless eyes. His skin was like paper, and his ribs were countable through the window in his yellow haircloth habit.
This pilgrim thought Ayram was Solraheen enfleshed. Ayram did not disabuse him of this notion. He sponged water onto the man’s lips, and the man wheezed out a few final words which no one heard.
Mandri gave the pilgrim a rock he’d found the day before. It was a hollow tube of rock scrubbed smooth by sand. Obo had said it wasn’t a rock, but part of a hardened reed. Whatever it was, it put a passing joy into the pilgrim’s eyes, and Mandri was glad to see it. Then they all moved on to let him die.</Text>

            <Title>Ambush</Title>
            <Text>Seb hated the waiting that came before an ambush, for the future was coming and with it came death or glory. It was hard not to get excited and make expectations. She dreamed of death and glory. She’d been anticipating this particular chance for weeks. Her expectations were built up so high that they’d gone past giddy excitement and had hardened into a sense of impending doom, such that she felt certain she was going to die. Glory was less certain. She reminded herself that she’d felt this way before in the last ten big ambushes, and she’d always come out alive.
But there were Ayramun who’d been through it twenty times and died on the twenty first.
It was horrible, this feeling, and being forced to sit with it made it worse to be the ambusher than the ambushee. Travelers in the Sand might be expecting to encounter some gang of hard-up outland pokes, but they expected to live through it or they never would have set out in the first place. Death comes as a surprise for them, and their dread is short lived. It wouldn’t be close to what Seb went through. Those people were lucky they died so quickly.
Then again, maybe they weren’t lucky, because it might be true that the only thing that matters in life is what the mind is like at the exact moment of death, because when the Spark drops out of time, who knows, those last thoughts might be crystallized for all eternity. If one’s last moment is agony then it’s agony forever. Get lucky and it's a deep sleep. Get unlucky, get ambushed in the desert and a sharpened point of iron finds the forehead and scratches the brain, that look of shock and surprise can get fixed on the skull. Sometimes it sets hard as stone. There’s not much comfort in the fact that these terrified faces eventually get wiped away when some gummy mouthed, flat faced lizard waddles in and chews it up, because by that point the Spark is already good and gone.
And if all that were true, it could happen to Seb.
She could get unlucky.
Of course it wasn’t luck, it was all part of a divine plan, but ‘luck’ and ‘bad luck’ were just words describing the same thing. Ultimately it didn’t matter what she called it, she worried about it all the same.
This particular ambush was feeling more risky than most. The plan to take out the Mazid and its Minder had to play out exactly as expected, or else all the Ayramun would be killed. If a Mazid were free to run amok, they would be killed. Without a doubt, killed. A Mazid could wipe out an entire army by itself. And even if they did take the Mazid down cleanly, there’d be fifty to eighty men of unknown prowess that needed killing. If they were Hrkan Skulsi, that would be too much. 
Fifty-to-eighty.
Maybe ninety.
There were only forty three Ayramun with fifteen arrows each. Seb’s rule of thumb was that arrows go roughly three-to-one, misses to hits—depending, of course, on the skill of the archer. She didn’t have an aptitude for numbers, but it seemed like there weren’t enough arrows. It would be close, and close was dangerous. And their arrows were a kind of shit—the tips were lizard’s teeth reinforcing a hardwood point. The shafts were a strong, close-grain wood, but that made them too stiff. Bandits don’t live long in the desert if they’re always scraping by, when they’re scraping by with lizard’s teeth they tend to die quite quickly. 
She knew she wasn’t the only one worried about it all because the rest of the Ayramun were as quiet as declawed cats. Even the three lizard brothers who never stopped joking around, they were quiet. Ambushes usually weren’t an exception for them. A gold caravan could be passing right by and they’d find fun in risking discovery by tumbling a stone down a rocky slope, or blundering a fart and then claiming later that they couldn’t help it. Even these idiots were keeping low and moving slowly, naught but skinny shadows being whipped to and fro by Moto’s whistled calls though the Junei hills. 
There was no forgiving horsing around because the rumor was that a Mazid’s eyes were as good as Moto’s rock crystal lenses, and a Mazid’s ears were as good as a spade-eared bat. That caravan was close enough now that if a Mazid truly was in their midst then its superfine senses would uncover their trap if they weren’t careful. Despite this, when their troupe came to halt in a narrow valley, Seb dared to climb up the slope and sneak a peek over the crest of the hill. She could just pick out the brownish speck of that caravan against the white of the Junei plain.
She was trying to gauge the manpower when Moto hissed a whisper at her.
“Seb! Get down!”
Seb spun around and there was Moto, staring daggers into her. Seb seethed like a lizard caught unawares, then reluctantly ducked back down into the shadow of the valley slope. Moto was the only one allowed to peek out over the hills and down into the spreading plain. He was the only one allowed because he’d said he was the only one allowed. Ayram had given him that authority and Seb couldn’t argue with it. If Ayram were in charge she could maybe wheedle the privilege out of him, but there was no sense in pleading a case to Moto, so Seb slid back down the valley to take up the hiding place that she’d scouted earlier in the day
It was a long, narrow valley, steep-sided, and it bowed to the left around a lumpy hill, which was good because the hill would keep their hiding places out of sight until the last moment. Still, Seb would have preferred springing the ambush in the Junei Pass proper like they usually did. Moto insisted on doing it out in the hills on account of, ‘everyone expects to be ambushed inside the pass’. Moto insisted that the best thing to do was to mirror the caravan as they made their way across the plain, then meet them in the hills and attack while their eyes were set on the gap in the mountains.
Seb appreciated the logic of it—work against expectations, but at a certain point the best land for an ambush was the best land for an ambush, didn’t matter if the unfortunate knew it was coming. People worried about ambushes in bottlenecks because bottlenecks were the best place to ambush. A valley like this was no true bottleneck. Compared to the vast expanse of the Junei plain, sure, it would do, but the slopes were nowhere near the height or steepness of a mountain shelf. The Hrks could scramble up and over them and maybe escape. It’d be like kicking off the top of an ant hill and all of a sudden it’s a free-for-all in all directions. They’d leave their wagons, but wagons weren’t what the Ayramun were after. And if those boys were Hrkan Skulsi, then the last thing Seb wanted to do was share a slope with them.
All this was building up a frightful stress. It was even getting to Moto. The man was peering through his lenses, and his searching eye was so bugged out that he looked like he was seeing straight through the stomach of Solraheen. 
Seb was close enough to him to hear him whisper, “Curse my Zosan Spark.”
Zosans had a cultural habit of being unlucky.
Young Papi, a scrawny, short, and excitable lad with a ratty face, was squatting nearby behind a stone. He heard Moto’s adumbration too, and he asked the man, “What is it?”
“They’re changing routes,” Moto answered.
“They’re what!?” Papi squeaked.
“We need to move.”
“They’re not coming through here?”
Moto ducked down from his hilltop sight-spot and he tucked his lenses back in their bag. He sat for a moment, elbows on knees, a perfect picture of contemplation, then said, “They were going to come through here, but now they’re not.”
“They changed directions?” Papi’s eyes were as wide as the moon.
Moto didn’t answer. He was back to brooding.
Papi said, “If they changed direction, then you think they know we’re here?”
“We need to move,” Moto repeated as he looked over his shoulder, as if he could see the caravan through the mound of rock. “We need to hop over a few hills.”
Big Rork’s bald, blue-eyed, jug-eared head popped out from behind a boulder to share his opinion on the matter. “We can’t move now!” he said. “The Mazid will see us.”
“We can move if we’re careful,” Moto replied. He flicked his hand in the air as if Rork’s opinion were a fly. “The caravan is still a ways out.”
Rork’s upper lip curled. This wasn’t a natural facial tick, it was something he did because he thought that flashing his teeth made him look fierce. He said, sharply, “If you can see the Mazid, the Mazid can see you.”
Papi added, “We should wait for Elrahet’s smoke.”
The rest of the forty Ayramun were scattered about on either side of the narrow valley, and every one of them was staring up at Moto, Seb, and Rork. None of them below could hear what was being said, but over the years they’d all learned to read body language from afar. Moto was doing a decent job feigning calm, but Papi and Rork’s pained expressions told everyone everything they needed to know. 
Moto picked up his unstrung recurve bow and crawled back up the hilltop.
“Papi’s right,” Seb called after him. “We should wait for the fog to move.”
“Damn waiting for that witch!” Moto cried. “If her shits not here by now, it’s not coming. We need to move.”
“What about Ayram?” Papi asked.
“Yeah,” said Rork. “Where’s Ayram?”
“Let Ayram worry about Ayram.”
From across the valley, Skitter whistled to grab everyone’s attention. Once their gazes were in hand, she pointed up to the Hias mountains behind. There, drifting out of the dark belly of the Junei Pass, was a gray, wispy mist. It was hardly noticeable, but all the same it was there and it was flooding down into the hills, growing thicker by the moment. Elrahet’s magic was coming.
The snooty look in Moto’s eyes evaporated. He beckoned Seb up to him, and Seb scurried close. Moto whispered, “That damned fog is going to make it impossible to mirror that caravan. I’m going to get down to the plain to make sure I know exactly which path through the hills they’re taking. I’m putting you in charge until I get back.”
Seb nodded. Rork overheard and was less enthused. He left his boulder and squat-walked over. “You can’t do that,” he said. “Only Ayram can put someone in charge.”
“I don’t care who’s in charge,” Moto said scornfully. “Just don’t leave this valley. Don’t even think about it.”
There wasn’t anything in Moto’s words for Rork to argue with, though the wild look in his eyes and the veins spidering out of his shaven skull said he was trying to find it. Rork was a man who was always defending his place in the pecking order. The list of men who could give him short shrift was, itself, short—there was Ayram of course, and then barely Moto. No women. Moteah could probably take him if she wanted to try with a sword, but Rork would never admit it. He had a hard enough time admitting that he’d lose a brawl to Ayram. He’d have to be dead sober, and even then it’d be all, ‘you never know’, and ‘if things happened like so-and-so’, and ‘if I were mad real proper, I could kill anything’.
Rork’s hateful eye chased Moto as the man scuttled down the valley slope. At the bottom, Moto dusted off his burnt orange robes and then did a glancing head count to make sure all the Ayramun were where they needed to be. He broke his own law of silence by saying out loud, “Alright, you idiots—sit tight, I’ll be back soon.” Then he turned and ran, disappearing around the valley bend. He was gone in less time than it took Seb to fish another borcandi spine out from her sleeve.
Seb was chewing through her spines at a prodigious rate. Moto’s leaving only made the stress worse. It was never good for discipline when a leader leaves the group, even a much begrudged deputy leader like Moto. Without a man to lead Seb knew it was only a matter of time before someone got a bright idea that needed taming. Seb figured Rork would be the first to act up, because that’s just who he was. Rork rambled back down to his chosen boulder, muttering insults and curses at no one in particular.
“Loosen up, Rork”, said Forty. Forty was an older woman with a rascal’s disposition. She playfully twanged her bow at Rork—a mocking shot at his self-importance. Rork sized up this affront with a puffed-out chest, and said, “Big show. Biiiiig show. But you better be careful, Shorty, ‘cause anything can happen in an ambush. With this mist rolling in, I might not know which way I’m shooting.”
“Same goes for me,” said Forty, tongue only half-in-cheek.
“Pipe down, Sol’s sake,” said Seb.
Forty gave Rork one final fleer, then the two marched apart and settled down to watch Elrahet’s mist bleed out of the mountains. 
The humidity had already reached them, as Seb could smell the pleasant musk of moistened earth. And up in the mountains, the mist was no longer merely a vapor, congealing as it was into a fog magic’d with purpose, spooling out into slender tendrils that slithered down into the hills. Some of these ropes of fog twirled up into the darkening sky, and there the wind caught them, lifted them higher, and splayed them out like fingers. 
A low, rolling drum of distant thunder echoed out from somewhere deep inside the mountains.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” said Papi. Seb agreed. This was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of belly magic. It was, perhaps, too good. If she could see it, then no doubt a Mazid could see it too. What a Mazid would make of it, she could only guess, and just as it was all starting to coalesce into something resembling a natural cloud of fog, a misty fissure snapped into the sky over the mountain peaks, and from it a herd of storm clouds emerged. They crept out slowly, hesitantly, like cautious cattle out of the pen, but once they were out they began to billow as they fed on the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of Elrahet’s sacrificial lizard.
Two fingers later and these storm clouds were blotting out the sun. Their gray shadows spilled down into the valleys, and not long after that the drifting fog mantled the hill behind Seb and fell upon her. Visibility dropped so low that Seb’s near-sightedness was no longer an impairment, for no one else could see much further. They all watched the valley bend to the west, even though it was out of sight, for they all expected that at any moment Moto would come jogging back to get them moving again.
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, little pricklings on the skin, a light peppering of the sandy rock and clay. Soon the raindrops swelled, and in half-a-hand they were plunking gobs of wet. 
“A bit much, isn’t it?” Papi said as he sheltered his beloved bow with his short brown cape. “Don’t she know I can’t shoot no good in the rain?”
“It’ll stop soon,” Seb said.
But it didn’t.
The rain dribbled off the rocks and stony clay, and where there were depressions and scars in the earth the rain was pitter-pattering puddles into being. These puddles grew into boot-swelling pools that overflowed their banks, and streams poured down the valley slopes, following the run of furrows that ancient rains had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millennia. Seb figured this was more water in one short span than this stretch of desert had seen in twenty years. It brought out the lizards—or rather pushed them out. A little gray bonbon popped out of the clay right next to Seb’s boot. Its swiveling eye looked mightily confused by the sudden downpour. It was so flustered that it didn’t have time to notice Seb’s heel coming down on its head. 
Seb looked over to young Papi. The boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers.
“Might as well be swimming,” the boy said. “Damn this goddamn rain!”
The curse was hardly out his lips when a gnarled flash of white lightning split through the iron mist above.

CRACKA-BOOM!

A chorus of startled yelps echoed out from the Ayramun.
Papi looked like he’d shat himself. “Elrahet’s never conjured more than a mist!” he squealed.
Tizm, a gray-scruffed old-timer stationed across the valley grumbled out, “That old bitch is gonna get us killed!”
“Where’s Moto?” came another ragged voice out of the rain.
“Screw that,” said another. “Where’s Ayram?”
From there the Ayramun began to bicker. The specific charges and insults being thrown across the valley weren’t anything new, but the stress and fear had softened everyone up so that the simplest ‘eat my shit’ cut deep. If it weren’t for the rain dampening their fighting spirit, there might have been a brawl.
Seb didn’t begrudge them their bellyaches. They’d been fed a raw meal. None of them were prepared for this kind of weather. The ground under her butt was getting slick and muddy, and if it rained any harder it would be difficult to shoot a bow because the wetter her bowstring got, the more it lost its spring. And there was no telling what a pounding rain would do to an arrow’s flight because Seb had never shot in such conditions. She knew enough to know that it wouldn’t help. For an ambush where everything had to go right, this was downright bad.
Seb began to brood and boil, but she caught herself in the act—she was torturing herself with expectations.
She needed to recenter herself.
Things weren’t bad. They weren’t good, either, but they weren’t bad.
That kind of thinking, that breaking the world into ‘good’ and ‘bad’, that was a symptom of expectations. The truth was that everything was happening exactly as it was supposed to happen.
Seb closed her eyes and thumbed a short chain of bone beads that she kept stashed in her robe, and as she did, she chanted a prayer to try and repress her simmering frustration.
	
	A well without water
		is filled with purpose,
	An arrow in the dirt
		has hit its mark,
	There is no difference
		below the surface,
	There is no self
		above the Spark.

She repeated this five, ten times as she drew her shoulders in against the rain. This plunking rain. This purpose-driven rain. The fog, the bickering, these were purposeful too—to what end, Seb wasn’t sure, but now that she was looking for purpose she could sense a great deal of it, and it was brewing something terrible. Yes, the Ayramun were about to intersect with destiny—but no—that was wrong to say, for destiny is ever-present. They were always intersecting with it. There were no bit-part players here. Poor and ragged as they may seem, these Ayramun were people, and all peoples were descendants of the first man and first woman, an unbroken chain being forged for a millennia. Each soggy, grumpy face was the culmination of a hundred thousand generations of toil, the same generations as the Hrkan Lords themselves, and so each was as important, as Lordly, for if one of them was missing then events would not unfold as they were meant to. 
But she shouldn’t privilege the living. If the rock under her feet did not exist then she would not be crouching here, she would be crouching somewhere else, and thus the future, bounded by lines of immanence extending from the present, would wind a different weave. Yes, this very rock was sacred, as all things are sacred, as the dead lizard under her boot was sacred. All things are filled with the Spark’s sacred power.
“Seb! Quit your fartin’ about!”
“What!?”
The call had come from Rork. He and a few other miserable looking louts were down on the valley floor, straddling either side of a trickling stream that was building up in the middle of the valley’s run. Seb was about to chastise them for doing Sol-knows-what when she noticed that Moto had returned and was standing in their midst. Seb leapt to her feet and filtered down the valley slope with the rest of the Ayramun. 
Down in the valley’s belly, Moto face was alight with an excitement that no one shared.
“What’s wrong with you people?” he asked. “We’re about to bag us a Mazid and you look mad about it.”
Tizm, the bent-backed wonder, kicked at the swelling stream and pointed to the sky and shouted, “The old bitch has overcooked it!”
A refrain of agreement rained down. A few voices shushed, then others shushed back. Moto tried to calm them all with plaintive hands, saying, “People. Please.”
“Please my ass!” said Tizm. “This rain is gonna ruin everything!”
“The rain is perfect,” said Moto. “It’s got the Hrks hunkered down in a valley finger.”
“The Hrks?” asked Papi.
“Yes,” said Moto with a wary grin. “It’s Hrks we’re hunting. Hrkan Skulsi.”
The admission that it was Skulsi, not Blackwood caravan men, sent a wave of discontent rippling through the gathered Ayramun. Moto tried to stem the unease by lying. Seb knew it was a lie because when Moto was working through a big lie he’d smile and whine at the same damn time, like people’s doubting faces were annoying to him. “They’ve gone and lined themselves up against a wall for us,” he said. “Jumping them will be the easiest thing in the world, but we’ve got to hurry.”
Someone on the outer edge of the huddle blurted out, “What’s this about Hrks?”
Moto raised his voice above the rain. “The Minder and his Mazid didn’t come with a Blackwood caravan. They came with a Hrkan guard.”
Another round of shouting broke out, punctuated by a flustered shout, “They know we’re here! They’ve come for us!”. Then came another round of shushing and counter-shushing. Moto again tried to calm those gathered with nothing but his frantic hands. In the end he resorted to a sharp whistle, which shut everyone right up.
Moto said sharply, “The fact that it’s Hrks doesn’t change a damned thing.”
Rork’s bald head stuck up above the huddle like a veiny, boiled egg floating in a stew. He said, “All the better it’s Skulsi! I’d rather kill a Hrk than a Jandri man!” 
Moto nodded and said, “They’re bedded down like rabbits in a long, straight ravine.”
“The one with all the karkle bushes?” Seb asked.
“They’ve all got karkle bushes in them,” Moto replied.
“The valley we’re standing in don’t.”
“It doesn’t matter,” said Moto. “All we have to do is sneak up and shoot some Hrks. It’ll be the easiest thing in the world. I know it’s raining hard, but I’m not asking you to feather an eye at ten-score yards. With this rain and fog we can get up close. You won’t miss. You can throw stones at them if you want to. You can stuff mud down their throats if you want to.”
“Where’s Ayram?” asked another.
 Frustration flashed across Moto’s face and he shot a beseeching look to the heavens before saying, “This is happening whether Ayram’s here or not. Whether you like it or not. And it’s happening now, before this rain and fog let up. Let’s get moving!”
He turned and pushed his way past a few Ayramun and set off back towards the bend. After the briefest hesitation, Big Rork marched after him, and at his encouragement, everyone else followed. Together they were a small, sad herd of outland pokes, a jumble of soggy wool-wrapped bodies and tired feet slapping the mud beside the building stream.
Seb kept to the back as they eventually climbed up and out of the valley and then crossed over a few others. They tramped through a flooding basin, and all the while Seb eyed the rainy mist with unease, for she could feel providence at work in that mist. Unlike the providence that people pray for and expect, this providence was providing something undesired, Seb was sure of that. Destructidence is what it was. Deathidence. There wasn’t an established word for it, which itself was a telling sign of the plundering spirit of the age. People only cared about signs of Solraheen’s plan so long as it was giving them something good. These Ayramun were no different.
Eventually Gugi found his way to Seb at the back of the wandering troupe. The skinny man’s face was agog with fear. He clearly wanted to talk, so Seb indulged him.
“Whaddya want?” Seb asked.
“Ya know where we headed, right?”
“I do.”
“It’s that cursed ravine, the one where I found those bones!”
“I know.”
“You should say somethin’ to the others.”
“Why not you?”
“I don’t ever say shit so no one’s gonna listen to me.”
“They won’t listen to me either.”
“They would. I would. That ravine is cursed, and people are gonna die if we get down in it.”
“I thought you said if we moved that body out of that ravine, then the curse would be moved out with it?”
“What do I know about curses? I was just sayin’ shit. For all I know that curse is what brought this storm and lured them Hrks down in it.”
“Are you tryin’ to get out of payin’ me my spines?” Seb asked accusingly.
Gugi spat a wad of borcandi juice right where Seb was stepping, clearly upset that Seb could think about debts in a time like this. Before he could voice that concern, a muted horse’s whinny was heard through the splashing rain. Everyone instinctively crouched down and rushed to the shelter of the nearest sloping mound. They were still a few-score yards away from the ravine where the Hrks were sheltering. Nothing of those troops could be seen through the mist.
Moto raced back down the line of Ayramun to crouch down next to Seb and Gugi. Voice low, he asked, “You two scouted this ravine, right?”
Gugi and Seb both nodded.
“Anything we should know about it?”
“It’s cursed,” Gugi blurted out. “We shouldn’t be here.”
“Cursed? What do you mean, cursed?”
Seb said, “This the ravine that had those bones.”
Moto snorted, almost laughed, then said, “Screw those bones. I need to know the lay of the land. I can’t see through this damned mist so I don’t know if there’s an easy out for them up on the northern side.”
“Moto,” Gugi said, leaning into his words, “I’m tellin’ you, this place is cursed. It’s gonna get us killed.”
“So what? If it’s cursed for us, it’s cursed for them too. Doubly so for them, cause they’re sitting in it.”
“Yeah, but we the ones who found the bones! We the ones that been warned! Not them. Us! Me!”
Moto gave up on Gugi and turned to Seb. “Is there any way in and out of that long stretch that might make it easy for them?”
Seb shook her head no. “That stretch is mostly steep. There’s one little nook on the north side that’s kinda like a stair but that’s it.” 
“How wide?”
“Not that wide.”
Moto paused to think, then said, “I want you two to go back a ways, and cross to the north side where you think it’s safe. Then work your way back down to where that stair is.”
“Just us two?” Gugi asked.
Moto turned and motioned towards his sister, Moteah, who was not at all enthused to be at her brother’s beck and call. Like Moto, she carried herself with an air of authority, though she was even more arrogant about it than her upfront brother, a bit cheeky, considering she was about eight years younger.
Moto looked her square in the eyes, “Get Rork and twelve others to follow Seb and Gugi. You’re going to set up on the other side of the ravine, and we’re going to try and push the Hrks towards you. So be quick and be ready. There won’t be a whistle. When they come, they come.” 
Moteah snuck away, gathered up Rork and the nearest twelve Ayramun, then brought them to Seb and Gugi. Gugi wasn’t about to take charge, so Seb crowned herself and led them all back towards the mountains, keeping the course of the cursed ravine a small-score yards away to his right. When she felt they’d gone far enough, she led them sliding down into the steep ravine, and then they had a tough, nervy scramble back up the other side. Once up, they headed back towards the plain, keeping low and quiet.
Seb knew the place she was looking for, but with the rain and mist there was no way she’d find the spot until she was already upon it. The fog was so thick that she kept second guessing whether she was even following the right ravine. Nonetheless she kept going, one foot in front of the other, trying not to think too much about the fight that was only a finger away. Soon, she was confronted with the sound of snorting wagon ponies drinking their fill of rainwater.
She crouched down, and the rest Ayramun behind did likewise. She ambled over to the edge of the ravine and slithered up against a big, solid boulder that leaned over the ravine’s lip. From there she could hear horse hooves stamping in the ravine’s stream, and if a horse was that close, then a Hrk might be closer. When she heard the clank of wood on wood she couldn’t help herself from peeking, so she steeled her nerves and peered over the boulder.
Right below her was a horse still hitched to a wagon whose bed was covered by a canvas stretched taught above the boards. Behind this wagon was another horse and another covered wagon, and whatever was behind that was lost to the mist. There was only one man. He was a natural Hrk, so far as Seb could tell, a natural Hrk with redblack hair and a full black beard that made his head seem massive. Clad in sopping wet browns, he was darting between the wagons, prepping them against the rain with all the urgency of a fellow who knew the curse that water puts on a wagon that’s been drawing dry. He drove himself insane as he scampered through the rain and fumbled with the little canvas tents that were ready-tied just above each wagon wheel. He snapped one of these sheets over a wheel-hub, and in his rush to get to another he slipped and bumped against the wagon’s boards, and this juddering loosed the latch which pinned the tailgate. The tailgate popped open, and the wagon pooped out a dead body which plopped into the mud.
It was a dead Jandri boy in a white tunic.
Seb turned to her troupe behind her. The confusion on her face must have been easy to read because Rork grumbled and invited himself up to Seb’s rock. The man kept his vein-strapped head tucked against the rock’s hump as he peered out around it.
Rork’s jaw dropped upon seeing the wagons and the lonesome wagonmaster, as well the dead body. His bulging eyes searched for some sign of the actual enemy, but found none.
“Whore’s breath,” he muttered.
Moteah joined Rork and Seb at the boulder and quietly stole a look for herself. Her usually uptight expression didn’t show the slightest hint of concern.
“What are they hauling dead bodies for?” Rork asked her in a whisper.
“Why would I know?” Moteah answered.
“Cause your brother’s the one who went scouting.”
“Do I look like Moto to you?”
“Yeah, you do,” said Rork. “If’n he sprouted tits I couldn’t tell you two apart.”
Moteah’s brow tightened even further. This wasn’t anger. Moteah called it ‘severe disinterest’. It was one of her two expressions, the other being plain old disinterest. Problem was, that look wasn’t a good way to deal with a man like Rork. The best thing to do was to pretend not to notice him, even ignore him altogether. Unfortunately for Moteah, she was too young and fresh to get away with that either. To a man like Rork, her wrinkled brow was nothing but shirred meat, and the rest of her was an annoying robe.
“Bitch is leadin’ us into a trap,” he whispered to the others.
“I’m not leading anyone anywhere. Seb is.”
Seb felt the eyes of both these schemers bear down upon her. 
“Don’t lookit me,” she whispered back. “I didn’t set this up.”
They were still looking at her.
Seb pointed east, in the direction of the Junei Plain. “There’s a overhang in the ravine down a ways. It could do as a cave. It could be that the Hrks have taken it up.” 
“Seb, you’re a soilbucket.” Rork’s voice was uncomfortably loud. “This is a goddamned trap if I ever seen one. I bet my uglies they know we’re here.” 
Rork faced the cloud of mist from which they’d come, and he cast his suspicious eye about, as if the dark boulders lurking in the haze were really Hrkan Skulsi in disguise. He unwrapped his tall bow from its cow-leather strap and strung it with an easy flick. The rest of the Ayramun caught on to his excitement, and they strung their bows in kind. Then all thirteen of them, Gugi included, crept up to join Seb, Moteah, and Rork at the lip of the ravine. When their fists were full of arrows, Rork decided that the time was right to strike. He gave his bow a pull to test the string, and then he stood up and loosed an arrow at the unaware wagonmaster.
The arrow didn’t have far to go. Almost as soon as the fletching was free from Rork’s fingers the arrowhead was implanting itself into the back of that Hrkan neck. The man clutched and gurgled, then fell to his knees and splashed down face-first into the budding rainwater stream. Downstream, one of the horses whinnied and stamped when it found its drink suddenly awash with blood.
Rork ducked back behind the boulder and gave Seb a contented grin, like he’d just won the battle all by himself. Then they waited. Moto had said there wouldn’t be a whistle, so they had to wait for the battle straight. They waited for at least a full finger, and by then the rain started to let up and the sound of the ravine’s running water was louder than the plunks which poured from the sky.
Having had enough of waiting, Rork made to climb down into the ravine.
Seb caught the hem of his robe and pulled him back.
“What are you doing?” Seb rasped.
“There’s no one here,” Rork sneered.
“Moto said wait!”
Rork stretched his arms out to gesture at all the nothingness around them. “Wait for what?”
“A signal.”
“Signal to do what? What are we ambushing, horses?”
One of the Ayramun, a young one named Ritt, popped his head up. “There’s Hrks down there somewhere, I feel it.”
“Quiet down!” Moteah snipped.
But much to Moteah’s dismay, and Seb’s amazement, Rork stood straight up and put his finger and his thumb to his lips and whistled out a three-chirp alarm—bright and sharp. The sound cut through the falling mist of rain as easily as if it weren’t there at all. The horse’s ears swiveled as they regarded Rork with some confusion, and before anyone could stop him, Rork scrambled down to the bottom of the ravine, arrow knocked. When his feet slapped onto flat ground, he crouched and waited for something to happen, and when nothing did, he growled a curse and shot an arrow into the back of the already dead Hrk. 
“I’m not stayin’ here no longer,” he said.
With that, Rork marched across the ravine and tossed his bow up onto the other side and started to climb out.
Moteah swept up in Seb’s periphery and shot an arrow right at him.
In clean dry air a gull-feather arrow with a whistling nock would trill with excitement when released, but soggy as it was, Moteah’s arrow flew across the ravine with nary a whine. Rork had no idea what hit him, and it hit him right between the blades, and it burrowed deep to nick the heart. He fell backwards, back into the ravine, and he was limp dead before he even hit the ground.
Seb gasped. It was against the rules to even scratch one of their own, even a throbbing cock like Rork. Killing an Ayramun was a privilege reserved for Ayram.
Before Seb could get out a word, Moteah grabbed her by the breast of her robe and yanked her down behind the boulder. Seb twisted the girl’s hand away and held it firm in her wiry grip.
“What’d ya kill him for!?”
Moteah put her finger to her lips and shushed. Seb grimaced then spat the whole borcandi blob that had been stewing in her cheek. She spat it right at Moteah’s face, but quick as a cat, Moteah ducked out of its terrifying arc and the wad landed with a splat on Gugi’s chest. Gugi squealed in disgust as he flicked the gooey gunk away. Moteah clapped his mouth shut with her free hand and her eyes flared caution at both of them. She pointed with her chin to the opposite bank and mouthed a silent warning—Hrks.
Seb let go of Moteah’s wrist and peered around the boulder. There across the ravine were two shawled figures wandering out of the mist. At first she took them for Ayramun, but the first of them made a foreign gesture towards the other, and when Seb saw a flash of white under one of their ruddy cloaks she knew for sure—these were Hrkan men.
The two figures paused, cocked their heads towards Seb like they’d felt her thoughts ripple the fog between them, and they dropped down flat against the ground.
Seb ducked fast behind her boulder. She turned to Moteah and had to restrain herself from shouting.
“They know!”
The sound was hardly out her mouth when from behind them, on their own safe side of the ravine, a Hrkan horn of war thrilled the air.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommmm

Hrkan battle horns are deep and drooping bleats that tremble the bones of even the most well armored lizards, and Seb was clad in nothing but rags. When the horn blast jumped up behind her it startled her out of her skin. She yelped and swore and swiveled around to face the terror, and there, deep in the fog, running right towards her, was a blurry host of men, Hrkan Skulsi, white coats flashing bright under brown disguises. Maybe twenty or more of them.
They moved in silence, a leggy, white speckled blob, all business, just jogging right up like they were lost and about to ask for the way to the road. They didn’t try to intimidate with screams and yells, for in truth they were killers, not soldiers. The power of the Mazidai had long made armies obsolete, so the kind of professional fighting man that the Hrkan world breeds is one who lusts for the frenzy of small skirmishes where the pain of death is anesthetized in glory whenever man proves himself against man.
The horn bleated again.

BWEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooommmm

The Skulsi blob began to sprint. 
Seb felt a strange warmth running down her thigh and she realized that she’d pissed herself. Moteah loosed an arrow at the running blob and before the girl saw the results, she took off sprinting west, back up along the ravine and towards the mountains. Seb took off after her, and the rest of the Ayramun followed. They trimmed the ravine, pursued by that mob of Hrks, while on the opposite bank those two Hkran cloaks had somehow multiplied into twenty. They shadowed the Ayramun, silent like the others, and they bunched up against the ravine as they waited for the terrain to present an opportunity to close the gap and kill. Seb nocked an arrow mid stride and shot it across, but it flew harmlessly into the mist. Others had more luck—Gugi put an arrow through the leading man’s leg, and the man behind him was struck down when an arrow rammed into the side of his skull. The two figures crumpled to the ground and those behind bumbled over them, but this did little to slow the chase. 
Then Moteah jumped down into the ravine.
Seb wondered what insanity could have possessed the girl to give those Hrkan Skulsi a leaping chance, when in the next instant, a thin, golden beam of Mazidfire came ripping right by her ear.
The line of this blazing fire screamed out in the misty distance, and like a sword it began to swipe. Seb ducked low and avoided its arc, but the men behind her weren’t so lucky. The fire ran right through the back of Gugi’s head and burst out of his eye-socket as if his brains and bone weren’t there. His body slumped down, and the fireline’s distant fulcrum swiveled, sending the beam of death swiping downwards through the air, cutting four Ayramun into uneven halves before smashing into the earth, its tremendous heat sizzling the soggy clay as it went.
Then as suddenly as the Mazidfire came, it was gone, it went roaring into earth, leaving in its wake charred flesh, black glass, glowing stone, and smoke.
Those still alive threw themselves down the ravine’s steep slope. Seb bumped into a karkle bush on the way down and rolled uncontrollably to the bottom where she flopped belly-first onto the muddy ground and slid with a splash into the ravine’s nascent stream. The rest of the Ayramun were already scrambling to their feet and fleeing along after Moteah. Seb stayed put, for there in front of her eyes was the very bush she’d seen that morning—the bush from under which she’d pulled those accursed bones. Its black twigs bloomed above her like a monument to fate. Her mind was unpinned by the significance of it, and she felt that awesome humbling chill which only comes when one catches a glimpse of the divine plan.
She tried to reel back in by telling herself this bush was just a bush—no more or less a major player in the divine plan as the mud squishing against her stomach, or even Ayram himself. Yes, this bush was just a bush.
And yet…
And yet she was supposed to crawl up under that bush and so she did. She crawled up under it, and she lay herself down where those bones had been, and she watched through the brambles as the Hrks descended upon her straggling companions.
Ten of the leaping Hrks were shot down by arrows before their feet landed in the ravine, yet the Skulsi, undaunted, charged on. Their feet flung mud as their powerful strides closed the distance as fast as swept-backs. Seb cowered under the bush lest the obligation of battle came to her. Her gut turned at the sight of one man sticking his boot on the back of her comrade’s head, suffocating him in the mud. But the Ayramun were valiant, and this cruelty was paid in turn with a knife stuck through the gut. 
 Seb could not see much of the battle, but she heard its sounds well enough. Metal clanged, mud-caked fists smacked faces with squelching thumps, sharp elbows cracked against ribs. No doubt that fling of limb and muck was rich with fighting deeds that warranted songs. Side whittled side until a Skulsi gave a gruff shout to stop—there was only one Ayramun left, and the man who shouted claimed the right of single combat. The rest of the Hrks ran off into the fog to search for more pokes to poke.
Seb watched through blurred vision as the last two mud-caked combatants sized each other amongst the smattering of corpses. Both were wounded and breathing hard with blades held out before them. By this point the rain had stopped. Seb felt the itch of purpose stirring in her stomach. Perhaps the bush had reserved her for this very moment, for here was an opportunity for decisive action, and that was all anyone could ever ask for—clarity of cause and effect—the outcome of a skirmish turned with her.
Seb twisted out from under her bush to fire an arrow at the man she took to be a Hrk, but just as she did, two figures stepped up to the lip of the ravine above her. The shorter one opened its mouth and a golden beam of Mazidfire burst out, cutting both combatants in two.
Seb froze in fear at the sight of the Mazid and its Minder. She scuffled back up under her bush.
She had never seen a Mazid before, and she couldn’t see much of it now. It was shorter than its Minder by a good foot, the height of a youth. It was skinny, and its gangly self was wrapped up in blue robes and a blue cowl like a penitent priest. Seb couldn’t see the eyes, only the general gauntness of its face, which was white as sea foam, like the creature had been dipped in cream. Seb squinted to try to get a better look because it didn’t appear to have any hair. Its chin was smooth and hairless as an egg, and its brows were shaven. The Minder was a normal Jandri man, dressed in the standard scribal robes—a richer, brighter blue with a blue hooded cape that blanketed his broad shoulders like a pelt.
Another man joined the two figures up on that bank. Unlike the others, he was a natural born Hrk through and through—blackred hair, greying around the temples, with copper skin and eyebrows so thick they could flog lizard skin. His dark cloak was held together by a silver sunrose brooch—the mark of military command, and underneath this cloak were the white robes of a Skulsi. This captain marched up to the much shorter Mazid, and he bore a look of such contempt that he seemed about to strike.
“Explain yourself!” the captain shouted as he pointed to the two sizzling corpses down in the ravine.
“I don’t know what you mean,” said the Mazid, meekly.
The captain chafed at the Mazid’s play of ignorance. “You killed one of my men.”
“I didn’t know which was which.”
“So you killed both?!” The captain then turned on the Mazid’s Minder. “I don’t know how you people breed these things, but something is wrong. Each one is dumber than the last.”
The Minder had a dark, square face and a patch of hair which crawled underneath his bottom lip, and when he clicked his tongue at the captain, the patch curled, underlining his annoyance. “You preach to the choir,” he said. “You’ve only had to deal with the Mazid for a week, whereas I am bonded to it.”
“You’re half the problem. You’re supposed to control it!”
“This is a difficult breed. The Lords say they’re balancing intelligence with docility, but then they bind me to this Mazid, which is neither intelligent nor amenable to instruction, and when I complain they tell me to bear it like I’ve been trained. So bear it, captain—those are not my words, but the words of the Lords.”
The Skulsi captain looked about ready to strangle them both. The Minder shrugged him off and said to his Mazid, “Apologize to the captain.”
“Apologize!?” the captain fumed. “What use do I have for an apology? Tell me, what can I do with it?”
“You can—”
“Don’t answer!”
The Minder shrugged again. In his right hand was a short rod of wood wrapped in braided leather. He held it up to the captain and said, “You may hit it if you like. It won’t hurt the creature as it doesn’t feel pain, but I find it works out my frustrations nonetheless.”
The captain took the rod firm in hand.
“Avoid the head and neck,” said the Minder. “And obviously, the stomach.”
The captain swung the rod and brought it down hard on the Mazid’s shoulder socket. A smack rang out, and the Mazid’s arm sunk down and went limp, clearly dislocated. Though the blow was brutal, Seb winced more than the Mazid did.
The Captain stepped back to appreciate the bludgeoning. “They don’t make Mazidai like they used to,” he said.
“They don’t.”
“It’s a wonder the Lords make use of these things at all. They’ve long outlived their utility. We Skulsi can handle outlaws on our own.”
The scribal Minder clicked his tongue at this remark. “Captain,” he said with disdain, “the only reason you are dealing with outlaws at all is because outland tribes are too whipped by the Mazidai to become anything more than outlaws. Get rid of my office and my charge, and you might find yourself on the front line of a real battle.”
“What do you mean, a real battle?”
“I meant no disrespect.”
“Sounded like disrespect.”
“I assure you, I meant no disrespect.”
Though Seb could not see well, she could see that the captain was about to explode. Every fiber of his Skulsi discipline was snapping.
The Minder drew his lips tight. “If you’ve something foul to say, then let’s have it out.”
The old captain glowered at both the Minder and the Mazid. “Remember that you are here to make things easier for me, not the other way around. And I’d say that killing my men outright is a violation of that mission. Worthy of censure! If you were not a Minder, I would have had you burned out for incompetency!”
The Minder was unimpressed. “If I were not a Minder you could do all manner of things. But fantasies are the domain of children and beggars, not soldiers who stand up straight. White light, we speak of the decline of the Mazidai, but if you are Hrkan Skulsi then I worry doubly for the Lordship.”
“You have a problem with me?”
“I do. Look at you—pomped up like you deserve something better than what you have, like you don’t understand that I can speak to you how I want. Worry about yourself, captain, lest that self-important stomach growl too loudly and forget the station of its Spark.”
“You’d threaten a captain of the Skulsi!?”
“I would if he threatened a Minder and his Mazid.”
The captain smirked, then put his hands on his hips and eyed the Minder with a gleam of amusement. “I doubt you have the control,” he said. “Just the other day one of my men saw your Mazid let an outland poke run free. It could have easily burned the man down, but it didn’t.”
“That man went free because the Mazid doesn’t control the fire. I do.”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean exactly what I said.”
The captain’s face screwed up as he slowly put two and two together. “Are you saying you killed my man?”
“I didn’t know which was which,” said the Minder as he cracked a sly grin.
The captain’s jaw dropped in shock. “Wait until Lord Gagan hears about this! He’ll have you out in the pastures where you belong, minding sheep not Mazidai!”
The Minder countenanced the captain’s threat with a skeptical brow. Seb could sense the man’s stinging smugness even from beneath her karkle bush. 
Then the Minder said to the Mazid, “Kill that man.”
The Mazid’s throat glowed gold and in a flash its mouth was ablaze with the fire of gods as a thin beam of golden light shot out. A heartbeat later, the captain crumpled to the ground. In the place where his forehead used to be was a black and smoldering hole. What was left of his face was fixed in hurtled surprise.
The Minder grunted in satisfaction before regarding his Mazid with contempt. “Don’t you ever think about what you want or don’t want. You don’t have wants. Get creative with my orders again and I’ll have us both sent back to the guild for—”
His words were interrupted by the act of the Mazid shuffling towards the ravine’s lip. Shock dawned on his face as the creature began to climb down into the ravine.
“What are you doing?” the Minder spat, but the Mazid did not answer. It had reached the ravine’s belly and was walking towards Seb’s bush. It was close enough now that Seb could see its gaunt visage clearly—a ghoul of a person, with silver, empty, Sparkless eyes.
“Stop!” the Minder commanded with a shout. His word shook the Mazid’s spine. It paused, struggled a step, then continued on as if laden with chains.
The Minder stretched out his left arm, which was missing a hand. The stubby wrist wrapped in white cotton and ornamented with golden trinkets affixed in a net of delicate golden chains. He pointed this jangling nub at the Mazid and screamed, “STOP!”
The shout was so strong it had form and purpose, it punched the simpering rain and exploded out to clear a bubble of dry air into existence, flinging the raindrops out of it, sending them spraying over Seb’s bush and the world beyond. Indeed, the shout was so strong that it wrenched Seb’s own Spark in her stomach, and it struck the Mazid with a crippling force, as every single muscle in the creature’s scrawny body snapped taut as if snagged by time. This creature tilted, unbalanced, and when the bubble of rain collapsed and a blanket of water fell, the Mazid fell too, stiff as stone, splashing onto the muddy ground. It landed without much heft, like it was a blanket tossed.
Though it was still against its will, its gray eyes remained unnervingly alert. They swiveled in their sockets and found Seb inside her bush, and Seb lay transfixed. In Seb’s long journeys through the Sand she had looked every manner of creature in the eye, and in each of them she’d found some sort of kinship—not so when she beheld the pale-white, bald, browless, lashless, silver-eyed Mazid.
Her fixation on this creature was broken when the Minder climbed down into the belly of the ravine. This short effort put the man out of breath, and he stood still for a moment before marching over to the Mazid and giving it a probing kick. The Mazid was stiff as a board. The Minder cursed his own luck, then picked the limb-bent creature up, put it upon his shoulder, and began to walk away. He was almost lost in the mist when Seb scrunched out of her bush and drew her boot knife.
 She crept along, making extra sure she didn’t slop too loudly in the muck as she closed the distance to the Minder’s misty figure. Stalking a man with his back turned triggered Seb’s instinct for the hunt, and she matched the Minder’s footfalls and kept herself ready to leap. Excitement swelled when the Minder strolled past the bodies of Rork and the Hrkan wagonmaster, for there were also horses to hide her noise.
She picked up her pace. The first horse eyed her dumbly, oblivious to her murderous pursuit. Soon she was only yards away from the Minder, and when Seb could no longer contain herself, she screamed such a deep and wild scream that it surprised even herself.
The Minder dropped his burden in fright. Seb plunged her knife into the man’s flinching shoulder. She yanked it out and the blade blurred against the back-swinged arc of blood before getting lost altogether as Seb rushed through a flurry of blows. The Minder twisted and fell into the sticky mud. He tried to scramble free, tried to shove aside her fury, but the man had only one good hand. He raised his ornamented forearm to shield his face, but Seb’s knife was there between the golden chains, and it was there again between the ribs, and there in the stomach, and in the neck, then cutting through the bone in his flailing elbow. Seb jabbed at the man’s throat, and jabbed again, and again, and she did not let up until her knife slipped out of her hand from the glut of blood.
A few gratuitous punches later, and the Minder was dead.
Seb sat back on the dead man’s waist and admired the kill. It wasn’t clean, but the struggle had been quick, one-sided, and glorious. Seb admired her ultimate prize, the pale Mazid, who lay limp in the mud behind. Its eyes were stilled and its body was dead, as it was no longer bound to any will. The sight of it settled Seb into the realization that she’d succeeded where all the other Ayramun had failed, and an exultant cheer welled up in her stomach. She made to let loose victory, but her shout was chilled by the sight of a short, irascible pillar of black rags standing only a few yards away.
It was the old witch Elrahet.
Some unseemly witchness had swept the woman down from her mountain cave, and there she stood in the mist. Her dark eyes quested the muddy ground, ignoring Seb and her glory. She followed some unseen trail towards the Hrkan wagon, and she hobbled over to it. Once there, she used her gnarled cane to prod at the body which had fallen out of the wagon’s bed.
Seb quickly gathered herself up, and the limp Mazid as well, and hustled over to the witch to show off her prize. She held the Mazid’s body out as an offering, expecting praise, but Elrahet merely glanced and nodded. She was more concerned with the dead Jandri youth at her feet and the wagon itself, which was packed to the boards with more dead Jandri youths. They’d been crammed inside the bed like poached pigs. Elrahet knocked one of their dangling arms with her cane and said, in her sneering way, “The Amalgamete has outgrown its suckling chin.”
The sight of so many bodies unsettled Seb’s stomach, even though she herself was coated in mud and the blood of a man she had just stabbed to pieces.
“They’re not dead,” Elrahet said scornfully. “I can smell their Sparks, cursed to the flesh. Look.” The dead boy at her feet was half-slipped from his white tunic, revealing his legs and uglies. Elrahet poked him in the stomach with her cane to drag the tunic further up, revealing a raspberry ring of darkness welling up under the skin and circling his belly-button.
“He was meant for food,” Elrahet said.
“Food?” Seb asked.
“Food for the Amalgamete. We’ve not caught our Mazid a moment too soon, for the beast is grown enough to eat.”
“You sure?”
Elrahet sneered at the implication that she could possibly be wrong. “Give me the Mazid,” the Old witch snipped.
Seb lay the Mazid’s blanket-weight on the witch’s stooped shoulder.
“And you take the boy.”
“What?” Seb asked.
“Pick up the boy and carry him.”
“Why?”
Elrahet did not answer, for she never answered a question like, ‘why’. ‘Why’ was asked of people who could not see the threads of purpose which weave a certain future. Elrahet could see them. It was rumored that she’d weaved some of them herself.
Elrahet waddled away, down the ravine. Her wet rags dragged behind and scraped the mud, leaving a slug-like trail behind as she bore the Mazid into the mist.
Seb picked up the skinny boy and followed. </Text>

Change Covo in Minder/Captain to Obo isn’t in control of the Mazidfire.</Notes>

        <Document ID="F7126261-7AF4-4AE8-BA1D-F4CFDA99FC53">
            <Title>Ch22 - Merge</Title>
            <Text>There were three people in Ayram’s backpack. Two were dead—Obo and the Riga—and their elbows, shoulders, wrists, and hips bulged the bottom leather. Elrahet sat on top of them, her head was poked out the top, ancient but very much alive. She glared out at the rest of the Ayramun who lagged behind.
“Faster!” she barked. 
The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a wide canyon valley, but Ayram’s pace was furious, and he scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree, and Mandri had a hard time following. At the top was a shelf of sturdy rock, and they bumbled along this parallel road for a finger until it dead ended into a crack which ran right through a solid wall of reddish stone. The crack’s opening was hardly an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders, but Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
 Mandri’s arms and legs bumped and scraped against the striated walls, layers of red and off-red rock stacked on top each other composed dramatic sweeping forms that towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky. The sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he ran along, and such was the height and cant of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mushy pile of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
Mandri might have savored the scene if he wasn’t having such a hard time keeping up with the blistering pace. The way twisted and bent, right and left, and he was so far behind that he rarely caught a glimpse of Purl, much less anyone else beyond her. He was chasing the sounds of their paddling feet, and that was enough until he was confronted with a fork in the path. The Ayramun had charged ahead without sparing care for him.
Mandri forced himself up and he scuttled onwards, finding untapped energy in his legs. This new path curved around and almost ran back on itself, then gradually meandered north. The way was rough, and soon a whole hand had passed, measured out by the oppressive eye of the sun as it crossed the thin bridge of blue above. The air was heating up, and unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off Mandri’s skin the moment it beaded up. He ran on and on, and the longer he ran, the soggier his robe and brow became. Few feelings are more uncomfortable than that of a soggy lower back being patted by a heavy pack. The vortex of steamy air that emerged there in that gap was a weather system unto itself, and this self-sustaining convection current, shaped by the contours of muscle and spine, was there to stay as he didn’t have time to throw off his pack, rip off his shirt, and rag himself dry.

“No backtalk—and that goes for you too, Seb. You been getting uppity these days, and it’s time to stop.”
Seb scoffed at this sudden turn. 
“I don’t backtalk,” he said. “I give suggestions.”
“No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
When Ayram was confident that Seb had absorbed enough of his ire to fall in line, he turned again to Mandri.
“You understand?”
Mandri nodded.
“Say it.”
“I understand.”
“Good—but for now you’ll be following Moto.”
Moto perked up. “Me? Where are you going?”
“I’m going to scout for the Hrks,” said Ayram. Then he added, smiling, “and if I happen to smash a demon’s skull on the way, then the world is better for it.”
“Where you want to meet up?”
“Greskalun or no Greskalun, we’re going to Shulgi. If the Mazyd was right, it will be empty. We’ll meet up there, in the highest columned room. If you’re not there, don’t worry…I’ll find you.”
With that, he grabbed his iron spear and leapt up the western slope, jumping from rock to rock with a dexterous, grace that defied his giant frame.
His leaving left an uneasy silence which stayed unbroken until Elrahet growled in disappointment. Without Ayram to carry her, she’d have to walk.
She climbed out of the pack and stretched her legs.
“Whose going to carry these two?” She asked, kicking the bag of bodies.
Moto, standing a little straighter now that he was in charge, said, “I think it’s time Mandri pulled his own weight.”
Moto reached down into Ayram’s pack and pulled out Obo’s pale and lifeless corpse by the neck. Then he grabbed Mandri’s litter and stuffed Obo into it as best he could.
“I’ll carry Obo,” Mandri said, “but I’m telling you, I cannot carry both of them. My back is already near breaking.”
Moto froze, looked Mandri square in the eye and said, “You’ll do what I tell you to do.” This was, unquestionably, a threat of violence. Mandri shrank back and raised his hands to surrender. Moteah laughed.
“You got something to say?” Moto asked to his sister.
“Oh come on,” said Moteah. “Look at him. He’s a twig, he can’t carry all that.”
Moto’s jaw went tight. He stood up even straighter. His nose flared as he sniffed that elevated air of authority. He pointed a finger at Moteah and declared, “Then you will carry the Riga.”
Moteah scoffed and settled into an incredulous pose, hand-on-sidethrust-hip, and not to be outskilled in art of finger-wagging, she flicked hers right back at Moto and said, “How about, for once, you take up the weight when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a slapback lizard unfurling it’s frills he rolled back and puffed his chest.
Seb spat a wad of borcandi juice in between the siblings. “I’ll carry it,” he grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop barkin’ and we can get on with it, I’ll carry the damn thing.”
“There’s no room in your pack,” said Moto.
“For Sol’s sake, lash it to my back then.”
Seb unshouldered his pack and dropped it at Moto’s feet. Moto, unhappy with Seb’s act of charity, kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he pulled the limp Riga child up and out of Ayram’s sagging pack. A few wraps and knots of vinecord later, and the dead Riga was fixed into a makeshift harness against Seb’s pack. 
Seb bore his new burden with the stolidity of an ox, and he charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though his springy kick-step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the weight. It was a frightful sight, the Riga child. It was swaddled in black from head to toe, bundled like a block of meat, and as Seb walked the child’s head lolled from side to side.
Elrahet followed after him, and then Purl followed after her, and then Moteah brushed by her brother with a smirk.
Obo hadn’t fit neatly into Mandri’s pack—he’d been squashed down into the side of it, and his arms were folded up and stuck straight up into the air like a rabbit’s ears. When Mandri got the pack settled on his shoulders, the bouncing unset the arms and the elbows went limp and the forearms banged against the back of Mandri’s head.
Moto stopped him from fixing the issue.
“Walk,” he said, and Mandri walked, and they walked like that until they

            <Text>In an earlier answer to a similar question, which u/Ecstatic_Pipe22  linked in his comment, I pointed out that military slaves (along with many other non-military people classified as the slaves of the Ottoman sultan) enjoyed a certain prestige in Ottoman society. Slave status was not necessarily degrading in and of itself. If one was the slave of a powerful person, then the enslaved person could enjoy some prestige from that connection, especially if their function within the powerful person's household brought them into close personal contact with their master. The upper crust of the Ottoman military elite all tried to portray themselves as the sultan's slaves, even if they were actually free, because doing so was a way of emphasizing their closeness to the all-powerful ruler. Prestigious as it was to be a powerful governor, it was even more so to be a governor who could claim to have once personally dressed the sultan in his robes, or held his stirrup, or carried his sword. </Text>

            <Title>Shis</Title>
            <Text>Sheldruub is the Old Jandri word for the final stage of rebirth, characterized by a soothing buzz at the edge of the mind. It is the same word ascribed to the wild slosh of ocean foam that gets beached during a world storm. Such storms can blanket an entire coast six feet deep with salty pale-brown spume. When the storm eventually passes, and the sun shines down, the air becomes saturated with the hiss of an uncountable number of bubbles popping through the course of days. The noise is not loud, it’s simply there and it is everywhere, a sound whose source can’t be placed and so it becomes something like the wind, a force of nature, hardly noticed except for when it disappears, and when it does there comes the sight and memory of solid ground—though the ground is not the same as it once was, for the storm has ravaged it.
 Mandrameen didn’t notice the Sheldruub. He didn’t notice the feeling of his own blood pumping through his veins and tickling his insides. He didn’t notice these things because he was afraid, and he was afraid because his first rekindling thought was that he was dead and that this was the afterlife and that he was a cold corpse floating in a void. The signs were unmistakable. His very bones felt frigid and his whole face was numb—if his face was there at all. There was the unmistakable putrescence of rotting flesh. Mandri knew the smell well because when he was a child, rats frequently died underneath his tiled floor, and he’d have to endure the smell or sleep outside. The first night he slept outside, a spawn of gilt flies got to him. When he woke up, his whole left cheek was covered in hard red welts the size of fingernails, and since the other half of him had been safely nestled in his pillow he looked like he’d been slapped in the face by disease.
The smell of rot was always upsetting, especially now, because, presumably, that smell was coming from him.
And he could not move. Dead things do not move, therefore, he was dead.
Yet, he could breathe. His breath was icy coming out of his throat.
He tried again to move. He wasn’t sure if he had legs or arms at all, for he couldn’t truly feel them—there was only a general chill where his legs and arms should be. As he was coming to terms with the idea that his mind had been decoupled from his flesh and that all these sensations were phantom memories and that his consciousness was floating somewhere inside his decomposing corpse, his eyes opened. They didn’t open far for they’d been glued shut by the crust of death.
He was confronted with a low sandstone ceiling above him, a ceiling stained black with soot. It flickered orange in a meager firelight. It was a natural stone, a familiar texture where the rocky surface was smooth, craggy, and porous all at once—a difficult thing to capture with a brush. And it was a surface unmarred by the clawing rake of chisels, meaning this was no tomb, or mineshaft, or one of those rock-hewn hermit homes that pock the Hias. A cave such as this, Mandri surmised, could only mean that he had been killed, and his body had been borne down to Shis. 
He could not move his neck, but he could swivel his eyes. The cramped walls of this cave bulged out in places and disappeared into pitch-blackness in others.
Surely, this was Shis.
It didn’t quite match his expectations.
Mandri closed his eyes and conjured up an image of the dark earth riddled with pockets of air like this one, each one occupied by a waking corpse like him, each person forced to endure the mire of their own stench for an odd eternity. He found it somehow pleasant, because he wouldn’t be bothered in a place like that. There’d be no obligations. And since he was already dead, he wouldn’t have to eat, and that meant he didn’t have to worry about where his next meal would come from.
He suddenly had full use of his neck. He looked down at his body and saw that he was wrapped tight in a brown woolen blanket, and he lay flat on a bed of straw. He thought it strange for a place such as Shis to provide simple comforts. He looked to his left, to the source of light in the middle of the floor—it wasn’t a tongue of fire piping up from the bowels of the earth, it was, instead, a small flame dancing on a thick flaxen wick which bathed in a shallow clay bowl of tallow. But far from comforting, it was a fright, for its scant orange light licked at a pale and naked creature who lay slumped against the rock on the other side.
This pale creature was humanlike, smaller than Mandri, and it lay on its side, huddled against the cave’s chill. Its odd, stretched anatomy brought a wrinkle to Mandri’s nose, and its skin was smooth and hairless, seemingly burnished to a gloss as if wet, and it was streaked here and there by crusted mud. The ghoul was so skinny that its stringy tendons were almost as strong as its muscles, and its deeply furrowed ribs deepened further with its every breath. Its stomach was grossly distended, and its narrow shoulders were hunched. Mandri supposed the creature was a ‘him’, but he wasn’t sure, for its groin was completely smooth and lacked any sign of gender. But ‘he’ and ‘she’ makes no difference when the subject in question was a demon, for that’s what Mandri supposed. That’s the only possible thing it could be.
Despite this demon’s deformities, its face was smooth and fair, if a little underfed, and its serene expression was couched in generic Hrkan features—thin lips and sad eyes, all in symmetrical and genderless proportions. And it was alive. Its silver eyes were cast down at its chest, studying a grievous wound. Its spider-like finger traced a long line of crude, scabbed-up stitches that ran up the middle of its chest and bent over its heart. Two stitches nearer the middle had burst, leaving a red-lipped slit that exposed a gleaming sternum.
Why a demon had met such abuse, Mandri was not sure. Perhaps this was a human half-transformed, still suffering through its long punishment. A cell-mate of sorts. A vision of what was in store for him.
Mandri had no doubt he would be tortured as well. And after torture, there would come periods of healing, hence the stitching on the demon’s chest. This all made sense because Shis couldn’t be all-torture all-the-time. There would need to be quiet moments to allow for reflection. And no doubt the torture would fit the crimes he’d committed up on the surface. This creature here had committed a crime of passion. Why else would they cut through to its heart? It also explained the erasure of its genitalia. No doubt this was some Hrkan youth who had succumbed to the passions of temptation.
It was such a pitiful sight. Mandri might have been scared of it, but the creature didn’t seem capable of moving. It never even looked at Mandri. Eventually it fell asleep, and when it did, Mandri felt at ease enough to close his eyes and try to predict what style torture was in store.
He thought long and hard about his crimes. He’d never committed any unshoulderable sins, nothing to warrant being impaled on a spike a thousand times or tossed into a lake of fire. People shamed him for giving up on life, but as far as he knew, that wasn’t explicitly forbidden. Who was he harming? No one. Harming himself? Nonsense. He was only trying to find a bit of peace. He found peace by losing himself in burgeons, but if that was wrong then the blame was on whoever had created burgeons, and that was the gods.
He hadn’t killed himself, so there was that. He used to want to kill himself. He once told a Solitant priest his plans, and the man said he’d kill Mandri with the spoon he was holding if Mandri ever said anything like it again. That made as much sense as threatening to throw someone off a cliff after they’ve threatened to jump.
If Solraheen truly wanted to torture some purity back into Mandri’s Spark, then the best way to do it would be to put him right back up there on the surface and surround him with people like that priest. Abusive old folk. Ignorant folk. Plain dumb folk. The vain. Really, everyone in general. Mandri didn’t discriminate when it came to hating people. He himself was a person.
Was self-hatred a crime against the Spark?
If it was, there could be only one punishment with any poetic significance—he would be made to hurt himself. Somehow, this place was going to get him to cut his own throat, or kick his own severed head into a hole. But he wasn’t some penitent pilgrim who took special delight in the cleansing awe of pain, so he’d need some prodding. He might be forced to ingest some mind-controlling substance, or be strapped into an ancient contraption of rust and iron, with knives, chains, and pulleys that could bend his arms against his will and make him flay himself. 
He tried to bend his arms, but he couldn’t. He did have arms wrapped under that brown blanket, for he could sort of feel them now. Then he saw the fingertips of his left hand sticking out from under a blanket fold, and like what happens in a dream, as soon as he saw them, feeling flooded into them. All at once, he had full use of his arm.
He wriggled around to loosen the blanket, and then pulled his left arm free. It was in remarkably good condition for a dead man’s arm. He tossed off the rest of the blanket and sat up, and his joints creaked. He was still wearing that white tunic foisted upon him by the man who’d killed him, though it was much muddier than last he remembered. That, presumably, came from the grave.
He examined the rest of his body piece by piece, and nothing was black and rotting as he’d expected, though he was much dirtier. He made to grab the blanket to cover his legs from the chill, and that’s when he realized his right hand was missing. 
Completely gone.
Missing at the wrist.
In its place was a weedy brown poultice wrapped around the nub of his forearm.
The demons had taken his dominant hand.
His brush-wielding hand.
Of course.
The symbolism was unsophisticated—he’d rejected his great talent and now he’d lost it all together.
But he didn’t feel a thing. Not the slightest twinge of pain.
“Interesting,” he muttered.
He regretted the careless remark immediately, for the sound attracted the attention of the ghoul, whose pale eyes studied him with an uncomfortable curiosity. The creature then pushed itself upright, matching Mandri’s pose, and suddenly it didn’t seem so helpless.
Mandri decided he should look for a way out of this cramped little space.
He stood up, slow and deliberate, half because he didn’t want to make any sudden movements that could be misinterpreted, and half because his muscles simply couldn’t move any faster. He backed up against his side of the cave and his tousled hair brushed against the low ceiling. He felt his way along the sandstone towards the shadows on his right.
The rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. So, Mandri shuffled back the other way, to the left, keeping close to the rock, staying as far away as he could from the pale creature who still watched him with intent. 
Mandri’s searching fingers found a wide crack in the rock behind him. It seemed to be a dark opening that he could shimmy through, but when he stuck his good arm into it, his fingers butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his back exposed in present company, he returned to his brown blanket and straw bed.
There was only one other direction to explore—behind the creature’s right shoulder was a hole in the rock that was wide enough to crawl into. Mandri’s eyes strained to see if it dead-ended.
“There’s no way out that way,” the demon said. Its voice was even and clear, shockingly free of the rankling pain it must be feeling from the wound on its chest. “Or I should say, there is an opening there that leads straight up, but it is not something you can fit through. I’m afraid it’s just another cranny for the lizards.”
“Lizards?” The word flew out of Mandri’s mouth.
“Yes. Lizards,” the demon said. It pointed up with its delicate hand. There on the ceiling, half-buried in sooty cracks, were a dozen or so black blobs. Mandri took them for some strange fungal growth, and then one of them squeaked and scurried along the ceiling towards the unexplored passageway. Its tiny talons scratched the rock as it went. 
The pale demon laughed. It was an inviting laugh, and it had an unmistakable Hrkan lilt. Mandri wondered if this half-boy-half-demon still remembered who it was.
Mandri asked it straight, “What are you?”
“My name is Obo,” said the creature.
Mandri pulled his blanket up tight around his shoulders. “Are you a demon?” he asked.
Obo smiled. His smile was bright even in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs, but wasn’t surprised, for a disarming smile could be as useful for a demon’s purposes.
“Why do you think I’m a demon?”
“You deny it?”
“I do. I am not a demon.”
“Well you look like a demon.”
“How so?”
“Your body is a perversion.”
“Is it!?”
Obo studied his own gangly self in mock surprise. Then he leaned forward slightly and said, eying Mandri’s ruined wrist, “You don’t look so well yourself.”
Mandri drew up his knees and pulled his blanket around them, hiding his whole body underneath. “I feel fine,” he said.
“Who are you, by the way? I’ve given you my name, so it’s only fair if you give me yours.”
“I’m not going to tell you my name,” Mandri said flatly.
“You’re under no obligation, but sharing one’s name is a kindly gesture. I think we could both use a friend, considering our circumstances.”
“And what would you do with my name?”
Obo shrugged. “I would call you by it. What else would I do with it?”
Mandri had heard stories about what demons did with names. Some outland folk kept their true names hidden even from family for fear of what demons could do if they overheard.
“How about this,” Obo said. “Don’t tell me your name, instead, what utterance should I make to grab your attention?”
“I don’t want you grabbing my attention.”
“Why not? Do you feel threatened by me? What am I going to do? Scuttle over there, and then do what? Bleed on you? I’m too weak. I couldn’t break a twig for a fire.” Obo rubbed the raw skin around the wound on his chest to belabor the point.
“Call me what you want,” said Mandri. “There’s only the two of us here, names don’t matter.”
“Only the two of us here? Are you sure about that? You missed the lizards, you might have missed something larger.”
Mandri’s eyes darted to the shadows over Obo’s shoulder, suddenly expecting a fanged and snarling something to jump out. 
Obo smirked and said, “No, not there. There’s a person sitting on the other side of that crack behind you.”
“That crack ends in stone. I checked.”
“It ends in a stone door. You can hear the man snoring, if you don’t believe me.”
Mandri listened carefully, but he heard nothing. Then Obo started mimicking a snoring sound, his arm directing the pitch in and out, directing Mandri’s attention towards its steady rhythm. Then Mandri caught it, the faintest of faint sounds sneaking out of the crack in the wall to his left—someone was surely there, snoring.
“Who is it?”
“Our jailer, I suspect.”
“A demon?”
“Unless a demon’s snore sounds exactly like an underfed Jandri woman who’s chewed too many borcandi spines, then no, not a demon.”
“You can tell all that from the sound of a snore?”
“Borcandi juice gets phlegmy in the throat. It gives it that—you hear it? It gives the snore that sputtering tune.” 
Obo leaned back against the rock. His casual demeanor was at odds with the crude and oozing scar that blotted his chest.
“Is this not Shis?” Mandri asked. “Am I not dead?”
“Do you feel dead?”
“No. But who is to say what being dead feels like? If this is death, then death feels much like living, only colder—so then yes, I do feel dead.”
“You are not dead.”
“I was murdered. I remember dying.” 
“That might be true, but at present you are very much alive. In fact, it was your beating heart that woke me up.”
Mandri tugged his blanket even tighter.
“You can hear my heartbeat?”
“I can hear your eyes blink.”
Mandri instinctively blinked, then he scowled because he felt like he’d been tricked into it. “Only a demon could hear such a thing.”
“I’m not a demon.”
“Well, you’re not a human.”
“That is correct.”
“Then what are you?”
“I am a Mazid.”
Mandri’s heart fluttered at the mention. It actually made a little sense. He remembered seeing a Mazid before, from a distance. It had the same pale white skin, the same slightness of size. But he’d never seen a Mazid naked, and surely the guild of Lords could fleshcraft better than this.
“I don’t believe you,” Mandri finally said.
“Mazidobo is my full name. To friends, it’s simply, Obo.”
“How would a Mazid end up in Shis?”
“We wouldn’t. That’s why you’re not in Shis. As you may know, we Mazidai have only a sliver of a Spark, so we cannot die and be carried to the afterlife.”
“But this feels like Shis.”
“Is it not, at least, conceivable that we are not in Shis, that your dead body was found, brought down to this cave in the Sand’s Pitted Portion, and then, through some unknown means, brought back to life?”
“Who could have done all this?”
“The same people who brought me down here.”
“And who are they?”
“Outlaws. Bandits who haunt the Junei Pass. My Minder and I were tasked with destroying them, but we were overcome. My Minder was slain, I was captured, and then I was brought down here. They are a brood of thieves I imagine. Zealots of a kind. Other than that, I do not know much about them.”
“A Mazid who can hear my eyes blink gets ambushed by a bunch of outland thieves?”
“Yes.”
“That’s not possible.”
“Mere incredulity is not a rational argument.”
“If you’re one of the Mazidai you could prove it—spit Mazidfire.”
“My ability to breathe that fire is contingent upon my Minder’s mood.”
“I thought you said your Minder was killed.”
Obo pointed to the ragged scar that plagued his chest, and said,  “Do you see this?”
“Of course.”
“To control a Mazid, a Minder must cut off their hand, then place it into the Mazid’s chest so that the hand clutches the heart. And as you can see,” he dabbed the stitches with a careful finger, “I have been recently bonded to a new Minder.”
Mandri looked down at his poulticed wrist. Realization dawned, and he imagined his severed hand swimming around some viscous goo inside this creature’s chest. 
“Yes,” said Obo. “Your bloody stump of fingers is fisting my heart.” 
“My hand is inside your chest?”
“You should be able to feel it.”
He couldn’t feel a damn thing.
He didn’t like that they were talking about him, so he turned the tables. “Do something that only a Mazid can do.”
“Aside from spit Mazidfire, the only other thing I can do, that you can’t, is admit when I’m wrong.”
“Horseshit,” Mandri groaned. “I know the Mazidai have other powers.”
“Like what?”
“You can read minds.”
“No, we can’t. We are observant, and that catches some people by surprise and they leap to fanciful conclusions. I cannot read your mind, else I wouldn’t wonder why you think a place like this is worthy of the title, ‘Shis’.”
“What would a Sparkless Mazid know about Shis?”
“So you admit that I’m a Mazid?”
“No, I’m saying that if you were a Mazid, you wouldn’t be wondering about Shis.”
“What would I be doing?”
Mandri had no answer. Not that it mattered. At this point, there was nothing that Obo could say or do that could convince Mandri that he wasn’t stuck in Shis, and he was about to say as much when he was interrupted by the sound of a muffled argument breaking out from behind the wall.
Mandri scooted towards the crack to get a better listen. He couldn’t make out the words. 
“Can you hear them?” he asked Obo.
“Of course.”
“What are they arguing about?”
Obo cocked his ear towards the crack. “Evidently our guard is being harassed because she wasn’t supposed to leave us alone. Her defense is that this little cave of ours smells.”
“She’d be right,” said Mandri, casting an accusing eye at Obo.
“I’m sorry about that,” said Obo. “There’s nothing I can do. But we should probably stop talking.”
“Why?”
“Because I think it’s better for both of us if they think I’ve been asleep this whole time. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t give the ruse away.”
With that, Obo laid back down and assumed the exact position he’d been in when Mandri first saw him. And as soon as Obo closed his eyes, Mandri heard the sound of stone sliding against stone. The heavy block of a door opened, torchlight flooded in, and a short and stout Jandri man bumbled into the cave, hunched over, the flame of his torch licking the ceiling. Behind him came a woman, skinnier, more Hrkan-like, but just as grimy all the same.
When the stout man saw Mandri sitting up, staring at him, he nearly dropped his torch.
“Boy’s awake!” he shouted. “I told you that could happen!”
He slapped the skinny woman in the back of the head.
“Don’t tell Ayram,” she said.
“Oh, I’m telling Ayram.”
“Why? Nothin’s happened! Look at ‘im! He’s barely moved.”
The stout man brought his torch towards Obo, whose act of fitful sleep was quite convincing.
“Fine,” the man said. “I won’t tell. But you’ve got to carry the Mazid.”
“Fine by me,” said the woman. “Barely weighs more than a pinch of tinder.”
She stomped over to where Obo lay and made a fuss about how there wasn’t enough room to maneuver.
Mandri asked the stout man, “Is that really a Mazid?”
The man swung the torch back towards Mandri’s face, stinging Mandri’s nose with its heat.
“You don’t talk,” he said. The torchlight illuminated the man’s untamed face, which was all scarred up, and his wide chin was scraggled up with ugly fuzz. His breath was somehow fouler than the stench of the room.
“Who are you?” Mandri asked.
“Quiet!” the man shouted, and Mandri flinched against the bright specks of spit that flew out from his throat. “You don’t talk!”
The skinny woman was much the same, every bit a weather-beaten poke, with dark robes half-ripped and wrapped tight, and her leathery skin was etched with lines which probably lied about her years. Pokes were always much younger than they actually looked. This one leaned into the light and said to Mandri, “If you flap them lips again, I’ll clip ‘em.”
The stout man chuckled in agreement. “That’s how it is now. You’re with the Ayramun. And best remember—with us, if you break the rules, you get broken. And the rule for you is, you nod or shake your head. That’s all you do, nod or shake. Get it?”
Mandri nodded.
The skinny woman spat a wad of unspeakable phlegm right onto Mandri’s knee. She smiled to herself, then said to Mandri, “What were you doin’ out in that wagon, anyways?”
Mandri did not know how to answer the question by only moving his head. He didn’t think he’d be able to answer it with words, as he had no idea what she was talking about.
She laughed again. “He’s like a rat in a bucket.”
“You will be too if we don’t hurry up,” said the stouter fellow.
“Yeah, yeah.”
The woman pulled Obo’s limp weight up onto her shoulder, and she ferried him out into the darkness. The stout man pulled Mandri up by the collar of his tunic and forced him to follow behind the woman. As Mandri left the cave, he caught a glimmer of Obo’s cheek and he swore he saw the Mazid wink.</Text>

“A moth passes for a leaf, does that make it like a leaf? Or is there something fundamentally different about its nature?”
Mandri hated it when people used metaphors to make a point. Just because one thing roughly maps onto another doesn’t mean that there’s any truth in it. All it does is pull the argument out into murky water where it's drowned in things that don't matter. 


“I simply find it suspect that your  understanding of the structure of the universe centers the human condition. The truth is that while you think the afterlife needs to be a world of woe deep underneath the earth, Solraheen might not have felt the same way.”
“But He did feel that way. He created us from His Spark, so we think and feel like Him.”</Notes>

            <Title>Sight Spot</Title>
            <Text>Finding Elrahet was easy because she never moved far from where she sat down, and that morning Seb had seen her sit down at the ambush sight spot. Getting up to her, however, was difficult. Seb could either climb up the steep cliff face, or he could take the long way, and since he had to carry the bones. He took the long way. He found the Junei road and walked it up into the mouth of the Junei pass, then instead of following that road through the mountains and all the way south to Meskalim, he scrambled off onto a smuggler’s trail which snaked up into the Hias. Before long, he hopped off that trail to follow a path which Ayram had made, one which double-backed towards the east.
It was nearing mid-day when Seb made it to the that wide, mid-cliff ledge where Elrahet was sitting. As far as ambush sight spots go, it was perfect—it offered a privileged view of everything east of the Hias mountains. Below was the mouth of the Junei Pass, out of which the Junei road poured. This unkempt road meandered down into the dark Junei hills, where it was dissected into a filigree of footpaths that wiggled down into the valleys and bent around black screes and outcrops of rock before shooting through the ravines and bowing along the bottoms of the wide, long-dried washes before emptying out, at last, into the Junei plain. Once out on the plain, all roads got lost because the white ground is a rocky caliche that gets swept clean by the strong northerly Junsi wind.
Elrahet was alone up on that high ledge. To Seb’s blurry eyes, she was nothing but a bundle of black rags and long smoky hair flowing out the front of an old crone’s hood. She was sitting cross-legged and looked like she was communing with the vastness of the world, but really, she was sitting, watching, and waiting for their prey to rumble along.
“Took you long enough,” she said as Seb approached.
Seb didn’t wait to catch his breath before saying, “Gugi found some bones and—”
“I know.” 
Seb wondered how she knew, because she hadn’t yet looked at him and what he was carrying. Then he realized that this was, after all, the sight spot, and it had a good angle on just about every ravine, and on top of that, she was a witch. Who knows how far her witchy eyes could see.
“Bring it here,” she said.
Seb knew witches were cantankerous creatures, but Elrahet was especially cantankerous. Seb wondered about her age, though numbered age was rarely a thing people of the Sand kept track of. A sand dune has no age, and outland witches like Elrahet were just as elemental. Her features were as dark, sharp, and solemn as any slab of sand-bitten stone. Her sun-drenched skin was as brown, leathered, and wrinkled as the bark of any pepperwood tree. Her layers and layers of black-rag robe pillowed her knobbly frame and made her look like a ragged, diseased crow. Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the Hias mountains themselves, and probably as old.
“Should I command your every twitch? Put the bag down.”
Seb gently put the bag of bones down, not wanting to annoy her. He didn’t want her to shoo him away before he’d heard what she might say. It was his great mission in life to hear what she had to say. This was a difficult mission, because not only did Elrahet harbor disdain for mankind in general, she hated Seb more than most. And why shouldn’t she? She could see the plan. She knew what he was. And when she did speak, she spoke softly, hoarsely. Her throat croaked like a dying man. All her sentiments were brusque and rude. All her sentences were death sentences. 
Then there was her bloodspeech. That’s what Seb called her absent-minded witchy mumbling. He called it bloodspeech because whenever she spoke it, his own blood tingled, and as soon as the bag was opened and she set to work probing the bones for signs,  she was whispering that cursed bloodspeech.


Elrahet looked up at him through her imperious brown gaze, and her irascible sneer strained the tendons in her neck.
“Busy yourself,” she growled.
Seb stepped back and privately cursed himself for not handling the situation with more tact. He should have expected less. Elrahet was impossible to please. In the first few months of Seb’s journey with the Ayramun, he’d tried winning her over with kindness—he’d make her meals, wash her blankets, carry her things, and for all that she called him a ‘servile oaf’. If he ignored her entirely, that only enraged her. If he did what she wanted, exactly how she wanted it, no more or no less, then he was a ‘mindless poke’. It had been three whole years and as many months, and Seb had learned almost nothing from her.
The only bit of wisdom he’d ever heard her speak was a rather childish aphorism given to Purl. Purl had been pouting about some useless thing and Elrahet said to her, “Every weakness is a strength, and every strength, a weakness.” If anyone else had said something as stupid as that, Seb would have disregarded it. Strength is strength. Weakness is weakness. Seb’s eyes were a weakness. If a thing was up close he could keep it sharp, but ‘way far out’ and ‘not too far off’ were smashed together into a blurry haze he called ‘out there somewhere’. He looked out on the Junei plain from that high ledge, and all he saw was a wash of white ground underneath a blur of blue sky.
The only good thing that came of his unreliable eyes was that he never had to stand watch, and while he took special pleasure in not being saddled with that chore, calling that a strength was merely twisting words. When a man is strong he doesn’t need to twist words. For a witch steeped in the mysteries of the Spark to say a thing like that, to say ‘weakness is a strength’, then there had to be some deeper purpose underneath the surface. Elrahet only ever spoke to bend the world to her will. Her words might have been for Purl, but Seb had overheard it, and him overhearing it was no doubt as much a part of her intentions as if she’d said the words to him directly. She was sending him down a path. Seb was sure of it.
Seb stared out at the Junei plain and tried to find the coming caravan by its aura. He knew the caravan was out there somewhere in that blur, making its way towards the pass to be set upon by the Ayramun. He let his eyes cross just enough so that the white landscape doubled and blurred until the edge between the white chaliche of the plain and the blue of the midday sky softened into a clean gradient. He strained under the effort, until, at last, there was nothing else in the world but him, the cloud of color, and the distant caravan—if it was even there. He supposed it was there, and he hoped to see its aura flare because maybe it takes bad eyes to see the divine light of purpose that shines out of ever living being. Maybe that’s how his weakness was a strength.
He stared into that blur and bore the look of a man possessed—jaw clenched tight, breathing in sips, skin tingling, muscles tense. He could feel the energy screaming out of his eyes, he was scouring all the world with it. He trembled as the gods trembled. Sweat beaded on his brow. 
Then he caught a faint whiff of a curious odor. A foul odor. Was it him? It could be from Elrahet.
He took another sniff and was hit with a familiar musk—it was him.
And there were some nesting brightbeaks, up on the cliff behind. Seb knew this without looking because when brightbeaks jump out of their holes they flap their little wings so hard that it beats a pathetic, warbling whistle out of their tiny chests. One flew right by his ear.
But that brightbeak wasn’t the most distracting thing. That honor went to the way in which the borcandi juice oozed out of the spine tucked in his cheek and welled up in his mouth. Borcandi juice doesn’t play nice with the stomach, so people spit it out. But spitting would break his concentration. Then again, his concentration was already broken, so he spat—he spat out  the whole damn wad. It was as big as his tongue.
“Dammit, Seb! You’re a servant of Shis, I swear it!”
Elrahet’s accusation sent Seb into a flustered panic. He wiped his cheek and prepared to leap to his defense, then was horrified to see a long thin track of green-gray spit lacing across the bag of bones. Thankfully, none of it had touched Elrahet.
“Aw, shit! I’m sorry! Shit. I didn’t mean to.”
He crouched down and tried to atone for his stupidity by wiping the bag clean with his dirty sleeve.
Elrahet glowered and said, “Get away afore I have you tossed off the cliff!”
“I didn’t mean it, I’m sorry.”
Elrahet picked up her short, gnarled root of a walking cane and swung it at Seb’s head. He pulled back in time to watch it brush his nose.
She said, “I’m that close to cursing your flesh so it steams your bones.”
“I didn’t mean it. Here, let me—”
She swung again, and her back swing was faster, so fast that her cane head smacked his cheek. If she’d been serious, it might have broken his face.
Seb clutched his bruised cheek and backed away, thankful it was only a warning, though Elrahet’s withering glare said her patience would not bear another word. 
Seb cursed himself again as he walked away. This was another weakness of his—he was forgetful. He couldn’t hold onto a moment if he were alone in a pitch-black cave. People said this was because of all the spines he chewed, but Seb knew that wasn’t true because he’d always been like this. And he’d never once been in a position where his fitful mind was a strength. Gugi had said that if his mind was always jumping around then at least that means he can’t be sad for too long, and so he should be happy about that, but somehow that wasn’t true—being sad was the one thing Seb could be for too long.
He leaned over the cliff face and spat a loogie down. He watched it fall with some delight, though he was denied the pleasure of seeing it splat on the rocks below because the ground was far enough away to be ‘out there somewhere’.
That’s when Moto came scrambling down to the sight spot from some hidden perch up above.
Seb disliked Moto. Moto, a black man from Zos, was stronger, younger, and more skilled than Seb in every way imaginable. He was too well put together to be an Ayramun. Everyone else made do with dark, patchwork robes and nail-strapped soles for shoes, whereas Moto had thin silver metal buckles on his dusty black boots, and he wore an orange robe that was tucked and folded into sharp knife pleats that slanted across his chest and were kept secured by a wide and tight black sash around the belly. Moto was so clean and fastidious that he would have been at home in the upper rete of Hrkan society. He even had a sword, a long, curved sword set inside a gold-studded scabbard—it even had a name. Worse than all this, he had healthy teeth. Few things made Seb more aware of his own disgusting self than being in the presence of healthy teeth. A man is hard done up when a smile does nothing but make him jealous.
Moto surveyed the Junei plain and said to Seb, “You can’t see them, can you?”
The bastard knew he couldn’t see shit. That’s who Moto was—there was a bag of dead bones not ten feet away, an ill omen just discovered, yet here Moto was taking the time to take the spit right out of Seb’s cheek.
“I can’t see shit,” said Seb.
Moto chuckled. His was a damned hearty, healthy chuckle. “Well they’re there,” he said. “They’re on their way. Exciting, isn’t it?” He then looked down at Elrahet, pretending to notice the bones for the first time. “And who is that?”
Loath to be interrupted, Elrahet grumbled out a barely-audible answer. “Nothing.”
“Nothing? What does that mean?”
“Means what it means.”
“Come one, I need to know. The Mazid will be here before long. Does it change things?”
Elrahet stood up, grabbed the bag, hauled it over to the edge of the cliff, and emptied it out. The bones came tumbling out, cracking against the cliff face below, and and long with it came a smattering of sand that the wind blew right in Seb’s face.
She tuned and glared at the two men, and she was remarkably calm considering the circumstances. Her skin was so lined with age that even the subtlest action of her brow would send it cracking into sharp relief. At the moment there was only the faintest hint of that familiar sneer. She was watching, though, watching like she already knew what each of them was want to do.
Then she huffed and shuffled down the ridge path, and followed up it further up into the hills towards her witchy cave.
“I guess that means they don’t matter,” Moto mused, lips tight. “I guess that means it’s on.”
“You sure they’re out there?” Seb asked.
Moto nodded and pointed out into the blur. “There’s a tiny black speck and a faint cloud of dust. That would be them. That would be our target.”
“You sure that’s them?”
“Who else could it be?”
“Could be anyone.”
Moto snorted in annoyance, which was a common enough occurrence that some of the Ayramun called him a ‘rutting bull’, though they were careful to never let Moto overhear.
Moto said, “Elrahet predicted that a Mazid and his Minder were making for the pass and the two would be hiding themselves in a blackwood caravan. She said they’d be coming mid-day today.” Moto pointed out to the desert again, this time with two imploring hands. “There’s a caravan out there. It’s mid-day. It all fits. That’s who we’re hunting. Or do you doubt Elrahet?”
Seb spat another loogie off the cliff and asked, “Did Elrahet say anythin’ about a dead body?”
“No,” Moto said defensively. “Are you saying something about a dead body?”
“I’m not sayin’ nothin’, I’m lookin’ at it scattered over these cliffs.”
“I don’t see is why it changes anything.”
“If there’s a curse floatin’ in them hills, then Ayram should know about it.”
“Who said anything about a curse?”
Seb simply grunted and said, “Unexpected bones are foul omens.”
Moto snorted again. “Everything is a foul omen to you. A rock stuck in your shoe is a foul omen. A dead leaf is foul omen. Unless Elrahet thinks there’s something more here, then it doesn’t change anything.”
“How’s it not change nothin’? How’s findin’ a dead body not put a notch in your noggin?”
“Because I’m a man of resolve, Seb. I go until the goings no good.”
“You don’t even know for sure there’s a Mazid out there in that desert. Could be only merchants and we come out here for nothin’.”
“If it’s only merchants, then we knock off a few fat bellies and we get a little richer. What’s the problem?”
“Could be that those aren’t merchants, but a bunch of Hrkan Skulsi in disguise.”
“If it’s Skulsi, all the better. We’d be killing people worth killing.”
“Could be a Mazid and no Minder, what then? Need both, don’t we? What if it's only one and not the other?”
“Hrks wouldn’t move a Mazid this far out without its Minder. They don’t trust the Mazidai.”
“What if it's a Mazid and a Minder and some Skulsi. What then?”
“A few soldiers won’t change the balance.”
“What if it’s more'n a few?”
“Then we’ll kill more than a few.”
“And how much is that?”
Moto rolled his eyes and pulled a small, red leather purse from out of his robe. Seb’s eyes went wide at sight of it, for inside that pouch was a ribbon of black silk, and folded inside that silk were two smooth rock crystal lenses set inside thick brass rings. These rings were joined together by a dangling chain that when stretched was the length of Seb’s forearm. Seb always itched to try out those lenses, but Moto never let him touch them. Seb hated Moto for that. If those two lenses, set in array, could magnify the distance and make the horizon seeable, well, Seb wanted to have a look.
Moto sat down on the edge of the cliff and propped his elbow up on one knee and let his other leg dangle free. He hunched over, put the smaller lens up to his eye, then stretched out the other lens as far the chain would let, and began his squinting study of the distant blur.
Seb didn’t like that Moto was sitting that way. It wasn’t just the lenses, it was the casual disregard for what Seb was capable of doing. In a flash, Seb could be right behind him and push him off the cliff. Seb could end him right there. For all of Moto’s skill and style, Seb could end him here. There were plenty of moments like this when Seb could do it. Could do it while Moto slept. While he ate. Seb had half a mind to do it right now.
“I count fifty-four of them. Give or take.”
“Fifty-four’s more’n most,” said Seb.
“And fifty-four is exactly how many Elrahet said there’d be—though there is an odd fix about them.”
“An odd fix?”
Moto squinted again. He was evidently having trouble keeping his quarry in focus.
“It’s like they’re…well…they’re a standard caravan guard alright, but it looks like they’re marching in squares.”
Seb didn’t know much, but he knew one thing for certain—Moto’s expectations were getting in the way of the truth. And there was one other thing he knew for certain. “There ain’t no caravan guard that keeps a column,” he said.
“That’s why I say it’s an odd fix.”
“It’s an odd fix ‘cause they ain’t no caravan guard. Elrahet was wrong.”
“Eight wagons,” Moto added. “Exactly matches her premonitions.” 
Seb screwed up his face in thought. Eight wagons was several more than the average merchant train. Predicted, maybe. But a merchant guard marching in tight formation? Caravan hands in this part of the Sand were ragged bands of backwash from Hrkan conquests, not the kind to march in squares.
These were Skulsi, Seb was sure. Fifty-four Skulsi and a god-damned Mazid were bearing down on them. And how many more men might be hiding in those wagons? Thirty?
Seb compared all this to what the Ayramun brought to bear—forty-three bows. Forty-three bows and Ayram. And old Elrahet. Against anyone else he liked the odds, but nobody tangled with one of those Mazidai with good reason—those slave-gods could wipe out entire armies.
The Ayramun’s only hope was the element of surprise. The Junei hills were a decent place to bushwhack a column of Hrks. Everywhere the slopes were steep, and no matter which particular route was taken into the pass there were places where strong shoulders would have a clean shot at the whole enemy column—that’s assuming the whole column was dumb and tried to stuff through all at once, but Skulsi weren’t dumb. Against fearful men, an ambush here would be a slaughter. Against experienced warriors, Seb was not so sure. Add a Mazid…if the Mazid was ready...maybe the odds were three to one against. And that’s assuming the Mazid got taken down without too much trouble. 
Moto said, “I’d take them for Skulsi, but even from here you can see they’re wearing the stingy brown wool of blackwood guards.”
“Could be they been drilling common hands,” said Seb.
“That could be.”
“Could be those really are Hrkan troops.”
“But they’re wrapped in brown wool,” said Moto.
“So? A man can change his clothes.”
Moto shook his head. “A Skulsi doesn’t drop his whites for convenience, not even for subterfuge. It’d be a black mark.”
“The Sand makes converts of us all.”
Moto let go of his outstretched lens and watched it dangle on its chain. “Pride,” Moto noted through a plaintive sigh, “Is the only thing a Skulsi has. Once a soldier earns the whites, he’s not going to take them off.” He then acceded a shrug and added, “Still, even if they’re wearing brown, they could be fighting men.”
Seb said, “They could be rabble, and they could be Skulsi.” 
“Skulsi won’t run when the killing starts.”
Seb nodded, and added, “And the way we’re set up—”
“I know,” said Moto. “This only works if they try to run. But this is a game of risk. This is a Mazid we’re dealing with. The Skulsi hardly matter.” 
“Then it’s decided,” Seb said. “It’s off.”
“It’s not for you to call, Seb. Sol’s light knows you’d be the last person allowed to make that call.”
“You ain’t shit either.”
“That’s where you’re wrong. Ayram put me in charge.” He stood back up to make sure Seb got the full measure of him. “And like it or not, this is the only opportunity we’ll have to catch us a Mazid and his Minder, and Elrahet being wrong about who they’re marching with isn’t enough to call this off.”
“What about the bones?”
“What about them?”
“If this don’t work out, an’ Ayram finds out there’s a dead body that you didn’t let him know about, then I’m blamin’ you. It’ll be your fault—your fault.”
“Yes, that’s how responsibility works.”
Moto then pinched a flat stone finger whistle between his lips and whistled the song of the Jek Tresset to let the Ayramun hidden in the valleys below know that the ambush was on. He stabbed and fluttered the high notes to encourage haste. Twittered replies sprang up from the hills below, and then, without so much as a parting nod, he set off down the path that led into that maze of mounded clay and rock.
Seb had different ideas about what he needed to do. He was going to run off to Elrahet’s cave, for she was soon to conjure a blanket of fog the likes of which the Junei hills hadn’t seen for an age—a nice impenetrable fog to lay cover for the ambush. Damn it all if Seb watch how she did it.
Elrahet, he’d learned, was difficult on account of her witchy senses. He’d waited long enough, and he knew where it was because the night before he’d scouted for it—it a thin crack in the base of a giant sloping slab of granite that constituted the greater part of a mountain peak. It was a bit of a climb to get to it. How Elrahet managed it, Seb had no idea.
When he made it to the cave crack, he could hear Elrahet’s faint bloodspeech mumblings echoing out. He shuffled inside and saw old Elrahet squatting over the corpse of a sizable black-backed lizard, both of them illuminated by a shaft of light pouring down from a hole in the ceiling.
The lizard was belly up, and Elrahet’s fingers were already knuckle deep in its guts. Her arm twisted and twirled, and her lips whispered incantations as her upturned eyes searched the blue sliver of midday sky that peeked through the crack in the rock above.
Then she turned and set her old blue eyes on Seb.
He stumbled backwards in fright and bumped his head on a rock and howled in pain.
“Damn!”
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, then she set her eyes back on the sky, and put her hand to work again in the lizard’s corpse.
She lowered her voice to a whisper
Seb strained to hear her garbled words.
“Em bestet buguul.”
When the words were echoed and gone, she looked down at her handiwork and said, “Em bestet shemuul.” 
She pushed down hard with her palm to squeeze the last meal out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Shefre gor, amkukre dor.” 
Her knotted fingers kneaded the intestines. 
“Shefre gor, zomgagor.”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up into the air and croaked, “We would be dust without it!” 
She dropped the entrails back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within.
Seb waited with bated breath for a sight of a Spark, or some effervescent swirl of glowing smoke, or anything, but nothing happened.
Elrahet snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s white belly wider. Into this gaping hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, and then pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin. The lizard’s belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Its gummy tongue popped out of its shovel mouth. Right when Seb supposed that the thing had come back to life, it went limp again.
Elrahet pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh.
“It is possible,” she said in a whisper loud enough for Seb to hear, “that the beast is infertile.”
Seb ventured nearer. It seemed she was talking to him. There was no one else.
“This won’t work?” he asked as he knelt across from her.
“Not with this beast.”
Seb poked the lizard’s corpse with a curious finger. He could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-gray intestines inside seemed to writhe and pulse like a twisted mass of worms.
“What are you gonna do?” he asked.
Elrahet hissed at his impudence, then said, “I need a fertile stomach.”
She looked at Seb’s stomach.
“Fresh blood from a fertile stomach,” she said.
Seb’s skin went cold at the insinuation.
She said. “You are right here, in my cave, during my time of need. Did Solraheen provide you to me without my seeking?”
“My blood’s no good.”
“Quit your bellyaching and give me your arm.”
“My arm?”
“Your arm.”
“Thought you were gonna cut out my stomach. How much blood do you need?”
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given, least of all for magic. There’s no telling what a witch might do with it. But this was a golden chance to get in with the old woman and he had to take it. He studied her countenance to gauge her sincerity. Even in direct light, the difference between Elrahet’s smile and her frown was almost imperceptible under her sneer. It was common belief amongst the Ayramun that Elrahet never smiled at all, but Seb knew that wasn’t true. He’d seen her smile. He knew what it looked like. She wasn’t smiling now. 
“Your arm,” she said.
Seb rolled up his sleeve and extended his arm. Elrahet grabbed his wrist and Seb nearly wretched because her fingers were still dripping with the lizard’s blood. He also didn’t care for the way she seemed to relish the sight of his veins bulging under his brown skin.
Seb thought his blood was potent. He thought she’d only need a prick. She was only going for a fog after all, not a mountain storm. In truth he didn’t have the slightest idea how this all worked, but if it took more than prick of human blood for a fog, then what would it take for a mountain storm?
He shuddered at the thought. Elrahet felt this shudder in her fingers. She smiled. It caught Seb off-guard for it was more than a crick in the corner of the lip, it was a full-on, nearly toothless grin.
Seb asked again, this time with more than a hint of unease, “How much do you need?” 
Elrahet’s smile faded and that mess of aged lines settled back into her familiar sneer. She pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from out of the shadows beside her and laid them between herself and Seb. Then she unsheathed a curved, thin golden knife from her belt and held it’s curve length-wise along Seb’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said, without affection.
“Same.” 
Elrahet savored the returned courtesy, then pricked her dagger’s tip into his flesh and flicked her wrist with expert care to open the vein. Seb remained stoic through the sting but he watched with grave concern as blood streamed out of the wound and ran around his wrist and over Elrahet’s knuckles as it flowed steadily down into the bowl.
After what seemed an eternity, he jerked his arm free. 
“That’s it,” he said firmly, and he held his hand up and pinched the wound closed with his thumb.
“Your gift is humbling,” said Elrahet, “But the bowl is half-full.”
“That should be enough.”
“Is it?”
“A poor witch blames her tools.”
Elrahet scowled. “Who told you that?”
“You’re not the only witch I’ve known.”
Elrahet grumbled as if she were about to bark and bite. 
Seb backed away.
When next she spoke her voice was thick with contempt. 
“Think worse of where you sit on the scales of my mercy. I could have your stomach for a bag.”
She tossed the scrap of linen at Seb’s face and shooed him out with a flick of her finger.
Seb cursed himself yet again, because not only did he spoil whatever goodwill he thought he’d earned, but he’d let her prick his right wrist, his pulling wrist. Every pull of the bowstring in the coming ambush would bring a twinge of pain. </Text>

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile…), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. Settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an ePub or Kindle ebook.
How To Use This Template
Inside the “Manuscript” folder, create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
⁠Note: The “Manuscript” folder is what we refer to in the documentation as the “Draft folder”. It’s just been renamed “Manuscript” in this template.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format and with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided which can be used for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder.
You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely).
To create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.
Alternatively, you can just click “Add”, or hit Ctrl+N, with the Characters or Places folders selected.
You can view character and setting sketches in the Inspector as follows:
Select the “Bookmarks” pane in the Inspector.
If necessary, click on “Document Bookmarks” at the top and switch to “Project Bookmarks”.
Click on the dropdown arrow next to the “Characters” or “Places” folders in the Bookmarks list and choose the sheet you wish to view.
A “Notes” folder has been provided for project-level notes. This has been set as the default Bookmarks folder in Project &gt; Project Settings…, so that when you create a new document from the Bookmarks sidebar in a Quick Reference panel, the document will be added to this folder.
Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Notes” folders). Different front matter is used for different formats.

Tip: You can open this document in a Quick Reference window and have it open alongside the compile dialog if you need to refer to these instructions while compiling.
To compile to standard manuscript format
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information (by default it will use the Author Information supplied in File &gt; Options…).
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “Print”, “PDF” or one of the rich text file formats such as RTF, Word or OpenOffice.
Select either “Manuscript (Courier)” or “Manuscript (Times)” from the list of formats on the left (note that this list changes depending on the file format you have chosen).
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Manuscript Format” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to paperback PDF format
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Next to “Compile for”, select “PDF”.
Select “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” from the list of formats on the left.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Paperback” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. (This has already been set up for you.)
Click on “Compile”.
To compile to ebook format
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image.
You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “Ebook” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Be sure to check online for recommended image sizes and file format, because the recommendations are constantly changing. The sample cover image provided is 2,500 x 1,563 pixels.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
From the “Compile for” menu, select one of the ebook formats.
To create an ePub file, choose either of the “ePub Ebook” formats.
To create a Kindle file, choose the “Kindle Ebook” format.
Select “Ebook” from the list of formats on the left.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked under the contents list on the right and that the “Ebook” folder is selected in the pop-up button next to it. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (Un-ticking this does not affect the cover image.)
Above the contents list in the rightmost header bar are six buttons. Click on each of them in turn to go through the various available settings, changing what you need. In particular:
Fill in the metadata such as author name and book title.
Ensure your cover image is selected and shown.
Click on “Compile”.
Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be edited in the metadata pane of Compile (click the tag icon in the rightmost header bar of the Compile panel).
Chapter subtitles: By default, Compile for this template is set up so that chapter numbers are added but not chapter titles. If you want to include the title of the chapter folder in Compile:
Click on “Assign Section Layouts” at the bottom of the Compile panel.
Select “Chapter Heading” in the list on the left.
Select a different layout on the right, such as “Chapter Title”. (These layouts determine how each part of your manuscript looks in the compiled text.)
Font: You can override the font used throughout a compiled document. At the top of the “Section Layouts” pane in the centre of the Compile panel, change the “Font” setting.Note that fonts are not included in ebooks, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a font in an ebook). The “Font” setting is therefore not available for ebook formats.
Page size: The “Paperback” formats are set to create a PDF with a page size of 5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot; or 6&quot; x 9&quot;, which are two of the formats you can use with Amazon’s CreateSpace and are popular sizes for trade paperbacks. You can create your own paperback format using a different page size as follows:
Right-click on the “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format in Compile’s “Formats” list.
Select “Duplicate &amp; Edit Format…”. The compile format designer window will open.
In the “Format Name” text field at the top, change the name to something meaningful (e.g. “Paperback (5.5&quot; x 8.5&quot;)”) and select “My Formats” as the “Save To” location.
Select “Page Settings” in the sidebar.
Click on the “Page Setup…” button.
In the “Page Setup” panel that appears, ensure “Custom” is selected in the “Paper Size” menu and click the “…” button.
Enter a new paper width and height. (Do not worry about setting the margins here; if you want to change these for the compile format, do so after the next step by clicking the “Margins” button just below “Page Setup…”.)
Click “OK” and then click “OK” again.
Click “Save” in the Compile panel. This will return you to the main Compile preview. You now have a variation of the paperback format using a different page size that you can use at any time with any project.
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way; you can create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (e.g. add text, change the title or icon, set default metadata and so on). Now this document will be available as the basis for creating new documents from the New From Template menu.
To make it so that adding a new document to the folder created in (1) always results in a document based on the template set up in (2), select the folder and go to Documents &gt; Default Template for Subdocuments, then choose the template document you created.
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
Go to Project &gt; Project Settings… and select “Section Types”.
Select the “Default Types by Structure” tab.
Delete “Level 1 files” and “Level 2 files and deeper”.
In the “Section Type” column, change the setting for “All files” to “Chapter”, then hit “OK”. This tells Scrivener that all your files contain chapter text, not scenes. Compile has already been set up to apply the right formatting to the section types defined here.
Using a custom table of contents in ebooks: When exporting to ebook format, Scrivener automatically generates a table of contents. If you would like to customise what appears in the contents, follow these instructions:
Create a document for your table of contents inside the Front Matter/Ebook folder.
Name the document “Contents”.
With the “Contents” document open in the editor, select Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place. The editor header will turn pink to indicate the lock, and you will be able to work in the binder without affecting the editor.
In the binder, select the documents you would like to appear in the table of contents (hold down Ctrl to select more than one document).
For a simple flat list, drag the selected documents into the editor and drop them in the empty “Contents” document. Alternatively, if you would like the table of contents indented to match the binder structure, select Edit &gt; Copy Special &gt; Copy Documents as Structured Link List and then click into the text of the “Contents” document and hit Ctrl+V or use Edit &gt; Paste. The documents you wish to appear in the table of contents will now appear as a list of links.
If you wish to centre the table of contents, select the text and centre it.
In the Inspector, change the “Section Type” of the “Contents” document to “Table of Contents”.
Remove the editor lock by toggling Navigate &gt; Editor &gt; Lock in Place or deselecting the option from the menu that appears when right-clicking the document icon in the editor header.Now, when you compile, your custom “Contents” document will be used instead of the automatically-generated one. The titles in the links of the “Contents” document will automatically be updated to match those of the final compiled ebook.
Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Manuscript (Courier)”, and “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback (5.06&quot; x 7.81&quot;)” format with chapter subtitles included, as described in Making Changes, above.
Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template to suit how you work.

Like all templates in Scrivener, this project was originally created from the “Blank” template. We’ve simply added a few folders and set everything up in ways that should be useful to novel writers. Everything you can do with this project, you could equally do by creating a “Blank” project and setting it up yourself.

You can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template…</Text>

            <Title>The Tib</Title>
            <Text>They came at last to a moundless plain covered in a sticky bush called, unsurprisingly, stick bush. This plain led to the Tib desert, also called the Black Road, and the Tib was one of the Sand’s Eight Portions all unto itself. It was a flat, empty, expanse with a hard floor of small stones tarred in black rock-varnish. These stones were inset into the earth, as tightly interlocked as any Hrkan mosaic.  
Before they crossed into the Tib, Ayram had them all pick as many stick bushes as they could carry. Mandri was told it was for wood to make fire. Everyone picked ridiculous amounts and tied them onto their packs. Obo was practically buried in them. They looked like a family of giant hedgehogs. No one joked about it, as the mood was getting bleak because everyone, even Ayram, was tiring. Mandri felt remarkably lively. He tried to hide the fact that he’d found his desert legs, lest someone decide they wanted to unload some of their burdens onto him.
The first hand of the Tib was wonderful, for the flat and solid ground was a welcome change. Every hand after was a terror. The afternoon sun was killing them. The rocks underfoot were hot enough to blister bare skin, even if all a toe did was slip onto them for a moment, and after a day of walking,  they had to check their shoe-soles for budding holes that needed to be repaired because the ground could burn right through it.
More than any other part of the desert, the Tib was endless. They walked it, heading south and east, and after two days nothing changed. It was always the same endless black plain and empty sky. 
They tried to sleep two hands every night because they were simply too exhausted to walk right through it. And they had to sleep huddled around twiggy fires made from their stick bushes. It wasn’t the heat that provided comfort, though the nights were cold, it was the smell, for suspended above these miniature fires were tin bowls filled with a scented wax, smelling of carrion. In the mornings, the hardened wax would be thick with the fuzzy brown bodies of cusiloe flies, who’d been looking for meat in which to implant their eggs.
The flies live just under the Tib's skin, squeezed deep into the crevices of the interlocking rocks, and the odors of flesh, living or otherwise, drew them from hibernation—but only at night. Like reasonable creatures, they wouldn’t come out to bake in the sun. As soon as the red lip of the sun peeks up in the east, everyone rose and checked themselves to make sure they hadn’t been impregnated. If a fly did get under the skin, and the eggs were allowed to hatch, removing them would be a painful ordeal. Seb described the larvae—pulsing white thumbs with two fangs the length of fingernails. Pull them out and they can rip the flesh and leave a hole that will get infected. You look for them by feeling. Skin is too dark to see these soft little welts, especially Moto and Moteah's skin, so they had to feel around for a hardened, coin-sized bump, like a callous on the palm, but maybe it’s on the thigh, on the prick, in your armpit, upon your back, and since no one can reach the back, they’ve got to have someone else do it.
Moteah and Moto checked each other. Ayram and Elrahet checked each other. Mandri smiled at Purl but this was not reciprocated. He was paired with Seb. Neither were happy about the arrangement. Mandri complained about Seb’s borcandi stained fingers. Seb was worried, perhaps rightly so, that Mandri might miss a spot. 
Nobody checked Obo. He said the flies wouldn’t bother him. If they did, he would know.
Before setting off, they’d scrape the paste of dead flies from the surface of the wax and save them for food. Then they’d be on their way again, a short sprint in the half-light hours before the sun became unbearable, and when that happened, they’d stop, pitch little shelters, and rest until the worst of the heat had passed.
It was a lurching way to travel, and it felt to Mandri that they made no progress. Two more days passed and still the scenery did not change. To the north, a flat plain of pebbles for as far as the eye could see. To the south, a flat plain of pebbles for as far as the eye could see. To the east and to the west it was the same—flat for as far as the eye could see. For all he knew they were going in a circle. He began to study the chaotic patterns in the cracks on the floor. Once or twice he saw a jagged triangle that he’d swore he saw the day before.
Moving like this, out of rhythm and in unfamiliar hours, skating on the surface of an endless black stone sea, it changed the perception of time. There were no new spikes of memory around which a moment could congeal. No new sounds, and no new conversations because the heat of the day and the cold of night tempered everyone into the same person— short responses, shrugging shoulders, faces set in the same tight-lipped frown that said, “I just want to get through it”. And that’s who everyone was, bundled, muddled balls of just-get-through-it.
Except for Obo, of course. Obo remained genial and solicitous. Everyone hated him.</Text>

            <Title>Exit</Title>
            <Text>It was the middle of night when they reached the end of the Tib. Mandri was so happy that he collapsed in prayer. Everyone was ecstatic—everyone but Ayram. His fretful eye studied the north.
“Looking for Hrks,” he said.
They might have made it out of the Tib, but they hadn’t made it out of danger. But their mood was good, and doubly so, because the eastern rim of the world was peaked with the red Goree mountains. Those mountains had arrived all at once, a long, dark lumpy line.
The Ayramun picked themselves up and quickened their pace, practically jogging along, for the Goree had no hills. The way to them was flat and iron-red, and it stayed that way all the way up to the mountain chain’s base. The mountains themselves were brilliant red buttresses against the desert wind, and as such their rock faces bore the scars of the wind’s assault—deep, erosive cuts swept up and over them.
Ayram led them south in line with these mountains, towards the Goree Pass.
Mandri asked Moteah how Ayram knew where they were relative to the Pass.
“He remembers it,” said Moteah, as if that were a perfectly adequate explanation. Mandri knew that Ayram couldn’t have dead-reckoned it all the way from that little desert temple. The featureless Tib would have made that impossible, and the arc of the sun was more of a guideline than a precise measure.
He considered asking the giant himself, but decided not to, and good thing too, because the next person who spoke drew Ayram’s ire.
It was Seb.
She had to poop.
Ayram shushed her, but Seb insisted.
“You’re the one that made me eat those flies!” Seb said.
“Alright!” Ayram exclaimed, and he stopped walking. “We’ll make a short camp here. Be quick and quiet.”
“It ain’t gonna be quiet, I can tell ya that. Ain’t gonna be quick, either.”
Seb sauntered off towards the mountains, and disappeared amongst the shadows of rocks.
Mandri dumped Obo onto the ground, then went to Moteah and asked for some twigs to make a fire to calm the night chill.
“No fires,” said Ayram. “We’ve got to be quiet, and we’ve got to pass unseen.”
Moto added. “If you don’t know, the Goree’s cursed. If that doesn’t get you, there’s two kinds of tribes in the Goree—those who want to kill you, and those who want to steal all your stuff. Either way, you end up dead.”
“Won’t they have seen us coming from miles away?”
“There’s not much reason for them to be watching the Tib, because it’s not a journey often made. We might have slipped through and if we have, we don’t want to spoil it with a fire.”
“Well, how close are we to the Pass?”
“We’ll be upon it by morning,” said Ayram.
“In the light of day?”
“Yes.”
“But you just said that everyone wants to kill us.”
“The Goree pass is protected by outland law, so long as you pass in the day.”
“And who enforces that law?” Obo asked.
“Custom.”
Obo laughed, and this drew a dirty look from Moto. Moto said,  “Custom may mean nothing to you, but desert custom demands respect amongst outland tribes. They preserved our peoples for thousands of years despite every attempt to eradicate us. Every tribesman knows that if they violate the truce of the Goree Pass, then they are dead.”
Obo said, with ebullient eyes, “I didn’t laugh because I doubted you. I laughed because I believed you.”
“Well, I don’t believe him,” said Mandri.
“But you should,” said Obo.
“Why? No desert custom is going to stop people from looking out for themselves.”
“Have you ever heard of the Tukli?” Obo asked.
“The who?”
“The Tukli lived in an alluvial plain just south of Cask. They had strange ways of worshiping Solraheen, so to incorporate them into the Hrkan world the Lords had to reform their religion. The plan was to do it piecemeal, over generations, so as not to cause a stir—don’t start with the religion itself, start with some of their customs to soften them up. The first thing we did is we told them to write Solraheen with one ‘h’ instead of two.”
“So?”
“Guess what they did.”
“They didn’t want to do it?”
“They built warehouses out of resin-rich timber, locked themselves inside, and then burnt it all down. An entire tribe of ten-thousand people killed themselves in one night. They killed themselves and their children over a single L. If you ever make it to Jeket’s library, you should look for a book on the histories of the Old Believers.”
“I’m not going to do that.”
“You should. The customs of Outland tribes are tickling.”
Elrahet had been sitting silently by herself, brooding as she’d been want to do since they’d entered the Tib. The next words she spoke were her first in several days. “You’re the Mazid that killed the Tukli?”
“Are you not listening?” said Obo. “They killed themselves.”
Elrahet turned her back and that was that.
Ayram said that was enough noise for the night, and they took up shelter behind a jumble of boulders which blocked the western wind. Ayram shared stern words with Seb when she got back from her fecal excursion. All save the giant lay down to rest.</Text>

            <Title>Deep Well</Title>
            <Text>The next morning they stumbled upon a deep well in the middle of nowhere. None present had ever seen it before, though Elrahet claimed to have seen it, only she had no memory of it.
Nobody challenged this incongruity.
But the well was huge, two-men wide, and included a full set of stairs zig-zagging down to the bottom, some fifty yards deep. There was a bucket, and Moto lowered it. The water he pulled up was salty and brackish, and there were fish in it. They were the ugliest little minnows that Mandri had ever seen—blind pink fish with pulpy membranes where there should have been eyes.
Moto gathered them up and cooked the lot of them in a stew.
It was not delicious.
Afterwards, Seb began an argument with her own damned self. She said, between squelching chews of borcandi spine, “If you take a barrel full o’ water and put a livin’ fish in it, the water overflows, but if you put a dead fish in it, the water don’t overflow.”
She claimed this implied something or other about the Spark, but then she immediately discounted it, and she went on like this for half a hand until Obo asked the woman if she’d ever actually put a dead fish into a barrel of water. Seb said she hadn’t, so she filled a bowl with water, put a dead fish in it, and found that water overflowed.
She did not know what to make of this.</Text>

            <Text>Under his feet were holes burrowed by some strange species of yellow-headed lizard. At night those lizards escaped from their haunts and searched for food. He could see them silhouetted against the starry sky. Their mounds were covered with picked cleaned bones of all manner of mouse, lizard, ground-nesting birds, and berrybush stems.
He wondered if these lizard mounds had once been cities. There were lizard mounds lining to the horizon, and beyond that to the ends of the world.
A distant lizard sent forth a screaming hiss into the night. Other lizards from other lizard cities immediately took up his challenge, and for a good few hands the peace of the starry sky was upset by the hissing, hacking, crying foul of yellow headed brats. </Text>

            <Title>Mandrameen</Title>
            <Text>A Solitant priest hears the word ‘white’ and he thinks of the pure white glow of the god Solraheen—a white so bright it bursts out of itself and splits softly into rays of red, green, and blue. A Hrkan man hears the word ‘white’ and he pictures the plain and stainless robes of Hrkan Lordship. An outland man hears ‘white’ and he thinks of sparkling salt pans, clouds, and sun-bleached bone. As it is with ‘white’, so it is with words, they mean different things to different people. So it is some wonder that Solraheen would choose the medium of the word to create the world. He was there in the void, spoke one word, the world emerged, and people haven’t stopped arguing about the meaning of it all ever since.
‘Art’ is a particularly contentious word. Solitants say the word had a fixed meaning, back when artists were truly spiritual beings. But that was long ago, and in the ages since, the meaning of ‘art’ and ‘artist’ became confused, so much so that the heresy of ‘art’ as a means of personal expression pollutes the minds of many.
A Solitant sermon on ‘Art as Exegetical Instrument’ begins with the following questions:
What is art?
Who is an artist?
Who isn’t?
A painter, a sculptor, these are artists, yes, that’s reasonable to say, but a farmer? Can’t he be an artist too if he digs the dirt in a way that’s true to the Spark within himself? Give a man shovel, a field of dirt, time to think about it, friends to impress, and he’ll dig a pure expression of his innermost world—a hole as deep as he can manage. And this isn’t some nihilistic fling, it’s much simpler than that. It’s a hole. The Solitant will argue that if a man digging a pit into a field is an ‘artist’ then the word is as useless as an unmarked weight.
A sheep-shearer plying her shears is then an artist. 
A tax collector can be an artist if he’s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of greed. 
There is a need here, the Solitant argues, for a word with walls. The true artist, the divine instrument, must be held apart from the self-dwelling horde.
The Old Jandri word for ‘artist’ is lost to time, but there is a word in what’s left of that language fit for adoption—burshegee. Literally, burshegee means something like ‘fertile ground’, but in the Solitant tradition it means ‘true artist’. It doesn’t mean quite the same thing as ‘virtuoso’ because true artistry has almost nothing to do with what a person does, whether it be painting, pit-digging, sheep-shearing, or finessing balance sheets. Some true artists never make anything at all, yet true artists they remain because true artists—fertile ground—this is a state of mind. 
Such a mind is not necessarily noble, or righteous, or even intelligent. In fact, the mind of the true artist is often marked by comic excess—too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and so exaggerated is the sense of self that it becomes impossible to describe the person without resorting to sarcasm.
For example—Mandrameen was the humblest humble that ever humbled.
When asked what he did for a living, Mandrameen would say, “Nothing important. I paint things”, and then he’d add, “for whatever that is worth”. Then he’d strut around the grand Hrkan galleries and this charade of humility melted away because he could not hide his contempt for his contemporaries.
He’d stand in front of a painting and say, “This piece really moves me,” and then he’d make a show of walking away. All must bear witness to his mop of black hair as it flounced itself in time with his skinny, stiff-backed step.
Or he’d say, “I weep at every stroke,” and then he’d flash a knowing smile. 
He’d say these things directly to a fellow artist’s face if he could get to it. He didn’t think of it as mean-spirited because artists, like himself, were safe targets for playful derision. It wasn’t the person he was making fun of, it was their failed attempts to express themselves, and those are completely different things. He’d never go after the person, no. Artists are the best people. It takes the best kind of person to put themselves in front of others and push through the barbs. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to a life of sad obscurity.
Mandrameen would say to Vigram, “You haven’t the faintest idea of what you’re talking about.” Vigram’s crime? He’d said that he liked a painting that he shouldn’t have. Vigram’s wealth be damned, Mandri knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if, by some cosmic absurdity, he wasn’t correct in any of the literal, figurative, or spiritual senses, then ‘correctness’ did not belong to the domain of humanity. It was certainly out of Vigram’s reach. Old Vigram was not an artist, not even the hole-in-the-field kind. He’d made his fortune as a creditor. Meanwhile Mandrameen, when he was ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters.
And his were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brush strokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he’d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait the paint was amply applied via a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of thick umber on thin black he could define the chestnut skin, the high-arched cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, even the mood of the piece. One single stroke! He once painted a woman’s portrait using just twenty-four strokes—count them, twenty-four—and it was a true, vivid likeness. There were few extra nibbles here and there to make the eyes glisten and the cleavage heave, but those hardly counted. It didn’t stop Vigram from marveling at how young Mandrameen packed so much information into so few slips of paint.
“My dear Mandri,” Vigram would say, “These are the marks of genius!”
He’d say it often.
He paid Mandri for lessons.
This was something of a charity, for Mandri was twenty years old and despite his great talent in such a sacred discipline, he was inexplicably poor.
These lessons were given in Vigram’s countryside estate, a good way away from the must and crust of Meskalim. The days started with breakfast, where Vigram, a burly old man with a bald head and brown belly-beard that he kept oiled and trimmed, would push Mandri to explain why he hadn’t yet achieved success. Each week he’d put the question in a different way, but it was always about that same basic thing—why wasn’t Mandri swimming in money? Painters were richly rewarded throughout the Hrkan world. He should be swimming in money.
Mandri tried to explain that financial success, when it comes to art, has little to do with skill or quality. Novelty plays a role, but mostly it’s about preening tongues and critic’s pens. It’s about how many people knew the raw fact of your existence. Vigram always pushed back, and today Mandri settled the matter by declaring, in between mouthfuls of seared lizard lung, “I refuse to debase myself by doing what it takes to succeed.”
Vigram then regaled Mandri with the story of his own life, and he’d tell it in a way so as to suggest that accumulating wealth was the easiest thing in the world and that Mandri could do it too. Vigram had told the story so many times that Mandri could tell it right back.
First, inherit four ounces of silver. This may seem like an insurmountable obstacle for some, but if Vigram could do it, anyone could.
Next, loan those four ounces to two brothers who run a bakery. Make sure it's a bakery that supplies a Solitant temple with bread—that’s a surefire bet because temples are always the last thing the mob will burn down in lean times. The temple and the bakery brothers might accuse you of committing usury against Solraheen Himself, because you are, but if you get together with a priest and pray about it around a jug of beer and then flash him a slip of silver, the bleary shine will blind him.
After that, lend smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who need emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. Split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim’s bond market. There’s not much money in Meskalim itself, but it has a busy port and that means access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.
From there, it’s a simple matter of sprouting six more eyes, four more limbs, and now that you’ve become a human spider you’ll be able to spin a web of silver that stretches into every corner of the holy continent. The fools will walk right into the net of debt. The wiggling sticks them snug. You pick out the salvageable ones for your own use, and now you’ve got a little brood of spiders pouring over lists of sums credited and debts owed, and as long as you maintain a layer of abstraction between these creatures and your muscle, it’s all self-sustaining.
And that’s it. Now you have a comfortable life and idle hours to spend however you please.
“No debasement necessary,” Vigram added.
Mandri chowed down on the cold, crumbled chunks of what he supposed was black-sauced beef spleen. Most of Vigram’s breakfast foods were unfamiliar, as Vigram could afford to eat a different delicacy for every meal, every day of the week. He also had a chronic toothache, so he preferred foods that had to be scooped with sand clam shells and sauces that would stick to the roof of the mouth. This toothache also forced Vigram to talk out the side of his mouth in a wincing drawl.
“Mandri, you know all about art. And that’s why I respect you so much. But I know all about money, and at a certain point you have to join them up, because the world doesn’t work how it should. It works how it works. You have to make a living.”
Mandri wolfed down a peach-jellied egg, then meekly agreed. He would have told Vigram what he really thought, but he really, really, needed Vigram’s money.
Vigram clapped his meaty hands and a nameless slave came in and took their plates. Then the two of them headed out to Vigram’s vine-trellised, brown-brick patio, where Vigram set himself to work in setting up a canvas and an easel which he claimed to have built himself—slaves cut and planed the lumber, brewed the glue, hammered the metal fittings, but mighty Vigram did the rest.
Mandri said, “Are you sure you want to do this here?”
“Why not?” asked Vigram. “Is there something wrong?”
“No. There’s nothing wrong, exactly. It’s that this light is going to make things so much more difficult.”
The patio’s roof was not yet thick enough with vines, and that meant a richly dappled light would fall upon the sitter.
Vigram shook his head, which sent his great brown beard wiggling as if it were alive. “My dear Mandri,” he said, letting his drawl roll heavy. “The patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.”
“Well, you can worry about ‘magical vestures’ when you’re good enough to make a face look like a face.”
“No,” said Vigram. “I won’t have it any other way. A magical vesture for a magical subject.”
As if bidden from the heavens by Vigram’s words, his daughter, Lora, joined them on the patio. She was Vigram’s favorite subject, Mandri’s age, the only one of Vigram’s five children willing to sit for him. 
“Isn’t she a subject fit for holy oils?” Vigram asked.
“Undoubtedly,” said Mandri as his eyes flicked to Lora without intention, though Vigram interpreted it, as he always did, as the most rabid of intentions. The old man’s eyes squeezed out a suggestive smile, as if to give Mandri his patriarchal blessing.
Mandri pretended he didn’t notice.
Lora was good natured, comely, with clear brown skin and sun-kissed cheeks. She was also a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen lowing in the adjacent field. Many a young man would leap at the chance to be with such a fertility goddess, unfortunately Mandri didn’t want to have children.
“Help her up,” Vigram commanded. “I’ll ready the canvas and paint.”
Mandri did as he was told and helped Lora up onto a high-legged stool. Lora let her fingers linger on his arm. Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his muse.
Again, Mandri did as he was told and took up his post behind the old man.
Vigram snatched up a stick of soft charcoal and put down his first exploratory marks. This was always always the most difficult phase. Every work of art has to be built on a firm foundation. Get it wrong and everything that comes after will be wrong as well. Unfortunately for Vigram, he had that all-too-common beginner’s habit of refusing to use his god-damned brain. He started drawing wherever his hand randomly landed and what happened next was up to Solraheen. The end result was that Lora’s head was, somehow, too small. It was also too left-of-center. There’d be an awkward expanse behind her flower-studded curls.
“Hold on,” said Mandri. “You’re moving too fast. Don’t think of this as a portrait—not yet. All we have right now is an oval, a rectangular canvas, and where that oval sits on the canvas. All you’re doing is putting an oval on the canvas.”
“Right.”
“So think about where’s the best place to put that oval. Make use of the whole canvas.”
“Yes, yes you’re right.”
Vigram rubbed the marks away with his palm.
He stepped back.
He studied Lora.
He stepped again to the canvas.
Then he scratched a black oval right back where it had been.
“Is that better?” he asked with all the awareness of a potted plant.
“It needs to be a little bigger, I think.”
Vigram drew the oval again, but only slightly larger. Mandri encouraged the old man to continue, and from then on, almost every mark Vigram made was accompanied by a look back to Mandri for reassurance. 
“Don’t look at me, look at her.”
“I need to know if it is right or if it is wrong.”
“Assume that it’s always wrong, and then try to figure out why it’s wrong, and then fix it.”
There was a glimmer of understanding in Vigram’s eye, but as soon as it came it faded. He twirled his beard between his fat fingers, then asked, “If the mark I make is always wrong, then how could I ever move past it? I’ll be redrawing the same line over and over again.”
“You move on when you want to move on.”
“Then I want to move on. I’m here to paint, not draw.”
“Well, hold on. Finish…finish the basic shapes, at least.”
“Alright.”
Vigram ‘finished’ the ‘basic shapes’. He looked to Mandri for final approval.
“It’s your paint,” Mandri said with a shrug. “But you need to understand the importance of the drawing.”
“I do understand. You talk about it all the time.” Vigram tossed his charcoal over his shoulder and squealed with delight as he picked up his favorite brush.
Mandri watched on in confusion as Vigram threw down the first splotches of color in a flurry. The man was building an affront to the senses, and Mandri was getting paid to witness it. But he was more frightened of Lora. He couldn’t deny a glance or two in her direction, for she was the sitter. Whenever his eyes wandered over to her, her smile would perk up. 
“Mandri, stop flirting with my daughter.”
Vigram hid himself behind the canvas and gave Mandri a knowing nod and encouraging smile.
“I’m not flirting,” said Mandri. “I’m checking proportions.”
“And how are her proportions?” Vigram’s eyebrows jumped suggestively. Lora, for her part, squirmed in her seat, blushing in feigned embarrassment, loving the attention.
Mandri said, “Vigram, let’s focus on your painting.”
“What’s wrong with it?”
Mandri paused to give Vigram time to refocus his energy into the task at hand. Mandri knew what was wrong with the piece—he could write a treatise on it. He also knew that Vigram wouldn’t be able to handle an unvarnished critique. If the man got upset, then there’d be no more money, and Mandri really, really needed the money. Mandri was forced to compromise with himself and exercise restraint. He had to do what everyone else does—start off with a disarming compliment. Pick out a positive to open the student up to critique. The problem, at present, was that there was literally nothing good there on canvas.
“It’s good,” said Mandri.
He leaned back, sank into his hip and made every honest effort to study the mishmash that Vigram was putting down. Unfortunately, Vigram had that other beginner’s habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes—while that can be done, it's a very dangerous thing to do. Oils dry too slowly to mess around. 
“Vigram…”
“I know, I know.”
“I’m gonna say it anyway. You need to get the color correct on the palette before it touches the canvas. That’s what the palette is there for.” 
Vigram nodded, then began his work again in earnest, and the morning dragged on.
Eventually Vigram’s assault reached his daughter’s chin and he mixed a bluish shade of bronze. Unless there was some extraordinary circumstance of light and shadow—which there wasn’t—it was a color meant for the chin of a Jandri man who keeps a close shave. Vigram slapped it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes darted between his daughter and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips curled into a frown and he muttered, “That’s not quite right.” He gave Mandri a sheepish grin, then he stabbed his brush into a slug of white, and he rubbed it into that manly chin.
“That’s not quite right either.” 
This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.
“It’s not bad,” he said.
The charcoal guidelines looked like they were bleeding pus.
One of those leafy shadows had drifted over Lora’s left eye, and Vigram had an amusing go at it—it looked like a bandit’s eye-patch. 
“It’s good,” said Mandri. “No really, I mean it. It’s not a masterpiece, but it’s… it’s on the path.”
“It does not do justice to such a fine daughter,” said Vigram.
Mandri tapped his bottom lip as Vigram stepped aside to let him fully into the work.
Mandri said, “Do you remember what I said last week?”
“You said that I need to study hands.”
“And have you done that?”
“Nope!”
Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. The fingers on his painting looked like a bundle of sticks.
“The only things that matter are the face and the hands.” Mandri was struggling to say useful things. “You could give Lora a hundred ribs and a single breast and people will forgive you for it, so long as you’ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, anatomically correct hands.”
“I’ll do better with the hands.”
Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his frustrated brow. This whole ordeal was a waste of time. If he didn’t need that money so damned bad, he’d have quit after the first session.
His little reverie was interrupted when Lora jumped from the stool, crying out, “Mandri’s ox is eating the apples!”
She pointed an accusing finger to the hill beyond the trellis. All eyes peered through the vines, where some twenty yards away stood Mandri’s one true possession—a skinny yellow ox named Gil. Gil was craning his head up high to reach a sweet red apple. His long pink tongue was stuck out and twirling, but all it was doing was batting the ripened fruit around in circles.
Vigram turned to Mandri, “Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?”
“Gil has a right to go where he wants,” Mandri said firmly.
“Well he’s not got a right to my apples! If that ox eats anything that’s not already on the ground, I’ll have my man butcher it up. Now get the beast tied up.”
“Where are you going?”
“I’m going to pick out a wine for brunch. Lora, my sweet, help the boy clean up. I’ll call you both when refreshment is ready.”
Old Vigram set his brush down and wiped his charcoal-stained fingers on an untouched corner of the canvas, and then he plodded off, leaving Mandri trapped on the patio with Lora.
Lora slid off her stool and sauntered over to Mandri, where her intrepid hand brushed the back of his arm. “I can help you,” she said. “I know how to catch animals.”
“Gil is not an animal,” said Mandri. “His Spark’s as bright as yours or mine.”
“He’s an ox, Mandri.”
“I’m serious. Watch…” Mandri turned to Gil, and out of her reach. “Gil!” he shouted. “Gil, C’mere!”
Gil’s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. His protuberant eyes stared back through the vines, a dumb, bovine ogle. Slobber dripped unheeded from his lower lip. 
“Gil!”
Gil blinked, then got distracted by the long grass brushing his belly, and he bit off a mouthful and began to chew.
“Gil! Hup!”
This startled Gil into motion, sending him trotting towards the patio. The flap of his heavy dewlap rolled his short-hair hide back and forth over his sagging, aged spine.
“Poor old creature,” Lora muttered.
“Ah, he’s fine,” Mandri said.
Gill clopped into the patio as if it were his living room.
Lora hid herself behind Mandri in mock fright. It was enough of an excuse for her to squeeze Mandri’s scrawny shoulders and press herself against him.
“You don’t need to be scared of Gil,” said Mandri. “He’s the nicest old ox you’ll ever meet. He likes a good scratch right between the eyes. See?” He stepped aside, out of Lora’s grasp, and stepped to greet Gil. 
Lora ventured hesitantly towards Gil, and Gil let her scratch him into a cooing moo.
She said, “He’s a sweet thing, isn’t he?”
“He is. But not as sweet as Vigram’s painting.”
Lora eyed her father’s painting and stifled a smile, but the depiction of her was so ridiculous that her smile grew bigger and bigger, until she finally broke out in laughter.
“He’s turned me into a demon,” she said. “It’s the hands, they look like claws.”
“I try to tell him…hands require practice.”
Lora sidled up to Mandri, grabbed his hand and said, with all the lust and must of a woman in heat, “Artists need strong and dexterous hands, don’t they?” 
“Uh…No…well, yes, but, uh… I don’t have any, uh, dexterity. I actually haven’t painted anything in years.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Lora. “We’ve seen you paint.”
“Demonstrations, sure, but those don’t really count.” 
“Then what have you been doing up on that little farm of yours?”
“Farming.”
Lora rolled her eyes. “Look at you,” she said. “You’ve never farmed a day in your life.”
“I’m not lying.”
Lora stepped closer and purred, “Then why don’t you paint anymore?”
“Uh…it would be too hard to explain.” Mandri tore himself away from Lora yet again and tried to busy himself with Vigram’s mess. There was enough untouched pigment left on the palette for four more portraits. He moved to scrape a slap of yellow back into its little clay jar.
“Try to explain it,” said Lora.
“Well, painting is, uh...”
Mandri tried to think of a palatable excuse, then he realized it was sitting right in his hands. “It’s too expensive. I mean, look at all this pigment. The canvas. At this point in my life it’d take me weeks to afford all this. Your father makes this in half a day.”
“You could make that much too if you came and worked for him.”
“I’m not good with money.”
“All you’d be doing is signing a scrap of paper every now and again.”
Lora picked up a dirty brush and twirled its horse-hair head through the muddy colors of the palette.
She said, “You know, he doesn’t actually care about learning to paint. The only reason he pays for these lessons is because you would starve if he didn’t. He likes you. I like you.” She batted her eyes and tried to catch him staring.
“Is that how he feels about it?” Mandri asked. “Well I don’t need charity.”
Lora sighed. “Mandri, I’ve seen your farm. My dad’s seen your farm. Everybody’s seen your farm. It’s not a farm.”
“It’s a farm to me. And it’s a farm to Gil. Isn’t that right, Gil?”
He turned to the animal, but Gil wasn’t even on the patio. He’d snuck his way back up the hill to lick at that damned apple.
Lora rolled the handle of the paintbrush in between her fingers. She said, “The girls in Meskalim all say that you’re a eunuch.”
“What?”
“They say that you’re a eunuch.”
“I’m not a eunuch.”
“An old woman came looking for you. She said you were a eunuch, too.”
“A woman came here just to tell you I’m a eunuch?”
“She called you a gaburshegee. She said that means eunuch, and she was looking for you.”
“When?”
“Yesterday.”
“Well she couldn’t have been looking for me, because I’m not a eunuch.”
“Prove it.”
Mandri’s jaw dropped. 
“What?”
Lora crossed her arms and gave Mandri a sly, expectant look. “I’m a woman, Mandri. What’s your problem?”
“I’m not going to pull my uglies out just to prove they’re there.”
Mandri believed this would be enough to put her off, but Lora was a girl trained in the art of bashful men. She saw right through him and made her move, grabbed his arm and pulled him close. She caught his eyes and forced him to confront her lilac’d scent, her pounding heat, her smooth skin, her honeyed, aching lips.
“Lora…” 
Mandri knew he had to be very careful here.
“You’re a beautiful girl, but—”
“But what? You go in for men?”
“No!—no.”
“I could be good for you,” she said.
“And what do you get out of it?”
She squeezed herself against him and her warmth was overwhelming.
“You could be good for me,” she said. 
“You would not say that if you really knew me.”
“What’s there to know? You’re just a boy.”
Mandri’s eyes widened at the sight of her inviting smile, and the soft shadows of the vines overhead just so happened to frame her sparkling brown eyes with the most magnificent golden light. A magical vesture indeed. 
He nearly broke. He probably would have too if Gil hadn’t reached his apple and let out a triumphant bellow. 
“MMMMRRRRUUUUUooooooooooOOOOOOOoooo!”
Gil’s roar was so loud and sickly that it startled Mandri and Lora out of their awkward embrace.
Mandri backed up against the vines.
“Lora, this is not what I’m here for.”
“It’s what I’m here for,” said Lora.
Mandri looked for a means of escape and his eyes stumbled over one of the house’s misty window panes, behind which Vigram’s bearded face was smiling so wide it seemed he was about to stamp a return on interest.
“Okay. I’m leaving.”
Mandri practically leaped off the patio.
Lora shouted after him, “What is wrong with you?”
Mandri did not answer. There was no point in answering. This was not what he was here for. He ran, then jogged, then walked, then stopped when he realized that he was forgetting something.
“Gil!”
But Gil was already trotting down the gentle hill to follow. Mandri waited up, and together they headed for the estate’s swing gate.
Vigram was on their heels, marching fast with his robe hiked up and his long beard tucked under his arm.
“What happened!?” he shouted.
“Nothing,” said Mandri. “I’m leaving.”
“You’re leaving?”
“Look, Vigram, I don’t want to be a bother, but could I get the money?”
Vigram frowned. He reached into his robe and pulled out a small brown sack of coin. He held it in the air as if to lure Mandri back towards the house.
He said, “Lora thinks you’re using this money to buy burgeons from Geem.”
“Burgeons?” asked Mandri.
“You deny it?”
“What would Lora know?”
“Do you deny it?”
“Of course I deny it.”
Vigram eyed Mandri with suspicion, then he shook the bag of coin and said, “I want you to promise me that you’re not going to use this money to buy burgeons.”
“I promise.”
Vigram looked down his nose at Mandri and scratched his beard. He said, “I’m going to give you this money because I owe it. If I find out you’re using this for burgeons, then our arrangement here is finished. You won’t be coming back. And for Sol’s sake, buy some apples for this creature of yours.”
“I will.”
Vigram put the bag in Mandri’s palm, and Mandri tucked it into his robe.
“You’ve got the gift of the brush, Mandri. Solraheen’s given you a gift. It’s a sacred gift.”
“I know. I’ll see you later.”
Mandri and Gil walked out the gate. 
“I’m serious!” Vigram called out. “You’ve been given a gift!”
Mandri waved back.
It wasn’t a gift, not a special one, at least. He could paint a portrait in twenty-four strokes, but few would be impressed if they watched him do it. He would spend hours and hours making those single strokes. He’d put one down, and if it wasn’t exactly right, he’d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and he’d repeat this for as long as it took. Days. A week. Longer. Had to wait for the paint to dry. People only ever saw the finished product, those twenty-four strokes, and upon seeing it they assumed that Mandri’s brush went slip-slap-boom and there’s a true likeness. That story couldn’t be further from the truth. Mandri’s real talent was his tolerance of tedium, and that’s a talent a person can lose—Mandri was living proof. 
When he and Gil got to the top of the big hill that overlooked Vigram’s estate, he took one last look back. Vigram was still standing in his drive. The old man waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, “No burgeons!”
“Yeah, yeah,” Mandri muttered under his breath.
“They’ll douse your Spark!”
Mandri waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem’s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. They were Down-Valley burgeons, decent stuff but the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle so they’d split too quickly and the insides would dry out before Mandri could get to them. But that was all Geem had so he bought them. 
Mandri and Gil continued along the road, stomping their way through the muddy wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, humming and mooing nursery rhymes until they made it back Mandri’s farm. There he could finally relax and lose all sense of himself in the deep and blessed bliss brought on by beer spiked through with burgeons.

            <Text>I had an overdose on cocaine on christmas. That's when my family learned about my substance abuse, self harm and suicidal thoughts. I promised and kept my promise of not taking anymore drugs. They told me that I shouldn't have kept my feelings a secret and they would be there for me, to call if I feel bad, suicidal or about to relapse. I started therapy and medication.Now I have good days and really bad days. My family, but specifically my dad, are critical of me when I have depressive behaviour, am serious, and don't engage much in conversation. He scolds me when I take too long to complete non-essential tasks (like not doing urgent errands, not getting a job even though I'm severely depressed, have extremely low energy, and don't need money or take from others since I got a rental income). He complains about how I am fine some days and not okay some days. Everything they demand from me is exactly how I am on cocaine, but they don't want me to take cocaine, but hate who I am sober.How can they say I shouldn't have hidden my feelings when that's what they always ask from me? When I have the slightest amount of energy I have to use it to act as if I'm fine, cause they can't even stand me not smiling and not being fun to be around.There's no place for me to exist as myself.
