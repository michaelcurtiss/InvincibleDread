        <Text>On the sixth day, or was it the seventh? On the seventh day, they crossed a charnel road, and on the other side of it was a small rock cairn splattered with white paint. This marked the grave of a pilgrim. An epitaph had been written on a stick of wood and stuck in the ground right next to it, but the writing had been scoured into illegibility.
No one knew which shrine the charnel road led to, or from which city the road began.</Text>
