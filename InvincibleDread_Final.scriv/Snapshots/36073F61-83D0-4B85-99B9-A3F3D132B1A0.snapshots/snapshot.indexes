        <Title>Before Ixnay Obo</Title>
        <Text>The next day they came to a natron flat two miles long and as many wide. Seb broke off small chunks of the white stuff and rubbed it on her few remaining teeth. She said it had medicinal properties. Mandri knew it for its use in pigments. A tiny amount mixed in with quartz sand and copper ore made a blue called Campor Blue, called as such because the most vibrant hues came from Campor, where more than a hundred slaves spent their days sorting the quartz sand for impurities grain by grain with tweezers. Only the cleanest, purest grains of crystal were worthy.
Moteah found this fact distasteful instead of impressive. Mandri was quick to agree. Obo didnâ€™t much care.
They crossed the flat without incident.</Text>
