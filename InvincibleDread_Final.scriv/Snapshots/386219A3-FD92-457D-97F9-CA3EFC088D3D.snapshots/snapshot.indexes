        <Title>Before Ixnay Obo</Title>
        <Text>Under his feet were holes burrowed by some strange species of yellow-headed lizard. At night those lizards escaped from their haunts and searched for food. He could see them silhouetted against the starry sky. Their mounds were covered with picked cleaned bones of all manner of mouse, lizard, ground-nesting birds, and berrybush stems.
He wondered if these lizard mounds had once been cities. There were lizard mounds lining to the horizon, and beyond that to the ends of the world.
A distant lizard sent forth a screaming hiss into the night. Other lizards from other lizard cities immediately took up his challenge, and for a good few hands the peace of the starry sky was upset by the hissing, hacking, crying foul of yellow headed brats. </Text>
