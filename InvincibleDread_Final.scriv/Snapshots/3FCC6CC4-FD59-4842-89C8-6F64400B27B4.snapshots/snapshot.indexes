        <Title>Scratch Ayram dead</Title>
        <Text>There’s nothing complicated about terror. Mandri was all too familiar with its tired routine—first it startled him into stupidity, and then it spurred him into action, or petrified him, according to the flavor of the moment. He always knew it was coming on, and he knew what it would do, and he knew there was no fighting it. When Elrahet suggested, in her witchy way, that his moment of passage was near, he became terrified. He ran past that golden statue of Solraheen and made sure to rub kiss its hand, but that didn’t help at all. Terror trembled his knees as he ran through the accursed temple’s bowels, bumping his nose and toes on stone shelves and cabinet footings because he wasn’t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn’t allowed, according to Moto, because there wasn’t any time to light one up, even though it only took a fifth of a god-damned finger. As it goes with terror—reason is not allowed a say. If it was, he might have been able to sort through how he felt about his companions.
He hated these Ayramun for leading him here.
He loved these Ayramun for protecting him from the dark.
He hated them and loved them in equal turns.
Moto led them into a dark dead end, and Mandri hated him. Moto led them into a windowed hall flush with fresh night air, and Mandri loved him. Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated her. Mandri slipped on spot of Seb’s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated her—Seb was the sole exception to this confusing succession of states in which blurred together and hinted at a deeper reality which Mandri could not articulate. Love and hate, it seemed, were only crude approximations—it was as if there was a color portrait to be painted here, but all Mandri had were pigments black and white.
It reminded him, and this was not the time for it, but it reminded him of Solraheen, for His love was both comforting and terrifying. Yes, Mandri feared a loving Divine. That was the habit of terror, it teased the ambivalence out of him.
He hated Elrahet for her witchy mumblings as she scampered along in the dark.
“This isn’t right,” she hissed through clenched teeth. “Isn’t right, isn’t right, isn’t right.”
He loved her because she seemed to be the only one who knew what was going on.
“This way!” she barked when Moto ran past a doorway.
Moteah yanked Mandri’s arm.
“Put your sword away you idiot!”
He didn’t even know he had it out.
“You’re going to stab me,” she said.
“I won’t.”
“Put it away.  Damn it Moto, why’d you give him a sword?!”
Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade. Good thing he did, because not long after, Elrahet took a sharp turn into another dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. 
“What are we doing?” Moteah asked with venom. Moto, the prime object of her ire, turned towards the dark and said, “We should wait here for Ayram.”
“Don’t act like you meant to run in here.”
Seb, who was bringing up the rear, said, “There’s no point in waitin’ up for Ayram. He’s dead.”
Moto dismissed Seb’s dour pronouncement with a sneer. “Ayram’s not dead.”
“Is too,” said Seb. “Saw him swallowed by Mazydfire.”
“He fell down a canyon before the flame even touched him.”
“That’s not what I saw,” said Seb.
“Seb, you can’t see shit.”
“Ayram fell down a canyon?” Moteah asked.
Moto said, “He jumped into it. To dodge the flame.”
And so commenced an argument, and Mandri began to hate them all. As the insults and half- charges flew, Mandri retreated into a dark corner of this small room. He wished it wouldn’t have been so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. No temple he’d ever been in was so black—and it wasn’t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps because there weren’t any light fittings bolted to the walls. He looked up and noticed that the flat ceiling was completely free from the soot of ages, and in this place there was no hope of natural light—Shulgi was much too thick in the belly for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help you lose yourself, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.
There was art all along the walls for Mandri to distract himself with. Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around this apparent dead end, and they were stacked upon the each other from floor to the ceiling. The walls all throughout the place were carved up like this, and most were painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with lines and lines of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears, there were garden scenes where Old Jandri kings strolled along in quiet contemplation, there were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of martyrs screaming Solraheen’s name as tongues of flame licked their ribs.
Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that was being told. It reminded him of Hrkan tomb art—some rich prick decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when the tomb’s door is sealed, no one is allowed to have a look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and now no one is looking. A monumental waste of good pigment.
No places for candles in a tomb.
No room for natural light either.
Maybe this place’s purpose was to be a tomb.
If it were true, maybe it’d be written here on the wall. Unfortunately, Mandri wasn’t quite sure what he was looking at in terms of narrative. He wasn’t even sure if he were reading the panels in the right direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether?
He looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight. It was hard to see, because not only was the light too dim, but it blinked every time Moto waved his frantic arms to try and express his argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene—the moment of Solraheen’s apotheosis, when He emerged out of void. It was represented here by a blank face emerging from a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark ripping out the stone. Each claw was as wide as two fingers.
“Uh, guys.”
The others were too engrossed in their squabble to hear him. Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.
Mandri raised his voice.
“Hey!”
They all stopped bickering.
“Look at this,” he said, and he pointed up at the beastly gash in Solraheen’s forehead. 
Seb stepped over, studied the defacement, and shrugged. “It’s just some scratches,” he said.
Elrahet waddled over and held her torch high. She stood on her tiptoes to get her eye close to the claw mark. Mandri thought he saw her sniff.
When she balanced back down on her heels her face was gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.
“It is as I feared,” she said.
“What does that mean?” said Purl.
“It means we need to leave.” 
Then the old witch twirled, black robes fluttering, and trotted off into the darkness, expecting everyone else to follow. 
Moto pushed past Mandri to confront Elrahet.
“What about Ayram?”, he asked.
“Ayram can handle himself,” she said, shrugging him off.
“But you don’t even know where you’re going!”
“We make for the backdoor.”
“But you said you don’t remember—”
“It doesn’t matter!” Elrahet declared, and she whacked her conclusion into Moto’s leg with her staff. “The faster we are out of here, the better, and that won’t happen if we’re standing still!”
Their journey through the dark began anew with Elrahet leading the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the smudges in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because she had a vague memory that Shulgi’s backdoor was, in her words, “down and then out.”
They ventured so far down into this temple mountain that it seemed to Mandri this temple was upside down. A temple’s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens, and there should be an ascension to the roof where the penitent could await the coming dawn. But they went down, and the further down they went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. 
Elrahet led them down a wide fan of stairs whose ceiling bowed up into a black void. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts were closing in on them. And after the ceiling, the walls disappeared. Suffice to say, Mandri no longer felt like he was ‘inside’.  The Ayramun were a splotch of light in a sea of darkness. If not for the hard stone under his feet and the faux-brick pattern on it, he would have supposed that they had wandered straight into the depths of Shis.
“I remember now,” said Elrahet.
She practically sprinted past two enormous spiraled columns. These columns were easily four times the size of those in Shulgi’s entrance hall, and they straddled a long tongue of obsidian-studded floor which marked a processional way. The Ayramun hurried past these columns, and ahead was another pair, then another, and another, when finally, they came upon an incredible natural sandstone throne set atop a plinth of granite. Its seat was smooth and featureless, as if carved by a river, and its back was a petrified spire of flame licked into a curl by an unseen of wind.
 Elrahet stopped before it, took a moment catch her breath, then said, “There’s a hall behind.”
She scuttled around the throne, and the Ayramun followed. There behind the throne was a perfectly square doorway cut into the thick wall. They all filtered through, and they hadn’t gotten ten steps into its hall, when Elrahet stopped again. 
Something on the ground had caught her attention.
She set her torch low to the floor.
There, splattered across the stone was a dried splotch of blood. She bent down to touch it, and as she did, a voice rose out of the dark, a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed it was the voice of the mountain itself. 
“What do you make of it, whitch?”
The echo rattled Mandri’s bones, and then came another bout of stupefying terror, for an unaccounted-for voice weighs heavy on the scale of terror, heavier still if it comes spewing out a dark abyss, heavier still if it wheezes and warbles as if issuing forth from the throat of a tortured horse. 
Moto sent his torch spinning in this voice’s direction—straight down the hall. The torch clattered along the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop before a fold of skin.
In its upshot light was a beast for which terror was a pure emotion. It was so large, fat, and bloated, that no of it’s form could be seen. It seemed nothing but a giant blob of bleeding pustules and skin. Mandri knew there there must be a mouth in there somewhere, for its rasping voice echoed out again. 
“Let them shee my gloooory.”
Two enormous braziers erupted in flame to reveal an unmistakably human bag of bloat clogging up the hall, mounding up all the way to the ceiling where, sticking out of the top like a cork was the upper torso of a skinny, white-bearded man shawled in a tattered green robe. On his head was a crown.
Scurrying around in front of this overgrown freak were demon roaches the size of dogs, at least ten of them, with oily-black shells and human hands on the ends of their spike-studded legs. Their faces were an unholy mix between a insect’s and a man’s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling, their mouths gulping air like a fish out of water.
Mandri turned to run, but there was no where to go for climbing on the wall behind were four more of those demon beetles. 
“Hag beetles,” said Elrahet. “The spines inside their shells can kill, and their shells are hard as rock.”
A rumbling laugh boomed out from the fleshy king’s stomach. “Keep your namesh to yourshelf, whitch.”
Elrahet turned to face the bloated lord. “Most putrid king,” she said, “none of us are worthy of a names, and yet a name, the good lord gives.”
The creature smiled. His teeth were black and his spit was tar. The beetle-demons clicked and clacked their, vibrating with their master’s mood.
“A name?” the foul lord mused. “A NAME!? Hhhhaaaaaahhhhh!” The laugh sent a shudder through his whole bloated body. “Poison yourselves with your names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. I and mine are more than a name can bear! LOOK at me!”
He spread his tiny arms against his girth.
Elrahet spat and said, “You have perverted your flesh, Greskal.” She pronounced his name with a scornful leer.
The creature laughed again, burping and as it did.
“Ugh-urp-ahuhhheheh… Greshkal!?… Hah!”
He leaned his bulk forwards to resettle his great stomach after the burp had disturbed it. Mandri suspected that somewhere under the ruddy and calloused flabs of skin on the floor were legs, but he doubted this demon king could do much more than lean.
“I am no longer Greshkal,” the bloated wretch said. “I have become…I have become becoming itshelf! Name me, whitch—I am Amalgamete!”
The echo of his great voice filled the hall and stunned all gathered into silence, all save the hag bettles, who chattered and clicked their teeth.
“Do you think me ugly?” Greskal said. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have split and ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from tar, living tar, for in the dim light it seemed that the lump of flesh in his grip was wriggling like a squealing piglet. He let this piglet slip, and the flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.
“This flesh is the world,” said Greskal as he caressed the welling redness. “Don’t you shee? This is the shtuff of the world into which a Spark thrown. The whiter the light of the Spark, the more this filth gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would shupplicate yourshelves before me as your god.”
Elrahet looked down her nose at Greskal and said, “Your son had a stronger stomach than you. Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.”
A paroxysmal twitch shuddered through Greskal’s body. He pointed to Elrahet and shouted, “Silence that ensnaring womb!”
A black spike shot out of a hag beetle’s body and flew at Elrahet. Moto’s sword lashed out with blinding speed and sent the spike bouncing harmlessly aside. 
Greskal grunted his annoyance. Then he said, with a disapproving stare, “You should offer yourshelves willingly. Be joined together inside my shtomach and taste union for once in your miserable livesh.”
“Oh?” said Elrahet. “You don’t want us to fight back? Does stressed meat taste fouler? Poor thing.”
Greskal grimaced. Tar pooled in his bottom lip. With the natural grace of a man made king from birth, he twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, and waved his minions onward.
“Defense first, keep them off,” Moto said to his sister. “I’ll make the killing blows.”
“I’m going to do what I need to do,” Moteah said as she threw down her pack and drew her sword.
Seb was sweating, staring at the doorway behind them that led to throne room.  There the beetle-demons were now creeping down the wall.
Purl tried to slap the terror out of his cheek.
“Wake up!”
Seb looked Purl in the eye, and said, “You insane!? We don’t have a chance!”
Purl slapped him again.
“Seb! Get hold of yourself!”
Seb spat at her feet. He took off running towards the throne room door.
It was only a ten steps distance. 
Seb made it five.
A hag bettle jumped off the wall, straight towards him. As it flew, its shell parted open, and a blur shot out of it’s back. 
Seb’s body went limp. A black spike was stuck right through his chest, through his pack, and even further—through the Riga’s swaddled head.
Mandri wanted to scream in horror, but no sound came out of his lungs. Seb fell to his knees, and then to the floor, gargling on blood and borcandi juice as he went. His killer, still clinging to him like a leech, retracted its spike back into its shell with a horrifying schlick.
Mandri pulled his sword and held it out as Moto had taught him. His arm trembled. Moto’s lessons didn’t prepare him to deal with an eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis. And there were four of them arrayed in front of him like a pack of a dogs.
“What do I do!?” he screamed at Purl.
“Just stab the damned things!”
The next thought that went through Mandri’s head was that things seem to jump faster when they’re jumping at you.
He shrieked, closed his eyes, and swung out.
He felt his blade hit the beetle’s shell.
There was a squelching crunch.
He was still alive.
The beetle demon was dead at his feet. Its back was absolutely crushed. It’s murderous spike twitched feebly on the floor, and somehow Mandri’s sword was completely bloodless.
The other three beetle-demons took to the walls and scurried hurriedly back across the hall towards Greskal, for Ayram standing in the shadow of the throne room doorway. His spear’s chisel tip was dripping black with beetle-demon blood.
“Oh,” Mandri muttered. “Thank god.”
Ayram’s face, his beard, and his shoulders were plastered in sand.
Elrahet asked, “What’s wrong?”
“Arm’s useless.”
His left arm was tucked into his robe.
“So that’s Greskal?” he asked.
“It is.”
Ayram sighed and gritted his teeth. “We don’t have time for this.”
He hoisted his spear up on his shoulder and walked towards the putrid king.
Greskal smiled at the sight. “I’ve been exshpecting you,” he said. “I have a gift eshpecially for you.”
“Not interested,” Ayram growled.
“Give me a moment. A moment, and you’ll have it.”
Greskal rolled his eyes into white and he gave his head a good shake. This seemed to knock loose some internal blockage, and his shoulders shook as his spine twinged and quivered. Then a wave rolled under his great bulk like the ocean rolling under a seaweed shore. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder. Then Greskal screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered. The wailing of his voice was run ragged by all the souls o those he had consumed.
He leaned back and another wave rippled his stomach. A boil burst open, and in its place was a cavity. Blackness oozed out of it, and when the inevitable shudder came this hole ripped wider. A taloned hand burst forth, and out of the Amalgamete’s stomach poured a great demon slathered in tar.
Half man, it stood up on two legs. Half lizard, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It was bigger than Ayram by a head and had the muscles of a prize-winning ox. Its eyes were blood red, double lidded, and its pupils were embered orange. It licked the air with a forked tongue, caught Ayram’s scent, and hissed. Then it stretched out its limbs for the first time, its arms were ribbons of muscle, it’s back a whip, it’s jaw full of hateful fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself, the coursing power, it curled it’s and seemed to know what it was meant to do—if it didn’t, all it need do to learn was to read the fear on Mandri’s face.
It growled, and the vibration sent the hag-beetles clicking and scratching their spikes against the insides their shells. They turned their dumb, lidless eyes towards the Ayramun.
“Go on, my children,” Greskal wheezed. He winced against another violent spasm that shook his whole body. Then he fainted, and the hag beetles began again to crawl.
“Get back!” Ayram shouted. “Against a wall!” He twirled his spear under his good right arm and spat a challenge towards the reptile freak. A snarl of fangs was the answer, and the demon took a step towards his prey—only one step.
The beetles, still clicking their excitement, scurried wide around both giants while Moto and Moteah herded Mandri, Elrahet, and Purl back into a corner. The hag beetles closed ranks behind Ayram, though they weren’t at all that interested in him. They kept on creeping along the hall, while some had ascended up into the darkness of the ceiling. Mandri could just make out the dull shine of their eyes as they took up positions directly above him.
Ayram took a step backwards.
Then another step.
He and the black demon lizard were at least twenty yards apart, but for the speed between them it might as well have been a single step. The thunder clap of their meeting sent unleashed chaos in the room.
So much happened so fast that Mandri couldn’t keep track.
On the floor, three beetles jumped at once—maybe it was more, he wasn’t sure because the blur of bodies and limbs was terrifying. At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. Before Mandri could flick the tip of his sword, Moto brought his blade down on that hag beetle’s back, and in a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue right behind the beetle’s head.
This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him. Though it’s head tumbled to the floor, it’s body wasn’t fully dead yet—it seized and spasmed, one of its human-handfeet slapped Mandri in the cheek. Mandri would have laughed if it weren’t for the sight of another hag beetle up on the ceiling. It dropped. Things fall faster when they’re falling at you.
This beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri’s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle’s neck and right onto Mandri’s face. The living beetle’s spike flew out of its back, but the dumb thing missed Mandri’s nose because the its eyes were on top its head. It struck out again, and missed again. Twice more, the spike tap-tapped against the stone.
“Dumb bitch!” Mandri shouted.
The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that it’s fishy eyes were staring down right at him.
“Oh, shit.”
Mandri tugged hard on the dead body between them, and as the spike flew down at his face it met instead with the dead beetle’s shell. The beast tried to pound through it like a hammer. Mandri hid himself until somehow, by the grace of Solraheen, that dumb beetle’s severed head fell right in front of his nose.
Purl pulled Mandris sword out of it and said, “Get up.”
Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles, but his hips and thighs were pinned. 
“Give me a hand,” he said.
“Really?!” said Purl. She had one good hand and wasn’t about to drop the sword.
“Kick it off me!”
Purl kicked the top beetle off him, and Mandri was able to push himself free from the other. He got to his feet, wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage—eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smushed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back along the hall. One of these ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the demon, and it was sliced in half by the lizard’s thrashing tail.
Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his spear so fast that it seemed to curved and snap suddenly straight against the lizard’s fending tail. Sparks flew, and the demon recoiled and raged and leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand, then its tail, knocking Ayram’s bar aside as the next set of talons were coming round. Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below the blow, to leave nothing but a swirl of dust between them.
Only now that they were standing still could Mandri see how much they’d ravaged eachother. The demon’s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram’s robe had been half-clawed off and ribbons of flesh hung off his side, exposing the yellow fat, the red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time that he exhaled.  
Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked Moteah’s rump.
“Help him!” the old witch shouted.
Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag-beetles easily enough, but the Newborn was an enemy beyond them.
“Go!” Elrahet screamed.
Moteah took off running towards the battle. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first.
They got halfway to Ayram when the lizard noticed their coming. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and crouched down like a cat, its long tail raised like a scorpion. Outnumbered, it slowly retreated down the hall.
“It’s scared!” said Moto as he and his sister took up positions at Ayram’s bleeding side.
Ayram spat a glob of red and said, “Careful. Don’t let it—”
The newborn jumped.
It jumped all the way up to the ceiling, then bounded off it and over the heads of the three warriors. It hit the ground running straight for Mandri, Elrahet, and Purl.
Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled horror underneath its permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift bounds. Wide-eyed, Mandri stared down his final moments with a terrified calm. Time seemed to condense, allowing him to appreciate the beauty of his killer. This demon was enormous, strong, sleek, and aside from its flapping jaw, it was perfectly symmetrical. No ugly ears. Its scaly skin glistened in the sheen of its afterbirth. Its final leap was tremendous. The sheer size could swallow him up. Curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery—it rolled under Ayram’s spear, which missed.
But the lizard’s bladed tail didn’t miss—it ripped a gash right across Ayram’s exposed stomach.
The lizard crashed into Mandri and sent him sprawling. 
When Mandri recovered, he expected to look up and see the demon hollowing out his chest.
It was on the floor, lifeless. 
Elrahet’s blade was hilted in the top of its skull.
Ayram sank to his knees. A stream of blood issued from the fissure in his stomach.
Elrahet screamed as she ran and caught the giant in her bosom.
Moteah and Moto sprinted up behind. 
“Let me see,” said Moto.
Ayram’s strength gave way and he slumped down onto the old witch’s shoulder. Moto and Moteah seized his arms before Elrahet crumbled under his weight, and they all helped him down to the ground. Elrahet gently laid his head down on the stone and wiped away the muck of battle from his brow with her thumb.
“My child,” said Elrahet. “My child…this I can not heal.”
Ayram’s great heads were clutching at his stomach. His breathing was staggered and wet. He looked at his witch, and his eyes seem filled with fright. He tried to speak—Elrahet shushed him with a finger to her lips.
“I know,” she said. “I know…I will sing your name to Solraheen, and He will know. He will know.”
Ayram’s eyes darted to Moto. He reached out with his bloody hand and his fingers found the strength to grasp Moto’s arm as tight as vice. For a brief moment, the two men beheld each other, shared an unspoken word, then Ayram’s fingers loosened and the light went out of his eyes.
He was dead.</Text>

        <Title>Salavan Dialogue</Title>
        <Text>There’s nothing complicated about terror. Mandri was all too familiar with its tired routine—first it startled him into stupidity, and then it spurred him into action, or petrified him, according to the flavor of the moment. He always knew it was coming on, and he knew what it would do, and he knew there was no fighting it. When Elrahet suggested, in her witchy way, that his moment of passage was near, he became terrified. He ran past that golden statue of Solraheen and made sure to rub kiss its hand, but that didn’t help at all. Terror trembled his knees as he ran through the accursed temple’s bowels, bumping his nose and toes on stone shelves and cabinet footings because he wasn’t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn’t allowed, according to Moto, because there wasn’t any time to light one up, even though it only took a fifth of a god-damned finger. As it goes with terror—reason is not allowed a say. If it was, he might have been able to sort through how he felt about his companions.
He hated these Ayramun for leading him here.
He loved these Ayramun for protecting him from the dark.
He hated them and loved them in equal turns.
Moto led them into a dark dead end, and Mandri hated him. Moto led them into a windowed hall flush with fresh night air, and Mandri loved him. Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated her. Mandri slipped on spot of Seb’s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated her—Seb was the sole exception to this confusing succession of states in which blurred together and hinted at a deeper reality which Mandri could not articulate. Love and hate, it seemed, were only crude approximations—it was as if there was a color portrait to be painted here, but all Mandri had were pigments black and white.
It reminded him, and this was not the time for it, but it reminded him of Solraheen, for His love was both comforting and terrifying. Yes, Mandri feared a loving Divine. That was the habit of terror, it teased the ambivalence out of him.
He hated Elrahet for her witchy mumblings as she scampered along in the dark.
“This isn’t right,” she hissed through clenched teeth. “Isn’t right, isn’t right, isn’t right.”
He loved her because she seemed to be the only one who knew what was going on.
“This way!” she barked when Moto ran past a doorway.
Moteah yanked Mandri’s arm.
“Put your sword away you idiot!”
He didn’t even know he had it out.
“You’re going to stab me,” she said.
“I won’t.”
“Put it away.  Damn it Moto, why’d you give him a sword?!”
Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade. Good thing he did, because not long after, Elrahet took a sharp turn into another dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. 
“What are we doing?” Moteah asked with venom. Moto, the prime object of her ire, had lost his poise the moment everyone else stopped listening to him. “We wait here for Ayram!” he blustered.
“Don’t act like you meant to run in here.”
“I was following Elrahet!”
Seb sucked a hiss between her teeth. “So we jus’ bumblin’ around?”
They all looked to Elrahet, and she mumbled back, “My foot is sore, I need off it.”
Moto moaned and smacked the wall with an open hand. “This is why I should be in charge. Ayram put me in charge, and I say we pause to take a little time to think. Because I don’t think there’s even an Amalgamete in here.”
“Why not?”
“There’s no one to eat.”
Mandri retreated into a dark corner of this small room as the others got into an argument about the Amalgamete’s dietary cycle. Were these demon lords always moving, always preying on stomachs? Did they need to rest after consuming a tribe three-thousand strong?
Mandri wished this temple wouldn’t have been so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. It wasn’t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps because there weren’t any light fittings bolted to the walls. Whoever built this place wanted it to be dark. The flat ceiling was completely free from the soot of ages, and this room had no hope of natural light—Shulgi was much too thick in the belly for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help the unrighteous lose themselves, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.
Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around the blocky walls of this apparent dead end, and they were stacked upon the each other from floor to the ceiling. The walls all throughout the place were carved up like this, and most were painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with lines and lines of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears, there were garden scenes where Old Jandri kings strolled along in quiet contemplation, there were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of Solraheen’s dark brother, Schisol, burning martyrs who screamed as tongues of flame licked their ribs.
Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that was being told. It reminded him of Hrkan tomb art—some rich lick decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when the tomb’s door is sealed no one is allowed to have a look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and now no one is looking. A monumental waste of good pigment.
No places for candles in a tomb.
No room for natural light either.
“Is this a tomb?” he whispered over his shoulder to Obo. He was surprised to find that Obo had turned around his litter and was peering around Mandri’s neck at the art.
He said, “If it were a tomb, there’d be writing. To be honest, I’m having trouble reading the narrative.”
“Same.”
Mandri wasn’t even sure if he were reading the panels in the right direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether?
He looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight. It was hard to see, because not only was the light too dim, but it blinked every time Moto waved his frantic arms to try and express his argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene—the moment of Solraheen’s birth, when He emerged out of void. It was represented here by a blank face emerging from a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark ripping out the stone. Each claw was as wide as two of his own fingers.
“Uh, guys.”
The others were too engrossed in their squabble to hear him, as Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.
Mandri raised his voice.
“Hey!”
They all stopped bickering and stared.
“Look at this.” Mandri pointed at the beastly gash in Solraheen’s forehead. Seb stepped over and studied the defacement with a critical eye. “It’s just scratches.”
“Let me see,” Elrahet grumbled as she waved Mandri and Seb aside with her torch. She stood on her tiptoes and stretched her leather neck to sniff it. When she balanced back down on her heels her wrinkled face was gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.
“It is as I feared,” she said bitterly, and she eyed those gathered with contempt. “No more mewling.” She then pushed past Moto and trotted off into the darkness of the hallway, black robes fluttering, expecting everyone else to follow. 
“What about Ayram?” Moto whined as he took off after her. Moteah and Seb quickly followed, leaving Mandri and Obo alone in the pitch black room.
“Will we not be joining them?” Obo asked.
Mandri whispered back, “Hold on,” and he fished around in his robe’s pocket for his burgeon. He wasn’t about to go running through a demon-infested temple with out some way seeing a demon before it jumps. Thinking the God’s Eye sight would reveal their Sparks, he unstopped his burgeon’s tiny thorn-plug, and he shook a drop of juice onto his outstretched tongue.
His journey through the dark began anew. Elrahet led the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the scratches in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because where else would an Amalgamete dwell but deep? They ventured so far down into this temple mountain that it seemed to Mandri this building was upside down. A temple’s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens. There should be an ascension to the roof where the penitent could await the coming dawn. But he went down, and the further down he went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. 
Elrahet led them all down a wide fan of stairs whose ceiling and walls bowed out into a black void. They had stumbled into a monumental underground expanse, a throne room fit for a god. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts closed in on them. Suffice to say, Mandri no longer felt like he was ‘inside’, and despite his supreme misgivings they continued on. Mandri felt smaller and the terror was growing, and he huddled close to the Ayramun in their dinghy of torchlight set adrift this a sea of darkness. If not for the hard stone under Mandri’s feet and the fractal cubic pattern etched onto it, he might have lost his wits completely.
That pattern was mesmerizing, hairs of black squares lining larger squares, and as he walked this pattern gave way to a processional of obsidian-studded squares. This processional was straddled on either side by enormous stone columns shaped as legs, legs whose bodies disappeared into the interminable blackness above.
Elrahet picked up speed and purpose, and she led them past these columns while Mandri prayed for the God’s Eye sight to come to him that he might see whatever winged demons hid in the shadows of the god-sized uglies above. 
At pace, they reached the end of the hall. This end was a flat gray granite wall etched with carvings that matched the temple’s exterior—faces inside of faces, howling animal, untamed men, snarling demons, and all these faces radiated out of a central circle which ringed a sandstone throne, stone as red as a rose, a throne uplifted by of a narrow set of stairs. This throne’s seat and arms were smooth and featureless, fashioned from river-bloated stone, while its back was a billowing slab carved to look like flame licked into a curl by an unseen of wind.
The throne’s seat was as empty as the rest of the temple, which is to say it was filled with malevolent purpose. Mandri felt an unease come over him at the sight of it. He felt outnumbered against the great emptiness around him. That’s when noticed that Seb was missing. And the moment he noticed it, Moteah noticed it. The whites of her eyes bulged as she counted and counted again—only four were present, only four, and she counted again despite the obviousness of it.
“Where’s…where’s Seb?!”
The question choked her throat as she held her own torch out towards the void, hoping to catch sight of Seb lagging just behind.
Elrahet and Moto spun around, and upon seeing their number diminished by one, Moto drew his sword.
“Seb!?” he shouted.
The old witch smacked his thigh with her cane.
“Quiet!” she shushed. “You’ll wake Schisol Himself from the dead.”
Moto set his disturbed temper upon Mandri.  suspicion.
“Where is she!?”
“I have no idea,” Mandri, fear trembling his voice.
“Did you do anything to her? Let me see your sword,” Moto demanded.
“What?”
“Let me see it!”
Mandri fumbled at his sword’s hilt, and as he pulled it out he dropped it. The hilt and blade clanged on stone floor, and this cavernous hall it magnified into peal of thunder.
Moto clenched his jaw and shuddered. He after making sure Mandri his great displeasure, he lowered his torch over the blade and studied the sheen of light, looking for signs of use, but it was clean.
“Wait,” said Mandri, “You think I killed Seb in the dark?”
“Did you? Did either of you do anything that—”
Obo climbed up in his litter to peer over Mandri’s shoulder. He interrupted Moto’s frenzied mood by stating, calmly, “We didn’t do anything to the woman. I fact, I watched her scamper away from the group as soon as we entered the hall.”
“What?”
“I watched her—”
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
“I am not the woman’s Minder.”
“Where did she go?”
“That way,” Obo said as he pointed to a perfectly square doorway which opened the wall to the right of the throne’s stairs. Moto moved towards it, but he stopped when Obo called out after him.
“I wouldn’t run so quick if I were you,” said Obo. “There’s a foul smell coming from that hall.”
Elrahet paid this warning no mind as she brushed past Moto and took the lead again. She rushed through that square doorway. Mandri picked up his sword, and followed everyone else in chasing after the witch.
The doorway lead to another large hall, though it was much smaller than the throne room, for while the its length disappeared into darkness the ceiling and walls were brushed by the light of their torches.
Elrahet hadn’t gotten twenty steps inside when she stopped cold.
She hunched over her cane and peered into the emptiness ahead. Mandri watched her aged face for some sign of fear.
Her eye twitched at the sound of a faint squelching that brought to mind Seb’s borcandi chewing.
“Seb!” Moto shouted out.
His holler drew an angry side-long glance from Elrahet, and if that wasn’t enough to shut him up, a voice rose out of the dark.
It was not Seb’s. It was a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed Shulgi itself was speaking.
“Welcome, witch.”
By Mandri’s estimation, an unaccounted-for voice weighs heavy on the scale of terror. It weighs heavier still if it comes spewing out a dark abyss, and heavier still if it comes wheezing out like the whine of a dying man. This terror weighed twice as much as he did—he could not move despite wanting desperately to flee. He watched in astonishment as Moto reached back with his torch and threw it straight down the hall, towards the voice. The flaming stick went spinning through the air, and it flew at least forty yards before it clattered onto the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop at the distant wall, a wall composed of some peculiar material that looked a bit like rough-hewn stone.
“Shalavahn,” said the voice. “They whish to shee my glory.”
Far away, two enormous braziers on either wall erupted into flame, revealing a horrifying sight—the torch hadn’t run up against against a wall, instead it’s upshot light illuminated a bloated bag of flaking skin warted over with bleeding pustules and tags of fat. It was so large that it plugged the room, with no end to it’s shapeless form in sight.
The whole horrible thing shook as as the rasping voice echoed out again. 
“Behold me, whitch! Shee my glory!”
The mound of flesh rolled forward to reveal the upper torso of a skinny old man sticking out of the top of this monstrous sack like a cork in a winebag. He was white-bearded, and shawled in a tattered green robe. On his head was a crown.
His arms clutched a woman’s body.
His jaw unhinged like a snake’s, and he began to chew on the woman’s spine.
It was Seb.
A scream of terror died stillborn in Mandri’s throat, for arrayed around this bloated beast’s belly were demon roaches the size of dogs, at least ten of them, with oily-black shells and human hands sprouting out the ends of their scorpion legs. Their faces were an unholy mix between a insect’s and a man’s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling, their mouths gulping air like fish out of water.
And there among them was a man.
A large, white-robed man dwarfed by a fold of skin.
It was Salavan, the Hrkan Governor of Meskalim, the man who’d killed Mandri all those moons ago. His black beard broke into a satisfied grin at the sight of Mandri. He patted a and at his side was pale child wrapped in black.
A Mazidariga.
By now the terror had run through its stupefying and it spurned Mandri into motion. He turned to run, but was stopped by the sight of four demon beetles climbing on the way above the exit. Before he could ask any of the Ayramun for suggestions of what to do, the Mazidariga’s tinny whistle split the air and.


They would have to fight.
“Hag beetles,” Elrahet spat. “The spines inside their shells can kill, and their shells are hard as rock.”
A rumbling laugh boomed out from the fleshy king’s stomach. “Keep your namesh to yourshelf, whitch.”
Elrahet turned to face the bloated lord. “Most putrid king,” she said, “none of us are worthy of a names, and yet a name, the good lord gives.”
The creature smiled. His teeth were black and his spit was tar. The beetle-demons clicked and clacked their, vibrating with their master’s mood.
“A name?” the foul lord mused. “A NAME!? Hhhhaaaaaahhhhh!” The laugh sent a shudder through his whole bloated body. “Poison yourselves with your names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. I and mine are more than a name can bear! LOOK at me!”
He spread his tiny arms against his girth.
Elrahet spat and said, “You have perverted your flesh, Greskal.” She pronounced his name with a scornful leer.
The creature laughed again, burping and as it did.
“Ugh-urp-ahuhhheheh… Greshkal!?… Hah!”
He leaned his bulk forwards to resettle his great stomach after the burp had disturbed it. Mandri suspected that somewhere under the ruddy and calloused flabs of skin on the floor were legs, but he doubted this demon king could do much more than lean.
“I am no longer Greshkal,” the bloated wretch said. “I have become…I have become becoming itshelf! Name me, whitch—I am Amalgamete!”
The echo of his great voice filled the hall and stunned all gathered into silence, all save the hag bettles, who chattered and clicked their teeth.
“Do you think me ugly?” Greskal said. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have split and ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from tar, living tar, for in the dim light it seemed that the lump of flesh in his grip was wriggling like a squealing piglet. He let this piglet slip, and the flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.
“This flesh is the world,” said Greskal as he caressed the welling redness. “Don’t you shee? This is the shtuff of the world into which a Spark thrown. The whiter the light of the Spark, the more this filth gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would shupplicate yourshelves before me as your god.”
Elrahet looked down her nose at Greskal and said, “Your son had a stronger stomach than you. Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.”
A paroxysmal twitch shuddered through Greskal’s body. He pointed to Elrahet and shouted, “Silence that ensnaring womb!”
A black spike shot out of a hag beetle’s body and flew at Elrahet. Moto’s sword lashed out with blinding speed and sent the spike bouncing harmlessly aside. 
Greskal grunted his annoyance. Then he said, with a disapproving stare, “You should offer yourshelves willingly. Be joined together inside my shtomach and taste union for once in your miserable livesh.”
“Oh?” said Elrahet. “You don’t want us to fight back? Does stressed meat taste fouler? Poor thing.”
Greskal grimaced. Tar pooled in his bottom lip. With the natural grace of a man made king from birth, he twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, and waved his minions onward.
“Defense first, keep them off,” Moto said to his sister. “I’ll make the killing blows.”
“I’m going to do what I need to do,” Moteah said as she threw down her pack and drew her sword.
Seb was sweating, staring at the doorway behind them that led to throne room.  There the beetle-demons were now creeping down the wall.
Purl tried to slap the terror out of his cheek.
“Wake up!”
Seb looked Purl in the eye, and said, “You insane!? We don’t have a chance!”
Purl slapped him again.
“Seb! Get hold of yourself!”
Seb spat at her feet. He took off running towards the throne room door.
It was only a ten steps distance. 
Seb made it five.
A hag bettle jumped off the wall, straight towards him. As it flew, its shell parted open, and a blur shot out of it’s back. 
Seb’s body went limp. A black spike was stuck right through his chest, through his pack, and even further—through the Riga’s swaddled head.
Mandri wanted to scream in horror, but no sound came out of his lungs. Seb fell to his knees, and then to the floor, gargling on blood and borcandi juice as he went. His killer, still clinging to him like a leech, retracted its spike back into its shell with a horrifying schlick.
Mandri pulled his sword and held it out as Moto had taught him. His arm trembled. Moto’s lessons didn’t prepare him to deal with an eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis. And there were four of them arrayed in front of him like a pack of a dogs.
“What do I do!?” he screamed at Purl.
“Just stab the damned things!”
The next thought that went through Mandri’s head was that things seem to jump faster when they’re jumping at you.
He shrieked, closed his eyes, and swung out.
He felt his blade hit the beetle’s shell.
There was a squelching crunch.
He was still alive.
The beetle demon was dead at his feet. Its back was absolutely crushed. It’s murderous spike twitched feebly on the floor, and somehow Mandri’s sword was completely bloodless.
The other three beetle-demons took to the walls and scurried hurriedly back across the hall towards Greskal, for Ayram standing in the shadow of the throne room doorway. His spear’s chisel tip was dripping black with beetle-demon blood.
“Oh,” Mandri muttered. “Thank god.”
Ayram’s face, his beard, and his shoulders were plastered in sand.
Elrahet asked, “What’s wrong?”
“Arm’s useless.”
His left arm was tucked into his robe.
“So that’s Greskal?” he asked.
“It is.”
Ayram sighed and gritted his teeth. “We don’t have time for this.”
He hoisted his spear up on his shoulder and walked towards the putrid king.
Greskal smiled at the sight. “I’ve been exshpecting you,” he said. “I have a gift eshpecially for you.”
“Not interested,” Ayram growled.
“Give me a moment. A moment, and you’ll have it.”
Greskal rolled his eyes into white and he gave his head a good shake. This seemed to knock loose some internal blockage, and his shoulders shook as his spine twinged and quivered. Then a wave rolled under his great bulk like the ocean rolling under a seaweed shore. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder. Then Greskal screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered. The wailing of his voice was run ragged by all the souls o those he had consumed.
He leaned back and another wave rippled his stomach. A boil burst open, and in its place was a cavity. Blackness oozed out of it, and when the inevitable shudder came this hole ripped wider. A taloned hand burst forth, and out of the Amalgamete’s stomach poured a great demon slathered in tar.
Half man, it stood up on two legs. Half lizard, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It was bigger than Ayram by a head and had the muscles of a prize-winning ox. Its eyes were blood red, double lidded, and its pupils were embered orange. It licked the air with a forked tongue, caught Ayram’s scent, and hissed. Then it stretched out its limbs for the first time, its arms were ribbons of muscle, it’s back a whip, it’s jaw full of hateful fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself, the coursing power, it curled it’s and seemed to know what it was meant to do—if it didn’t, all it need do to learn was to read the fear on Mandri’s face.
It growled, and the vibration sent the hag-beetles clicking and scratching their spikes against the insides their shells. They turned their dumb, lidless eyes towards the Ayramun.
“Go on, my children,” Greskal wheezed. He winced against another violent spasm that shook his whole body. Then he fainted, and the hag beetles began again to crawl.
“Get back!” Ayram shouted. “Against a wall!” He twirled his spear under his good right arm and spat a challenge towards the reptile freak. A snarl of fangs was the answer, and the demon took a step towards his prey—only one step.
The beetles, still clicking their excitement, scurried wide around both giants while Moto and Moteah herded Mandri, Elrahet, and Purl back into a corner. The hag beetles closed ranks behind Ayram, though they weren’t at all that interested in him. They kept on creeping along the hall, while some had ascended up into the darkness of the ceiling. Mandri could just make out the dull shine of their eyes as they took up positions directly above him.
Ayram took a step backwards.
Then another step.
He and the black demon lizard were at least twenty yards apart, but for the speed between them it might as well have been a single step. The thunder clap of their meeting sent unleashed chaos in the room.
So much happened so fast that Mandri couldn’t keep track.
On the floor, three beetles jumped at once—maybe it was more, he wasn’t sure because the blur of bodies and limbs was terrifying. At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. Before Mandri could flick the tip of his sword, Moto brought his blade down on that hag beetle’s back, and in a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue right behind the beetle’s head.
This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him. Though it’s head tumbled to the floor, it’s body wasn’t fully dead yet—it seized and spasmed, one of its human-handfeet slapped Mandri in the cheek. Mandri would have laughed if it weren’t for the sight of another hag beetle up on the ceiling. It dropped. Things fall faster when they’re falling at you.
This beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri’s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle’s neck and right onto Mandri’s face. The living beetle’s spike flew out of its back, but the dumb thing missed Mandri’s nose because the its eyes were on top its head. It struck out again, and missed again. Twice more, the spike tap-tapped against the stone.
“Dumb bitch!” Mandri shouted.
The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that it’s fishy eyes were staring down right at him.
“Oh, shit.”
Mandri tugged hard on the dead body between them, and as the spike flew down at his face it met instead with the dead beetle’s shell. The beast tried to pound through it like a hammer. Mandri hid himself until somehow, by the grace of Solraheen, that dumb beetle’s severed head fell right in front of his nose.
Purl pulled Mandris sword out of it and said, “Get up.”
Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles, but his hips and thighs were pinned. 
“Give me a hand,” he said.
“Really?!” said Purl. She had one good hand and wasn’t about to drop the sword.
“Kick it off me!”
Purl kicked the top beetle off him, and Mandri was able to push himself free from the other. He got to his feet, wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage—eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smushed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back along the hall. One of these ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the demon, and it was sliced in half by the lizard’s thrashing tail.
Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his spear so fast that it seemed to curved and snap suddenly straight against the lizard’s fending tail. Sparks flew, and the demon recoiled and raged and leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand, then its tail, knocking Ayram’s bar aside as the next set of talons were coming round. Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below the blow, to leave nothing but a swirl of dust between them.
Only now that they were standing still could Mandri see how much they’d ravaged eachother. The demon’s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram’s robe had been half-clawed off and ribbons of flesh hung off his side, exposing the yellow fat, the red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time that he exhaled.  
Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked Moteah’s rump.
“Help him!” the old witch shouted.
Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag-beetles easily enough, but the Newborn was an enemy beyond them.
“Go!” Elrahet screamed.
Moteah took off running towards the battle. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first.
They got halfway to Ayram when the lizard noticed their coming. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and crouched down like a cat, its long tail raised like a scorpion. Outnumbered, it slowly retreated down the hall.
“It’s scared!” said Moto as he and his sister took up positions at Ayram’s bleeding side.
Ayram spat a glob of red and said, “Careful. Don’t let it—”
The newborn jumped.
It jumped all the way up to the ceiling, then bounded off it and over the heads of the three warriors. It hit the ground running straight for Mandri, Elrahet, and Purl.
Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled horror underneath its permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift bounds. Wide-eyed, Mandri stared down his final moments with a terrified calm. Time seemed to condense, allowing him to appreciate the beauty of his killer. This demon was enormous, strong, sleek, and aside from its flapping jaw, it was perfectly symmetrical. No ugly ears. Its scaly skin glistened in the sheen of its afterbirth. Its final leap was tremendous. The sheer size could swallow him up. Curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery—it rolled under Ayram’s spear, which missed.
But the lizard’s bladed tail didn’t miss—it ripped a gash right across Ayram’s exposed stomach.
The lizard crashed into Mandri and sent him sprawling. 
When Mandri recovered, he expected to look up and see the demon hollowing out his chest.
It was on the floor, lifeless. 
Elrahet’s blade was hilted in the top of its skull.
Ayram sank to his knees. A stream of blood issued from the fissure in his stomach.
Elrahet screamed as she ran and caught the giant in her bosom.
Moteah and Moto sprinted up behind. 
“Let me see,” said Moto.
Ayram’s strength gave way and he slumped down onto the old witch’s shoulder. Moto and Moteah seized his arms before Elrahet crumbled under his weight, and they all helped him down to the ground. Elrahet gently laid his head down on the stone and wiped away the muck of battle from his brow with her thumb.
“My child,” said Elrahet. “My child…this I can not heal.”
Ayram’s great heads were clutching at his stomach. His breathing was staggered and wet. He looked at his witch, and his eyes seem filled with fright. He tried to speak—Elrahet shushed him with a finger to her lips.
“I know,” she said. “I know…I will sing your name to Solraheen, and He will know. He will know.”
Ayram’s eyes darted to Moto. He reached out with his bloody hand and his fingers found the strength to grasp Moto’s arm as tight as vice. For a brief moment, the two men beheld each other, shared an unspoken word, then Ayram’s fingers loosened and the light went out of his eyes.
He was dead.</Text>

        <Title>Pre Obo  Zooped</Title>
        <Text>There’s nothing complicated about terror. Mandri was all too familiar with its tired routine—first it startled him into stupidity, and then it spurred him into action, or petrified him, according to the flavor of the moment. There was no fighting it. When Elrahet suggested, in her witchy way, that the moment of truth was near, Mandri became terrified. He ran past that golden statue of Solraheen and made sure to kiss its hand, but that didn’t help at all.
Terror weakened his knees as he ran through the accursed temple’s bowels. He bumped his nose and toes on stone shelves and cabinet footings because he wasn’t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn’t allowed, according to Moto, because there wasn’t any time, even though Moto took time to light one up for himself. 
That’s how it goes with terror, it pushes reason aside. Moto was unreasonable, but so was Mandri. If Mandri could think clearly, he might have been able to sort through the love and hate that he had for these Ayramun.
He hated these Ayramun for leading him here. He loved these Ayramun for protecting him from the dark. He wanted to flee from them and he wanted to stay close. Moto led them into a dark dead end, and Mandri hated him. Moto led them into a windowed hall flush with fresh night air, and Mandri loved him. Seb tripped up and went sprawling down a stair, and Mandri hated her. Mandri slipped on a spot of Seb’s spit, and, well, Mandri still hated her—Seb was the sole exception to this confusing succession of emotional states which blurred together. He despised Seb, but the others he loved and hated. He hated and loved them in equal turns. And the fact that it was possible to love and hate a person in equal measure, suggested that these emotions were only crude approximations of a deeper reality which he could not articulate. It was as if there was a color portrait to be painted here but all Mandri had were pigments of black and white.
It reminded him, and this was not the time for it, but it reminded him of Solraheen, for His love was both comforting and terrifying. Yes, Mandri feared a loving Divine.
He hated Elrahet for her witchy mumblings as she scampered along in the dark, her torch bobbing right and left.
“This isn’t right,” she hissed through clenched teeth. “Isn’t right, isn’t right, isn’t right.”
Then he loved her when she took the lead and shouted, “This way!” like she knew where she was going.
Moteah yanked Mandri’s arm.
“Put your sword away, you idiot!”
Mandri didn’t even know he had it out.
“You’re going to stab me,” she said.
“I won’t.”
“You’re going to stab somebody if you don’t put it away.  Damn it Moto, why did you give him a sword?”
Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade, and good thing he did, because Elrahet suddenly took a sharp turn into another dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. 
“What are we doing?” Moteah asked with venom, begging to lead.
By this point Moto had lost his poise. “I say we wait here for Ayram! And if I say it, that’s what we’ll do!”
Moteah sneered and said, “Don’t act like you meant to run in here.”
“I was following Elrahet!”
Seb sucked in a hiss between her teeth. “So we jus’ bumblin’ around?”
They all looked to Elrahet. “My foot is sore,” she said. “I need off it.”
Moto moaned and smacked the wall in frustration. “This is why I should be in charge. Ayram put me in charge. Now, I say we need to stop and think, because stumbling through the dark isn’t doing any good. We don’t even know if the Amalgamete we seek is even in this accursed temple.”
“Why wouldn’t it be?” Moteah asked.
“Look around! There’s no one to eat.”
Mandri retreated into a dark corner of the room as the others got into an argument about the Amalgamete’s dietary habits.
Was this creature always hunting, always looking for stomachs to eat? If it had eaten all three-thousand Greskalun, did it need to stop and sleep?
Mandri wished this temple wasn’t so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. It wasn’t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps because there weren’t any fittings for candles or lamps bolted to the walls. Whoever built this place wanted it to be dark. This room had no hope of natural light—Shulgi was much too thick in the belly for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help the unrighteous lose themselves, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.
At least there was something to look at. Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around the blocky walls of this apparent dead end, and these rows were stacked upon each other from floor to ceiling. All the walls were carved up like this, and most were painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with lines of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears. There were garden scenes where Old Jandri kings strolled along in quiet contemplation. There were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of Solraheen’s dark brother, Schisol, burning martyrs who screamed as tongues of flame licked their skin.
Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that the images told. It reminded him of Hrkan tomb art—a rich man decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when he dies and the tomb’s door is sealed, no one is allowed to have a look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and then no one is looking. A monumental waste of good pigment.
No places for candles in a tomb.
No room for natural light either.
“Is this a tomb?” he whispered over his shoulder to Obo. He was surprised to find that Obo had turned around in his litter and was peering over Mandri’s shoulder at the art.
He said, “If it were a tomb, then I think there would be writing.”
“Right. But not necessarily. Image can convey the story as well.”
“If there’s a narrative here, I’m having trouble reading it.”
Mandri  agreed. He wasn’t even sure if he was reading the panels in the correct direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether? He looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight. It was hard to see, because not only was the light too dim, but it blinked every time Moto waved his frantic arms to try and express his argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene—the moment of Solraheen’s birth, when He emerged out of the Void. It was represented here by a blank face floating above a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark ripping out the stone. Each gash was as wide as two of Mandri’s own fingers.
“Uh, guys.”
The others were too engrossed in their squabble to hear him. Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.
Mandri raised his voice, “Hey!”
They all stopped bickering and stared.
“Look at this.”
Mandri pointed at the beastly gash in Solraheen’s forehead. Seb stepped over and studied the defacement with a critical eye. “It’s just scratches.”
“Let me see,” Elrahet grumbled as she waved Mandri and Seb aside with her torch. She stood on her tiptoes and stretched her leathery neck to sniff it. When she balanced back down on her heels, her wrinkled face was gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.
“It is as I feared,” she said bitterly, and she eyed those gathered with contempt, as if all this was somehow their fault. “No more mewling,” she growled, and she pushed past Moto, then trotted off into the darkness of the hallway, black robes fluttering, expecting everyone to follow. 
“What about Ayram?” Moto roared as he took off after her. Moteah and Seb quickly followed, leaving Mandri and Obo alone in the pitch black room.
Mandri fished around in his robe’s pocket for his burgeon. He wasn’t about to go running through a demon-infested temple without some way to see a demon before it jumped. The God’s Eye sight would surely reveal their Sparks and whatever lines of purpose guided them. He unstopped his burgeon’s tiny thorn-plug and shook a drop of juice onto his outstretched tongue.
His journey through the dark temple halls began anew. Elrahet led the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the scratches in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was a choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because where else would an Amalgamete dwell but in the deep? They ventured so far down into this temple mountain that it seemed to Mandri this building was upside down. A temple’s focus should be up, not down. Temples are built in high places because that puts them nearer to the heavens. There should be an ascension to the roof where the penitent could await the coming dawn. But he went down, and the further down he went, the wider the ways grew, the mustier the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. 
Elrahet led them all down a wide fan of stairs. The ceiling and walls bowed out into a black void. They stumbled into a monumental underground expanse, a throne room fit for a god. The noise of their shuffling feet and heavy breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts were closing in. It was a sea of darkness, and the Ayramun’s spot of torchlight was a dinghy set adrift. Mandri huddled close to the others, and if hadn’t felt the hard stone under his feet, and the fractal cubic pattern etched onto it, he might have lost his wits completely.
That pattern was mesmerizing—hairs of black squares lining larger squares. As he walked this pattern gave way to a procession of obsidian-studded squares. This processional was straddled on either side by enormous stone columns shaped as legs, legs whose bodies disappeared into the interminable blackness above.
Elrahet picked up speed and purpose. She led them past these columns while Mandri prayed for the God’s Eye sight to come to him, that he might see whatever winged demons must be hiding in the shadows above. But at pace, they reached the end of the hall unmolested. This end was a flat gray granite wall etched with carvings that matched the temple’s exterior—faces inside of faces, howling animals, untamed men, snarling demons, and all these faces radiated out of a central circle which ringed a red sandstone throne, a throne uplifted by of a narrow set of stairs. This throne’s seat and arms were smooth and featureless, fashioned from river-bloated stone, while its back was a billowing slab carved to look like flame licked into a curl by an unseen wind.
The throne’s seat was as empty as the rest of the temple appeared to be, which is to say it was filled with dark, malevolent purpose. Mandri felt an unease come over him at the sight of it. He felt outnumbered against the great emptiness around him.
That’s when he noticed that Seb was missing.
And the moment he noticed it, Moteah noticed it.
The whites of her eyes bulged as she counted and counted again—only four were present, only four, and she counted again as if it were possible to mess up one, two, three, four.
“Where’s…where’s Seb?!”
The question choked her throat peered into the darkness behind, hoping to catch sight of Seb—but no one was there. Nor were there footsteps. She was gone.
Moto, upon seeing their number diminished by one, drew his sword.
“Seb!” he shouted.
The old witch smacked his thigh with her cane.
“Quiet,” she shushed. “You’ll wake Schisol Himself from the dead.”
Moto set his disturbed temper upon Mandri. Suspicion skewed his brow. “Where is she?” he demanded to know.
“I have no idea,” Mandri replied, but Moto did relent.
“Did you do anything to her? Let me see your sword.”
“What?”
“Let me see it!”
Mandri fumbled at his sword’s hilt, and as he pulled it out he dropped it. The hilt and blade clanged on the stone floor, and in this cavernous hall the noise was magnified into peal of thunder.
Moto clenched his jaw tight and his eyes accused Mandri of dropping it on purpose. Then he lowered his torch over the blade and studied the sheen of light, looking for signs of use, but it was clean.
“Wait,” said Mandri, confused. “You think I stabbed Seb in the dark?”
“You or the Mazid,” he growled.
Obo climbed up in his litter to peer over Mandri’s shoulder. He tried to soothe Moto’s alarm by stating, calmly, “We didn’t do anything to the woman. In fact, I watched her scamper away from the group as soon as we entered the hall.”
“What?”
“I watched her—”
“Why didn’t you say anything?”
“I am not the woman’s Minder.”
“Where did she go?”
“That way.” Obo pointed to a perfectly square doorway opening in the wall to the right of the throne’s stairs. Moto moved towards it, but he stopped when Obo called, “I wouldn’t run so quick if I were you. There’s a foul smell coming from that hall.”
“Foul smell indeed,” said Elrahet, and she brushed past Moto to take the lead again. Mandri picked up his sword, and he followed everyone else in chasing after the witch through the square doorway. This way led to another large hall, though much smaller than the throne room. Its length disappeared into darkness, but the ceiling and walls were brushed by the light of their torches.
Elrahet had only taken twenty steps inside when she stopped cold.
She hunched over her cane and peered into the emptiness ahead. Mandri watched her aged face for some sign of fear. Her eye merely twitched. Then came a faint squelching sound that brought to mind Seb’s borcandi chewing.
“Seb!” Moto shouted out. His holler drew an angry side-long glance from Elrahet, and if that wasn’t enough to shut him up, a voice rose out of the dark.
It was not Seb’s.
It was a voice so deep and wheezing that Mandri supposed the temple itself was speaking.
“Welcome, witch.”
This unaccounted for voice rooted them all to the spot. Mandri desperately wanted to flee but somehow couldn’t. He watched on in astonishment as Moto broke the spell and reached back with his torch and threw it straight down the hall, towards the voice.
The flaming stick went spinning through the air for forty yards before it clattered onto the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop at the distant wall, a wall composed of some peculiar material that looked a bit like rough-hewn stone.
“They wish to see my glory,” said the voice. “Let them see.”
Two enormous braziers on either wall erupted into flames, illuminating what Moto’s torch could not, for the distant wall was not a stone wall, it was a colossal mound of flaking skin warted over with bleeding pustules and tags of fat, and this swell of flesh was so large that it plugged the room.
The whole horrible thing shook as the rasping voice sounded out again, “Behold, my glory!”
The mound of flesh rolled forward, and sticking out of its top, like a cork in a wine bag, was the upper body of a skinny old man, white-bearded, shawled in a shimmering green robe. On his head was a crown, and his arms clutched a woman’s headless body.
It was Seb.
This putrid king smiled in the fire’s upshot light, and this smile grew and grew until his jaw dislocated off his skull like a snake’s. He shoved Seb’s lolling head into his gaping maw, and after he stretched his cheeks beyond reason to accommodate her shoulders, he crunched down onto her spine and began to chew.
A scream of terror died stillborn in Mandri’s throat, for arrayed around this bloated beast’s belly were demon roaches the size of dogs, at least ten of them, with oily-black shells and human hands sprouting out the ends of their segmented legs. Their faces were an unholy mix between an insect’s and a man’s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling. Their mouths gulped the air like fish out of water.
Standing amongst them was a man, a white-robed man, large but dwarfed by a single fold of the bloated king’s skin. It was none other than Salavan, the Governor of Meskalim, the man who had killed Mandri all those moons ago. His white beard broke into a satisfied grin at the sight of Mandri, and he set his hand on the shoulder of a child at his side.
A pale child wrapped in black.
A Mazidariga.
The sight of the Riga spurred Mandri into motion. He turned to flee, but was stopped by the sight of four demon beetles stuck to the wall above the exit. They clicked their legs against their shells like off-the-wagon addicts.
Before Mandri could even think about being brave, the Mazidariga whistled its tinny song. At first, it was a startling trill, but it soon pitched into a mind splitting squeal. Mandri dropped to his knees. He cowered against it, and prayed a broken prayer between gasps as Obo convulsed inside his litter.
But the whistling did not last long, and as soon as it stopped, Mandri shrugged himself out of the litter’s straps and turned around to discover that Obo had gone limp.
The Mazidariga had sucked Obo’s pseudospark clean from his body.
Obo was effectively dead.
Their entire plan to kill the Amalgamete died with him.
“We’re doomed,” Mandri muttered.
No one heard him, for there were more frightening things at hand. Moto and Moteah had their swords drawn, and their eyes were set on the darkness of the ceiling above where two demon beetles crawled.
“What are those things?!” Moto cried.
“Hag beetles,” Elrahet called out, unafraid. “They’ve spines that stab out from inside their shells—careful when they open.”
“Hag beetles?” Salavan said from all the way across the room. “They are not hag beetles. They have no names. Keep your names to yourself, witch!”
Elrahet took a step towards Salavan and bowed, as if petitioning an ordinary outland court. “Steward of the most repugnant king,” she said in mocking reverence, “None are worthy of a name, yet Solraheen gifts them all the same.”
The old king’s eyes rolled back as he continued to swallow Seb whole. Salavan stood in awe below him.
“A name?” said Salavan. “Poison yourselves with your names. Chain your minds to your bodies with names. My God and His are more than any name can bear. Look at Him!”
Salavan spread his arms. The width was a tiny measure against his God’s monstrous girth. The whole mass of the beast then shivered, for up above, the king’s distended ribcage squeezed Seb’s body down into his bloated stomach. The sight of his black tongue licking down Seb’s toes was almost more than Mandri could bear, and this was followed by the crack of his jaw snapping back into place.
Elrahet watched all this with a scornful glare. “You have perverted your flesh, Greskal,” she said, heaping ridicule upon the name.
But the putrid king, this false-god, only laughed, and his laugh sent a shudder through his whole bloated body, ending in a horrible burp.
“Ugh-urp-huh-huhhh… Greskal?”
He leaned his whole bulk forward to resettle his great stomach. Mandri suspected that somewhere under the calloused flabs of skin on the floor were legs, but he doubted this demon king could do much more than lean.
“I am not Greskal…No, I am no longer Greskal…I have become…I have become, becoming itself! Name me, witch—I am Amalgamete!”
The echo of his voice filled the hall and stunned all gathered into silence, all save the hag beetles, which chattered and clicked their chitinous mouths, vibrating with their master’s mood.
“Do you think me ugly?” the Amalgamete said. He grabbed a handful of his own skin and pulled it, stretching it far beyond the point where normal skin would have ripped. It was as if his flesh was made from tar, living tar, for in the dim light it seemed to be wriggling like a piglet. He pulled it further and let it slip, and the flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.
“This flesh is the world,” the Amalgamete decreed as he caressed the welling redness. “Don’t you see? This pain of flesh is the pain of the world into which a Spark is thrown. The brighter the light of the Spark, the more this filthy flesh gloms onto it. I wear this body as proudly as my crown. These sores announce my virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, my sacrifice, you would supplicate yourselves before me as your God!”
Elrahet looked down her nose at this self-proclaimed god. “Your son had a stronger stomach than you,” she growled. “Your wife should have cut out your heart and made him king.”
A paroxysmal twitch shuddered the Amalgamete’s bulk. He pointed to Elrahet and bellowed, “Silence that Spark ensnaring womb!”
A hag beetle dropped from the ceiling.
It fell with tremendous speed, and as it did, its shell split open, revealing a black, insectoid spike which shot out and jabbed at Elrahet, but the old witch deftly stepped aside and dodged it.
The beetle crashed into the floor, and Moto’s sword lashed out and severed the spike from the beetle’s body.
The Amalgamete belched in annoyance as his wounded child scurried away. Then he issued a royal plea to all but Elrahet. “Offer yourselves willingly. Be joined together inside my stomach and know union for once in your miserable lives.”
His servant, Salavan, was quick to clarify, “Please do not struggle. Stressed meat tastes foul.”
Then, with the natural grace of a man made king from birth, the Amalgamete twirled his scrawny arm, snapped his fingers, and waved his minions onward.
Both Moto and Moteah threw down their packs and shielded Elrahet behind them. Mandri held his own sword out before him and assumed responsibility for watching their backs. He turned once more towards the exit. He suddenly regretted not paying more attention to Moto’s fighting lessons, though they might not have helped to prepare against four eight-armed, black-shelled, needle beetle from Shis arrayed above that square doorway. He would have to fight off all of them all at once.
“What do I do!?” he screamed at siblings.
“Just stab the damned things!” Moteah cried.
Mandri readied himself to stab. One of those beetles jumped right at him. As it sped through the air its shell parted open and a blur shot out of its back. 
Mandri shrieked, swung out with his sword, but it swung unbothered for his vision flashed with the white light of purpose.
The God’s Eye sight had blinded him.
“Not now!” he screamed as his vision plunged into a swirling sea of iridescent light. He cursed the burgeon’s terrible timing. He ducked to dodge the leaping beetle, he ducked low to the ground, and he prayed for Solraheen to protect him—he spoke no words, it was a stronger prayer than that, it was a burst of raw emotion. Though his plea was honest, he still expected to feel a spike pierce his neck.
When that didn’t happen, he opened his eyes and praised the wonder of being alive.
Even more astonishing was the demon beetle twitching at his feet. It lay belly-up and it had been crushed. And the God’s Eye sight was there, revealing the beetle’s bright yellow Spark lying inside its juddering stomach. Stretching out of that Spark was a single thread of bright white purpose, and that shimmering thread was drawn into an arc leading up, where it stuck to the chisel-tip head of Ayram’s iron spear.
Mandri sighed in awe at Ayram’s miraculous presence, and he flinched in fright as Ayram rammed his spear down onto the beetle’s belly.
The beetle spasmed, its Spark dimmed, and its legs twitched feebly a moment more.
The three other beetles, seeing this, scurried up to the ceiling and fled back down the hall, towards the Amalgamete.
“Thank god,” Mandri muttered, basking in radiance revealed by the burgeon, for Ayram’s Spark shone brightly, and it was woven into a web of purpose which seemed to cradle Mandri’s weary head.
Moteah rushed over to Ayram and asked, “What’s wrong?”
“Got stabbed by a Skulsi,” Ayram grumbled. “Arm’s useless.”
Indeed, Ayram’s left arm was tucked into his robe, and the manwinced as he rolled that shoulder to test it. But then Ayram caught sight of Obo, who lay limp on the floor next to Mandri. Ayram looked at each of them for an answer and found it in the Mazidariga child hugging Salavan’s leg. As Ayram put the puzzle together, his stern confidence cracked. His people were reduced to three, and he saw no hope in any of them.
But he did not see what Mandri saw.
He did not have the God’s Eye sight. He was as good as blind. He was ignorant to the fact that Elrahet’s golden Spark was as bright as the sun, and she was swarmed by threads of purpose which clouded her figure in light. Some of these threads extended out of the room in either direction, and some shot straight up through the ceiling. It was clear to Mandri that her purpose did not end inside this room.
But neither was ultimate victory certain, for she was outshone by the Amalgamete, whose Spark was a constellation of shimmering spheres of light, every size and color, and all of them were webbed together inside his bloated stomach. Mandri watched in wonder as these glowing links pulsed, merged, and split apart, while some knots popped like bubbles into sparkling rainbow dust which coalesced into new lines of purpose that stretched out into the world.
If the Amalgamete were not a god, then he was close to it, for only something divine could build new lines of purpose and set the world into motion. But if he was divine, his flesh was not a suitable vessel. He was lost in the throes of some belly-aching fit. It seemed as if the skinny king on top was about to vomit.
Down below, Salavan appeared oblivious to his foul master’s pains. He smiled at the sight of Ayram.
“Welcome!” he shouted as if greeting a long lost friend. “We’ve been expecting a big man such as you. We have gifts for all of you, if you’ll only wait a moment.”
“Not interested,” Ayram grumbled as he lofted his spear onto his good shoulder and stepped towards the evil gathered across the room.
“Yes, come,” said Salavan, beckoning. “But I won’t have that rudeness. Give the good lord a moment and he’ll give back a blessed eternity.”
The putrid king rolled his eyes back into white and he punched his body hard enough to knock loose some internal blockage. He moaned and threw his head back as his shoulders cringed and quivered. A cosmic wave rolled under his great bulk and the constellation inside his stomach rolled inside his innards. Next came a shudder, then another wave, and another shudder, and the Sparked web was pulled and stretched until a glob or red light snapped loose. When it did, the king above coiled up and screamed a scream so horrifying that even Ayram wavered.
A boil the size of a wagon wheel burst open. Blackness oozed out of this new cavity, and when the next shudder came this hole ripped wider. Out of this orifice poured a great red lizard demon slathered in tar, Sparked, it seemed, by fire.
Half woman, it stood up on two legs. Half keenkedra, it swished and flicked its razored tail. It wore the muscles of a prize-winning ox, and when it stood up to its full height, it was bigger than Ayram by a head. Its eyes, double lidded, were blood red like its scales, and its pupils reflected the fiery glow of its murderous Spark. 
The beast licked the air with a forked tongue, and it hissed as it stretched out its limbs for the first time—its arms were ribbons of muscle, its back a whip, its jaw was full of hateful fangs. As it stretched it discovered itself and delighted in its power.
It slowly turned and set its glowing eyes on Ayram. It let loose a low, purring hiss. 
In response, the hag beetles all clicked and scratched their spikes inside their shells before turning their dumb, lidless eyes back towards the Ayramun.
Then they began to crawl.
“Get out!” Ayram shouted. “Flee!” He twirled his spear under his good right arm and spat a challenge towards the newborn freak. A snarl of fangs was the reply, and the lizard demon took one step towards its prey.
The beetles, still clicking their excitement, scurried wide around both giants, while Moto and Moteah herded Mandri and Elrahet into a corner. The hag beetles closed ranks behind Ayram, though they weren’t at all interested in him. They kept on creeping along the hall, while their numbers on the ceiling swelled. Mandri could just make out the dull shine of eyes as one darted into the darkness directly above him. He couldn’t see its shape, but he knew it was there, for he could see its yellow Spark, and attached to it was a single thread of inevitable purpose which was stuck to his own poor stomach.
He tried to cut this thread with his sword, but the blade wafted right through it.
Then, he heard Ayram roar, and the distance between Ayram and the demon was closed so fast that it seemed only a single leap. The thunder clap of their meeting unleashed chaos in the room. So much happened so fast that Mandri couldn’t keep track.
Down on the floor, three beetles jumped at once—maybe it was more, Mandri wasn’t sure because the rush of bodies, limbs, and twisting threads of fate blurred all motion beyond bewilderment. At least two jumped straight at Moto, who ducked to the left, leaving Mandri suddenly exposed to one of these black clicking balls of death. And before Mandri could raise his sword, Moto pivoted and brought his own blade down on the hag beetle’s back. In a flash he cut right through the narrow gap of soft tissue behind the beetle’s head.
This dead beetle, severed head and all, plowed into Mandri and smashed him to the ground, bleeding its black blood all over him. Though its head tumbled to the floor, its body wasn’t fully dead, instead it seized up, and one of its human-handfeet slapped Mandri in the cheek.
Mandri would have laughed if it weren’t for the sight of a hag beetle up on the ceiling dropping down—things seemed to fall faster when they were falling straight at him.
The beetle crashed into its headless cousin, knocking the air out of Mandri’s chest and squeezing a jet of black ooze out of the dead beetle’s neck into Mandri’s face. But this was not enough to obscure his sight of the lines of purpose. One of these white filaments extended out from the attacking beetle’s back and ran a worrisome arc right through the center of Mandri’s forehead.
The beetle’s spike flew out of its back, and thanks to the guiding light, Mandri was able to twist his head out of the way.
The spike retracted, then struck out again, and Mandri ducked again, careful to keep his ear out of the bright white arc which mapped the spike’s path through the future.
Mandri laughed, because he felt like he was cheating, and twice more, the bumbling spike tapped against the stone next to his cheek.
“Idiot!” Mandri shouted.
The beetle stopped striking. It swiveled its whole head around so that its lidless saucer eyes were staring right down at him.
“Sorry!”
Mandri tugged hard on the dead beetle body between them, and as the spike flew down once more it met instead with the dead beetle’s shell. Mandri hid himself beneath this carapace as the beetle above tried to smash through it, and he hid like this until, by the grace of Solraheen, that dumb beetle’s head was severed and fell right in front of his nose.
Moteah pulled her sword out of it.
“Get up!” she urged.
Mandri tried to wriggle himself out from under the weight of the two dead beetles, but his hips and thighs were pinned. 
“Kick it off me!”
Moteah kicked the top beetle and Mandri was able to push himself free from the other. He got to his feet and wiped his face with his sleeve and marveled at the carnage—eight dead beetles lay strewn across the floor. One more was somehow smashed into the wall behind him. What beetles were left fled back across the hall. One of these hags ventured too near to the duel of duels that raged between Ayram and the newborn demon, and that beetle was sliced in half by the lizard’s thrashing tail.
Neither of the giants moved with anything resembling weight. Ayram swung his iron spear so fast that it seemed to curve, and it snapped suddenly straight against the lizard’s fending tail. Sparks flew, the demon recoiled and raged, then it leaped forward in a wild spin, swiping out with its taloned hand. Ayram sidestepped, and the demon followed through with its tail to knock Ayram’s spear aside just as the next spinning set of talons were coming round.
Ayram rolled backwards, ducked just below a beheading blow, and leapt away, leaving nothing but a swirl of dust between them.
Not only were their movements fraught with impressive power, but their limbs traced through swirling white arcs of purpose. It was a moving image which melted Mandri’s mind. He resolved then and there to apologize to Moto if they ever made it through this alive, as this fight was indeed a work of wondrous art, as captivating as any other, as revealing, as honest, and it had him rapt in core-collapsing wonder. And when the giants paused their brawl to gather themselves, Mandri saw how badly they’d ravaged each other. 
The demon’s lower jaw was hanging off the side of its head. Its forked tongue hung limp against its neck. Ayram’s robe was half-clawed off and ribbons of his flesh hung down his side, exposing the yellow fat, the red muscle, and three gleaming white ribs that drowned in blood every time he exhaled.  
The swirl of white light that was Elrahet bore up her cane and smacked Moteah’s rump.
“Help him!” she shouted.
Both Moteah and Moto stared down the hall. They could deal with hag beetles easily enough, but this newborn was an enemy beyond them.
“Go!” Elrahet screamed.
Moteah took off running towards the battle, her purpose clear. Moto cursed, half in acceptance of his doom, half because his sister had accepted hers first. He followed, and they got halfway towards Ayram when the demon noticed them. It gargled a hiss through its broken jaw and crouched down like a cat to retreat back down the hall. Its long tail was raised like that of a scorpion. 
Elrahet turned to Mandri and drew her golden blade. He could not see her face through the bright white shroud of purpose. Her hand trembled as it lifted the knife up above her head.
Mandri panicked. “What are you doing?!”
The old witch thrust her knife downwards in a swift stroke.
But it was not aimed at Mandri.
She brought it down upon her own bright purpose, and the golden blade, curved and gleaming, sliced right through the shimmering threads. The frayed ends splayed out into a tufted cloud, and Elrahet emerged from this mist, clad in her usual black robed, leathery self. An eye blink later, and she was completely free of all divine light, save for the light of her Spark.
It had only taken one cut—one swift cut to unwed herself from the world.
She smiled at Mandri, a gummy, toothless smile. Mandri was utterly confused as to what this could possibly mean, but there was no time to wonder, for in the distance behind Elrahet he saw the newborn demon jump all the way to the ceiling. It bounded off it, and its arc carried it over the heads of the three warriors. It hit the ground running straight for Mandri and Elrahet.
Its great chest heaved as it ran, and its open throat screamed a wild, garbled hiss underneath its permanent grin. It closed the distance in four swift strides, and its final leap was tremendous. The sheer size of it could crush them both, but curiously, it rolled in the air. The explanation for this maneuver came swiping in from the periphery—Ayram’s spear.
The demon rolled under it.
Ayram missed.
In committing himself to the blow he’d left himself open to the lizard’s scything tail, which did not miss—it ripped a gash across Ayram’s chest.
The lizard demon then crashed into Mandri and Elrahet and sent them sprawling. 
When Mandri recovered a moment later, he expected to feel the demon hollowing out his head, but the demon’s great arm lay atop him, lifeless. Elrahet’s golden blade was hilted in the top of its skull.
Mandri struggled to push himself out from under the dead demon. Elrahet was lying on the demon’s other side. Mandri’s own sword sticking out of her stomach. A chill of horror crawled through Mandri’s skin as realized he must have accidentally stabbed her in the flurry. He rushed over and tried to help, but could tell from the absence of breath that she was already dead.
A gargling gasp sounded from behind, and Mandri spun in fright. There was Ayram. Ayram and a river of blood flowing out from the fissure in his chest. Ayram gasped again and he dropped to his knees, then fell backwards. Moto, sprinting up from behind, caught the giant’s fall. Moteah was there too, though she kept on running, and when she caught sight of Elrahet dead by Mandri’s blade, she screamed a shriek of grief and hopelessness.
She huddled over Elrahet. Her shaking hands could not believe the blood which wet Elrahet’s black robes. She wiped the blood away with her own robe, then gently brushed the old witch’s hair with dewy eyed devotion.
“They come!” Moto hollered, and he lay Ayram down before turning to face the onrushing beetle horde.
“Let them come,” Moteah said as she gnashed her teeth and fought back tears. But she thought better of it when she saw her brother’s leg getting sliced by a beetle’s stabbing spine. She picked up her sword again, roared her fighting fury, and then ran to join her brother’s futile act of bravery and defiance.
Mandri stayed by Elrahet’s side. Her golden Spark was still there—his blade was stuck right through it. And there was still one thread of purpose sprouting out of it. It was thin, almost invisible, and it was tethered to Mandri.
Mandri pulled his sword out of her belly and cast it aside. Then set his lips to her wound, and he sucked her Spark into his mouth. This pure divinity sloshed atop his tongue and the taste of it filled his whole being with ecstasy. The urge to swallow was overwhelming, but that was not what he was meant to do, for a thread of purpose tethered him to Obo’s corpse, and it was shining bright.
Mandri hustled over to Obo’s lifeless body and squeezed his jaw open. He spit Elrahet’s Spark into the Mazid’s mouth. He drew back, hoping that he was done and that Obo would rise, but the Spark simply puddled in the back of Obo’s throat and did nothing.
Mandri recalled how Elrahet had muttered some guttural speech to bring Obo back after Minting rock. It was something like Old Jandri. 
He didn’t know any Old Jandri.
He didn’t know any invocations or incantations which might reweave the threads of purpose, or direct a Spark to his will. The only sacred words he knew were from that pre-meal Solitant prayer, a prayer that wasn’t life affirming, it was life denying. It claims that life is a terrifying thing. Life kills. Life kills, and it eats what it kills, and for some reason, people fear death. Yes, that is what makes life, life—it kills and eats, and it kills and it eats, and so one should not fear death, fear life! Yet the words of that prayer leapt to his mind.

Consumed by the body
	So that it can
Feed the Spark
	So that it can
Move the flesh
	So that it can be

It was a mantra which could only be completed when repeated. Mandri spoke it, and he repeated it, and as he whispered it to Elrahet’s Spark he willed it to move with his feeling as well. To his delight, a tiny thread of purpose stretched out of that Spark and wandered down Obo’s throat. It wiggled like a worm seeking sustenance. Mandri wasn’t sure whether his ritual refrain or his raw desire drew that thread into being, so he continued on doing both, and he strained with the effort. The harder he focused, and the more he lost himself in the flow of words and emotion, the further the thread traveled on. It went taut when it hit the Mazid’s stomach, and suddenly the shimmering gold Spark zipped down to take up residence in Obo’s belly.
 Obo’s whole body pulsed with light, and he awoke with a fresh face, and bright eyes, as if nothing had happened at all.
He sat up, alert as ever.
“Hello Mandri. What did I miss?”
Mandri simply pointed down the hall, where Moto and Moteah had their backs against the wall, surrounded by a gang of beetles.
“Oh,” said Obo, and as casually as the sun defeats the night, he opened his mouth and shot a golden beam of Mazidfire through the room. He swiped it in a downwards arc, and all at once, a line of twelve demon beetles were cut in half.
The Amalgamete unleashed a dreadful, squelching scream.
“AIIIEEEEEEEEEGHHhhhhghghh!”
He was not at all pleased to see Obo burn his children. And he was not at all pleased to find himself afraid. And his fear was reflected in the eyes of the white-robed Salavan, who was busy trying to squeeze his own great bulk between a fold of fat and the hallway’s wall. But he was too slow to flee—a blast of Mazidfire shot out and burned right through his skull. The young Mazidariga was dealt a similar indignity, while Obo saved the Amalgamete for last. Upon this fearsome beast, Obo let loose a powerful bolt of purging fire, but the flame merely smashed into the flesh and fizzled, leaving only a scorch mark.
Obo resummoned his fire and he held it steady. He held that beam so long that his own throat heated up to incandescence, but soon this roaring flame popped through one of the Amalgamete’s great sores and it poured into the demon king’s stomach, heating the insides, boiling them up, sending sputtering, bubbling blobs of super-heated steaming bile splashing out. Up above, a hiss of steam shot out of the putrid king’s throat. When Obo finally calmed his fire, the whole beast slumped down, deflated, and it appeared to melt into a simmering puddle of its own black bile and blood.
The Amalgamete was dead.
What beetles were still alive went scurrying into the darkness beyond. Obo was content to rub his throat and watch them leave. Meanwhile, Moteah collapsed in exhaustion, and Moto shook his head in disbelief at the dead Amalgamete.
Then he eyed Obo and snorted. He seemed as displeased to see the Obo moving as he was pleased at the sight of his boot kicking a hag beetle’s head across the floor.
“Why are you upset?” Obo asked him. “Would you prefer to have lost?”
“We have lost!” Moto shouted. “Ayram is dead! Mandri killed Elrahet!”
“So?”
“So? SO!? That witch was the last vestige of Solraheen’s grace on this earth, and she’s dead. She battled evil for untold ages, and now she’s gone. She is gone, and her enemy still lives. Who do you think will win the next battle?”
“You are referring to Schisol’s Shadow?”
“Who else?
Moto’s question went unanswered, but not because it flustered Obo. Obo was simply unconcerned.
But Mandri was concerned. He’d played too big a role in all this for it to end badly. Guilt forced him to blurt out, “Why not kill the other witch? The evil witch. We have Obo, we have his Mazidfire. Let’s find her and kill her.”
Obo said, “That sounds like a reasonable solution.”
“You can’t kill her,” Moto said. His calm delivery belied the fact that his frustration was boiling over. “No one but a god can kill a consort of the divine.”
“Then how did Mandri manage to do it?”
The tension in Moto’s shoulders snapped, and he stammered out a meek, “I have no idea.” 
Mandri snickered and gathered himself together. He picked up Obo’s litter and carried it over to the Mazid, then patted him on the shoulder. “Let me carry you for another while,” Mandri said. “Let’s go find another enemy to burn.”
Obo smiled and climbed into the litter.
“What about you two?” Mandri asked the siblings. “Are you coming?”
“Where are you going?” Moteah countered.
Mandri shrugged. “There’s got to be a  demon hole in the ground around here somewhere. I’m sure Shis can’t be far away. What else are you going to do? You’re committed to ending evil, right? Well, let’s end it.”</Text>
