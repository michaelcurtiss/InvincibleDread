        <Title>Before Injecting Body</Title>
        <Text>Seb hated the waiting that came before an ambush. The future was coming and with it came death or glory, so it was hard not to get excited and make expectations. He dreamed of death and glory. He’d been anticipating the moment for days. His expectations were built up so high that they’d gone past giddy excitement and had hardened into a sense of impending doom, such that he felt certain he was going to die. He reminded himself that he felt that way during the last ten big ambushes, and yet he came out alive. But there were Ayramun who’d been through it twenty times and died on the twenty first. It was horrible, this feeling. Having to sit with this fear for so long made it worse to be the ambusher than the ambushee. Travelers in the Sand might be expecting to encounter some gang of hard-up outland pokes, but they expected to live through it or they never would have set out in the first place. Death comes as a surprise for them, and their dread is short lived. It wouldn’t be close to what Seb went through. Those people were lucky they died so quickly.
But maybe they weren’t lucky. It might be true that the only thing that matters is what the mind is like at the exact moment of death, because when the Spark drops out of time, who knows, those last thoughts might be crystallized for all eternity. If one’s last moment is agony then it’s agony forever. For the lucky it's a deep sleep. For folks who get ambushed in the desert, if a sharpened point of iron implants itself in the forehead and scratches the right lobes, that look of shock and surprise gets fixed on the skull and it sets hard as stone. There’s not much comfort in the fact that these terrified expressions eventually get wiped away when some gummy mouthed, flat faced lizard waddles in and chews it up, because by that point the Spark is already good and gone.
If it were true, it could happen to Seb. That was a real worry. This particular ambush was feeling more risky than most. The plan to take out the Mazid and its Minder had to play out exactly as expected, or else all the Ayramun would be killed. If a Mazid were free to run amok amongst them, they would be killed no doubt. A Mazid could wipe out an entire army by itself. And even if they did take the Mazid down cleanly, there’d be the fifty-to-eighty men of unknown prowess that needed killing. If they were Hrkan Skulsi, that would be too much. 
Fifty-to-eighty Skulsi.
Maybe ninety.
There were only forty three Ayramun with fifteen arrows each. Seb’s rule of thumb was that arrows go roughly three-to-one, misses to hits—depending, of course, on the skill of the archer. He didn’t have an aptitude for numbers, but it seemed like there weren’t enough arrows. It would be close, and close was dangerous. And their arrows were a kind of shit—the tips were lizard’s teeth reinforcing a hardwood point. The shafts were a strong, close-grain wood, but that made them too stiff. A band doesn’t live long in the desert if they’re always scraping by. 
He knew he wasn’t the only one worried about it all because the rest of the Ayramun were quiet as declawed cats. Even the three lizard brothers who never stopped joking around, they were quiet. Ambushes usually weren’t an exception for them. A gold caravan could be passing right by and they’d find humor in risking everyone’s discovery by tumbling a stone down a rocky slope, or blundering a fart and then claiming later that they couldn’t help it. Even these idiots were keeping low and moving slowly, naught but skinny shadows being whipped to and fro by Moto’s whistled calls though the Junei hills. 
There was no forgiving horsing around because the rumor was that a Mazid’s eyes were as good as Moto’s rock crystal lenses, and a Mazid’s ears were as good as a spade-eared bat. That caravan was close enough now that if a Mazid truly was in their midst then his superfine senses would uncover their trap if they weren’t careful. Despite this, when their troupe came to halt in a narrow valley, Seb dared to climb up the slope and sneak a peek over the crest of the hill. He could just pick out the brownish speck of that caravan against the white of the Junei plain.
He was trying to gauge the manpower when Moto hissed a whisper at him.
“Seb! Get down!”
Seb spun around and there was Moto, staring daggers into him. Seb seethed like a lizard caught unawares, then reluctantly ducked back down into the shadow of the valley slope. Moto was the only one allowed to peek out over the hills and down into the spreading plain. He was the only one allowed because he’d said he was the only one allowed. Ayram had given him that authority and Seb couldn’t argue it. If Ayram were in charge he could maybe wheedle the privilege out of him, but there was no sense in pleading a case to Moto, so Seb slid back down the valley to take up the hiding place that he’d scouted earlier in the day
It was a decent valley, long, narrow, and steep-sided, and it bowed to the left, around a lumpy hill, which was good because the hill kept their hiding places out of sight until the last moment. Still, Seb would have preferred springing the ambush in the Junei Pass proper like they usually did. Moto insisted on doing it out in the hills on account of, ‘everyone expects to be ambushed inside the pass’. Moto insisted that the best thing to do was to mirror the caravan as they made their way across the plain, then meet them in the hills and attack while their eyes were set on the gap in the mountains.
Seb appreciated the logic of it—work against expectations, but at a certain point the best land for an ambush was the best land for an ambush, didn’t matter if they knew it was coming. People worried about ambushes in bottlenecks because bottlenecks were the best place to ambush. A valley like this was no true bottleneck. Compared to the vast expanse of the Junei plain, sure, it would do, but the slopes were nowhere near the height or steepness of a mountain shelf. The Hrks could scramble up them and maybe escape. It’d be like kicking off the top of an ant hill and all of a sudden it’s a free-for-all in all directions. They’d leave the wagons, but wagons weren’t what the Ayramun were after. And if those boys were Hrkan Skulsi, then the last thing he’d want is to do is share a slope with them.
All this was building up a frightful stress. It was even getting to Moto. The man was peering through his lenses, and his searching eye was so bugged out that he looked like he was seeing straight through the stomach of Solraheen. 
Seb was close enough to him to hear him whisper, “Shit.”
Young Papi, a scrawny, short, and excitable lad with a ratty face, was squatting nearby behind a stone. He heard Moto’s adumbration too, and he asked the man, “What is it?”
Moto said, “They’re changing routes.”
“What?” Papi squeaked.
“We need to move,” said Moto.
“They’re not coming through here?”
Moto ducked down from his hilltop sight spot and tucked his lenses back in their bag. He sat for a moment, elbows on knees, a perfect picture of contemplation, then said, “They were going to come through here, but now they’re not.”
“They changed directions?” Papi asked, eyes as wide as the moon.
Moto didn’t answer. He was back to brooding.
Papi said, “If they changed direction, then you think they know we’re here?”
“We need to move,” Moto repeated as he looked over his shoulder. “We need to hop over a few hills.”
Big Rork’s bald, blue-eyed, jug-eared head popped out from behind a boulder to share his opinion on the matter. “We can’t move now!” he said. “The Mazid will see us.”
“We can move if we’re careful,” Moto replied. He flicked his hand in the air as if Rork’s opinion were a fly. “The caravan is still a ways out.”
Rork’s upper lip curled. This wasn’t a natural facial tick, it was something he did because he thought that flashing his teeth made him look fierce. He said, sharply, “If you can see the Mazid, the Mazid can see you.”
Papi said, “We should wait for Elrahet’s smoke.”
The rest of the forty Ayramun were scattered about on either side of the narrow valley, and every one of them was staring up at three men. They couldn’t hear what was being said, but over the years they’d learned to read body language from afar. Moto was doing a decent job feigning calm, but Papi and Rork’s pained expressions told everyone everything they needed to know. 
Moto picked up his unstrung recurve bow and crawled back up the hilltop.
“Papi’s right,” Seb called after him. “We should wait for the fog to move.”
“Damn waiting for that witch!” Moto cried. “If her shits not here by now, it’s not coming. We need to move.”
“What about Ayram?” Papi asked.
“Yeah,” said Rork. “Where’s Ayram?”
“Let Ayram worry about Ayram.”
From across the valley, Skitter whistled to grab everyone’s attention. Once their gazes were in hand, she pointed up to the Hias mountains behind. There, drifting out of the dark belly of the Junei Pass, was a gray, wispy mist. It was hardly noticeable, but all the same it was there and it was pouring down into the hills, growing thicker by the moment. Elrahet’s magic was coming.
The snooty look in Moto’s eyes evaporated. He beckoned Seb up to him, and Seb scurried close. Moto whispered, “That damned fog is going to make it impossible to mirror that caravan. I’m going to get down to the plain to make sure I know exactly which path through the hills they’re taking. I’m putting you in charge until I get back.”
Seb nodded. Rork overheard and was less enthused. He left his boulder and squat-walked over. “You can’t do that,” he said. “Only Ayram can put someone in charge.”
“I don’t care who’s in charge,” Moto said scornfully. “Just don’t leave this valley. Don’t even think about it.”
There wasn’t anything in Moto’s words for Rork to argue with, though the wild look in his eyes and the veins spidering out of his shaven skull said he was trying to find it. Rork was a man who was always defending his place in the pecking order. The list of men who could give him short shrift was, itself, short—there was Ayram of course, and then barely Moto. No women. Moteah could probably take him if she wanted to try, but Rork would never admit it. He had a hard enough time admitting that he’d lose a brawl to Ayram. He’d have to be dead sober, and even then it’d be all, ‘you never know’, and ‘if things happened like so-and-so’, and ‘if I were proper mad I could kill anything’.
Rork’s hateful eye chased Moto as the man scuttled down the valley slope. At the bottom Moto dusted off his burnt orange robes and then did a glancing head count to make sure all the Ayramun were where they needed to be. He broke his own law of silence by saying out loud, “Alright, you idiots—sit tight, I’ll be back soon.” Then he turned around and disappeared around the valley bend. He was gone in less time than it took Seb to fish another borcandi spine out his sleeve.
Seb was chewing through his spines at a prodigious rate. Moto leaving only made the stress worse. It was never good for discipline when a leader leaves the group, even a much begrudged deputy leader like Moto. Without a man to lead Seb knew it was only a matter of time before someone got a bright idea that needed taming. Seb figured Rork would be the first to act up, because that’s just who he was. When Rork rambled back down to his boulder he was muttering insults and curses at no one in particular.
“Loosen up, Rork”, said Forty. Forty was an older woman with a rascal’s disposition. She playfully twanged her bow at Rork—a mocking shot at his self-importance. Rork sized up this affront with a puffed-out chest, and said, “Big show. Biiiiig show. But you better be careful, Shorty, ‘cause anything can happen in an ambush. With this mist rolling in, I might not know which way I’m shooting.”
“Same goes for me,” said Forty, tongue only half-in-cheek.
“Pipe down, Sol’s sake,” said Seb.
Forty gave Rork one final fleer, then the two marched apart and settled down to watch Elrahet’s mist bleed out of the mountains. 
The humidity had already reached them—Seb could smell the pleasant musk of moistened earth. And up in the mountains, the mist was no longer merely a mist, congealing as it was into ropes of fog, fog magic’d with purpose, spooling out into slender smoky tendrils that slithered down into the hills like snakes. Some of them twirled up into the darkening sky and there the wind caught them, lifted them higher, brushing out the finer threads. A low, rolling drum of distant thunder echoed out from somewhere deep inside the mountains.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” Papi said. Seb agreed. This was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of belly magic. It was, perhaps, too good. If he could see it, then no doubt a Mazid could see it too. What a Mazid would make of it, he could only guess, and just as it was all starting to coalesce into something resembling a natural, smooth fog, a misty fissure snapped into the sky over the mountain peaks, and from it a herd of storm clouds emerged. They crept out slowly, hesitantly, like cautious cattle out of the pen, but once they were out they began to billow as they fed on the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of Elrahet’s den.
Two fingers later and these storm clouds were blotting out the sun. Their gray shadows drooped down over the Ayramun’s valley, and not long after that the drifting fog mantled the nearest hill and fell upon them. Visibility dropped so low that Seb’s near-sightedness was no longer an impairment, for no one else could see further than he. They all watched the valley bend even though it was out of sight, for they all expected that at any moment, Moto would come jogging back to get them moving again.
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, little pricklings on the skin, a light peppering of the sandy rock and clay. This didn’t last long, for the raindrops swelled and in half-a-hand they were no longer prickling but plunking. 
“A bit much, isn’t it?” Papi said as he sheltered his bow with his short brown cape. “Don’t she know I can’t shoot no good in the rain?”
“It’ll stop soon,” Seb said.
But it didn’t.
The rain dribbled off the rocks and stony clay, and where there were depressions and scars in the earth the rain was pitter-pattering puddles into being. These puddles grew into boot-swelling pools that overflowed their banks, and streams poured down the valley slopes, following the run of furrows that ancient rains had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millennia. Seb figured it was more water in one short span than this stretch of desert had seen in twenty decades. It brought out the lizards—or rather pushed them out. A little gray bonbon popped out of the clay right next to Seb’s boot. Its swiveling eye looked mightily confused by the sudden downpour. It was so flustered that it didn’t have time to notice Seb’s heel coming down on it’s head. 
Seb looked over to young Papi. The boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers.
“Might as well be swimming,” he said. “Damn this goddamn rain!”
The curse was hardly out his lips when a gnarled flash of white lightning split through the iron mist above.

CRACK-BOOM!

A chorus of startled yelps echoed out from the Ayramun.
Papi looked like he’d shat himself. “Elrahet’s never conjured more than a mist!” he squealed.
Tizm, a gray-scruffed old-timer stationed across the valley grumbled out, “That old witch is gonna get us killed!”
“Where’s Moto?” came another ragged voice out of the rain.
“Screw that,” said another. “Where’s Ayram?”
From there the Ayramun began to bicker. The specific charges and insults being thrown across the valley weren’t anything new, but the stress and fear had so softened everyone up that the simplest ‘eat my shit’ cut deep. If it weren’t for the rain dampening their fighting spirit, there might have been a brawl.
Seb didn’t begrudge them their bellyaches. They’d been fed a raw meal. None of them were prepared for this kind of weather. The ground under his butt was getting slick and muddy, and if it rained any harder it would be difficult to shoot a bow because the wetter his bowstring got, the more it lost its spring. And there was no telling what a pounding rain would do to an arrow’s flight because Seb had never shot in such conditions. He knew enough to know that it wouldn’t help. For an ambush where everything had to go right, this was downright bad.
Seb began to brood and boil, but he caught himself in the act—he was torturing himself with expectations.
He needed to recenter himself.
Things weren’t bad. They weren’t good, either, but they weren’t bad.
This kind of thinking, this breaking the world into ‘good’ and ‘bad’, this was a symptom of expectations.
The truth was that everything was happening exactly as it was supposed to happen.
Seb closed his eyes and thumbed a short chain of prayer beads that he kept stashed in his robe, and as he did, he chanted a prayer to try and repress his simmering frustration.
	
	A well without water
		is filled with purpose,
	An arrow in the dirt
		has hit its mark,
	There is no mystery
		below the surface,
	There is no self
		above the Spark.

He repeated this five, ten times as he drew his shoulders in against the rain. This plunking rain. This purpose-driven rain. The fog, the bickering, these were purposeful too—to what end, Seb wasn’t sure, but now that he was looking for purpose he could sense a great deal of it, and perhaps it was brewing something terrible. The Ayramun were about to intersect with destiny—no—that was wrong to say, for destiny is ever-present. They were always intersecting with it. There were no bit-part players here. Poor and ragged as they may seem, these Ayramun were people, and all peoples are descendants of the first man and first woman, each soggy, grumpy face was the culmination of a hundred thousand generations of toil, as many generations as the Hrkan Lords themselves, and so each were as important, as godlike, for if but one of them was missing then events would not unfold as they were meant to. 
But he shouldn’t privilege the living. If the rock under his feet did not exist then he would not be sitting here, he would be sitting somewhere else, and thus the future, bounded by lines of immanence extending from the present, would wind a different weave. Yes, this very rock was sacred, as all things are sacred, as the dead lizard under his boot was sacred. All things are filled with the Spark’s sacred power.
“Seb! Quit your fartin’ about!”
“What!?”
The call had come from Rork. He and a few other miserable looking louts were down on the valley floor, straddling either side of a trickling stream that was building up in the middle of the valley’s run. Seb was about to chastise them for doing Sol-knows-what when he noticed that Moto had returned and was standing in their midst. Seb leapt to his feet and filtered down the valley slope with the rest of the Ayramun. 
Down in the valley’s belly, Moto face was alight with an excitement that no one shared.
“What’s wrong with you people?” he asked. “We’re about to bag us a Mazid and you look mad about it.”
Tizm, the old bent-backed wonder, kicked at the swelling stream and pointed to the sky and shouted, “The old witch has overcooked it!”
A refrain of agreement rained down. A few shushed, then others shushed back. Moto tried to calm them all with plaintive hands, saying, “People. Please.”
“Please my ass!” said Tizm. “This rain is gonna ruin everything!”
“The rain is perfect,” said Moto. “It’s got the Hrks hunkered down in a valley finger.”
“The Hrks?” asked Papi.
“Yes,” said Moto with a wary grin. “It’s Hrks we’re hunting. Hrkan Skulsi.”
The admission that it was Skulsi, not Blackwood caravan men, sent a wave of discontent rippling through the gathered Ayramun. Moto tried to stem the unease by lying. Seb knew it was a lie because when Moto was working through a big lie he’d smile and whine at the same damn time, like people’s doubting faces were annoying to him. “They’ve gone and lined themselves up against a wall for us,” he said. “Jumping them will be the easiest thing in the world, but we’ve got to hurry.”
Someone on the outer edge of the huddle blurted out, “What’s this about Hrks?”
Moto raised his voice above the rain. “The Minder and his Mazid didn’t come with a Blackwood caravan. They came with a Hrkan guard.”
Another round of shouting broke out, followed by another round of shushing and counter-shushing. Moto again tried to calm those gathered with nothing but his frantic hands. In the end he resorted to a sharp whistle, which shut everyone right up.
Moto said, “The fact that it’s Hrks doesn’t change a damned thing.”
Rork’s bald head stuck up above the huddle like a veiny, boiled egg floating in a stew. He spoke up and said, “All the better! I’d rather kill a Hrk than a Jandri man!” 
Moto nodded and said, “They’re bedded down like rabbits in a long, straight ravine.”
“The one with all the karkle bushes?” Seb asked.
“They’ve all got karkle bushes in them,” said Moto.
“The valley we’re standing in don’t.”
“It doesn’t matter,” said Moto. “All we have to do is sneak up and shoot some Hrks. It’ll be the easiest thing in the world. I know it’s raining hard, but I’m not asking you to feather an eye at ten-score yards. With this rain and fog we can get up close. You won’t miss. You can throw stones at them if you want to. You can stuff mud down their throats if you want to.”
“Where’s Ayram?” asked another.
 A quivering frustration flashed in Moto’s face and he shot a beseeching look to the heavens before saying, “This is happening whether Ayram’s here or not. Whether you like it or not. And it’s happening now, before this rain and fog let up. Let’s get moving!”
He turned and pushed his way past a few Ayramun and set off back towards the bend. After the briefest hesitation, Big Rork marched after him, and at his encouragement, everyone else followed. Together they were a small, sad herd of outland folk, a jumble of soggy wool and tired feet slapping the mud aside the building stream.
Seb kept to the back as they eventually climbed up and out of the valley and then crossed over a few others. They tramped through a flooding basin, and all the while Seb eyed the rainy mist with unease, for he could feel providence at work in that mist. Unlike the providence that people pray for and expect, this providence was providing something undesired, Seb was sure of that. Destructidence is what it was. Deathidence. There wasn’t an established word for it, which itself was a telling sign of the plundering spirit of the age. People only cared about their relationship to Solraheen’s plan so long as they were getting something good out of it. These Ayramun were no different.
Eventually Gugi found his way to Seb at the back of the wandering troupe. The skinny man’s face was agog with fear. He clearly wanted to talk, so Seb indulged him.
“Whaddya want?” Seb asked.
“Ya know where we headed, right?”
“I do.”
“It’s that cursed ravine, the one where I found those bones!”
“I know.”
“You should say somethin’ to the others.”
“Why not you?”
“I don’t ever say shit so no one’s gonna listen to me.”
“They won’t listen to me either.”
“They would. I would. That ravine is cursed, and people are gonna die if we get down in it.”
“I thought you said if we moved that body out of that ravine, then the curse would be moved out with it?”
“What do I know about curses? I was just sayin’ shit. For all I know that curse is what brought this storm and lured them Hrks down in it.”
Seb said, “Are you tryin’ to get out of payin’ me my spines?”
Gugi spat a wad of borcandi juice right where Seb was stepping, clearly upset that Seb could think about debts in a time like this. Before he could voice that concern, a muted horse’s whinny was heard through the splashing rain. Everyone instinctively crouched down and rushed to the shelter of a sloping mound. They were still a few-score yards away from the ravine where the Hrks were sheltering. Nothing of those troops could be seen through the mist.
Moto raced back down the line of Ayramun to crouch down next to Seb and Gugi. Voice low, he asked, “You two scouted this ravine, right?”
Gugi and Seb both nodded.
“Anything we should know about it?”
Gugi was quick to respond. “It’s cursed and we shouldn’t be here.”
“Cursed? What do you mean, cursed?”
Seb said, “This be the ravine where we found those bones.”
Moto snorted, almost laughed, then said, “I need to know the lay of the land. I can’t see through this damned mist so I don’t know if there’s an easy out for them up on the eastern side.”
“Moto,” said Gugi, leaning into his words, “I’m tellin’ you, this place is cursed. It’s gonna get us killed.”
“So what? If it’s cursed for us, it’s cursed for them too. Doubly so for them, cause they’re sitting in it.”
“Yeah, but we the ones who found the bones! We the ones that been warned! Not them. Us! Me!”
Moto gave up on Gugi and turned to Seb. “Is there any way in and out of that long stretch that might make it easy for them?”
Seb shook his head. “That stretch is mostly steep. There is one little nook on the other side that’s kinda like a stair but that’s it.” 
“How wide?”
“Not that wide.”
Moto paused to think, then said, “I want you two to go back a ways, and cross to the other side of the ravine where it’s safe. Then work your way back down the other side and then set up where that stair is.”
“Just us two?” Gugi asked.
Moto turned and motioned towards his sister, Moteah, who was not at all enthused to be at her brother’s beck and call. Like Moto, she carried herself with an air of authority, though she was even more arrogant about it than her upfront brother.
Moto looked her square in the eyes, “Get Rork and twelve others to follow Seb and Gugi. You’re going to set up on the other side of the ravine, and we’re going to try and push the Hrks towards you. So be quick and be ready. There won’t be a whistle. When they come, they come.” 
Moteah snuck away, gathered up Rork and the nearest twelve Ayramun, then brought them to Seb and Gugi. Gugi wasn’t about to take charge, so Seb crowned himself and led them all back towards the mountains, keeping the course of the cursed ravine a small-score yards away to his right. When he felt they’d gone far enough, he led them sliding down into the steep ravine, and then they had a tough, nervy scramble back up the other side. Once up they headed back towards the plain, keeping low and quiet.
Seb knew the place he was looking for, but with the rain and mist there was no way he’d find the spot until he was already upon it. The fog was so thick that he kept second guessing whether he was even following the right ravine. Nonetheless he kept going, one foot in front of the other, trying not to think too much about the fight that was only fingers away. Soon, he was confronted with the sound of snorting wagon ponies drinking their fill of rainwater.
He crouched down, and the rest Ayramun behind did likewise. He ambled over to the edge of the ravine and slithered up against a big, solid boulder that leaned over the ravine’s lip. From there he could hear horse hooves stamping in the ravine’s stream. If a horse was that close, then a Hrk might be closer. He didn’t want to peek over the boulder to get the lay of the scene, but when he heard the clank of wood on wood he couldn’t help himself. He steeled his nerves and peered over the boulder.
Right below him were two horses still hitched to an tarp-covered wagon, and behind them were two more horses and another covered wagon, and whatever was behind them was lost to the mist. There was only one man. He was a natural Hrk, so far as Seb could tell, a natural Hrk with redblack hair and a full black beard that made his head seem massive. Clad in sopping wet browns, he was darting to and fro amongst the wagons, prepping them against the rain with all the urgency of a man who knew the curse that water puts on a wagon that’s been drawing dry. He was driving himself insane as he scampered through the rain and fumbled with the wheel tents that were ready-tied to the sides of the wagon bed. He snapped one down and slapped the sideboards twice with an open hand, and this loosed a latch which pinned the tailgate, and when that swung open, a dead body dropped rolled out of the bed and plopped down into the mud.
It was a dead Jandri boy in a white tunic.
Seb turned to his troupe behind him. The confusion on his face must have been easy to read because Rork grumbled and invited himself up to Seb’s rock. The man kept his vein-strapped head tucked against the rock’s hump as he peered out around it.
Upon seeing the wagons and the lonesome wagonmaster, and the dead body, Rork’s confusion surpassed Seb’s. His bulging eyes searched for some sign of the rest of the enemy, but found none.
“Shit.”
Moteah joined the two men at the boulder and quietly stole a look for herself. Her usually uptight expression didn’t show the slightest hint of concern.
“What do they got a corpsecart for?” Rork asked her in a whisper.
“Why would I know?” Moteah said.
“Your brother’s the one who went scouting.”
“Do I look like Moto to you?”
“Yeah, you do,” said Rork. “If he sprouted tits I couldn’t tell you two apart.”
Moteah’s brow tightened even further. It wasn’t anger. She called it ‘severe disinterest’. It was one of her two expressions, the other being plain old disinterest. Problem was, that look wasn’t a good way to deal with a man like Rork. The best thing to do was to pretend not to notice him, even ignore him altogether. Unfortunately for Moteah, she was too good looking to get away with that either. To a man like Rork, her wrinkled brow was nothing but shirred meat, and he rest of her nothing but meat wrapped up in a woman’s robe.
“Bitch is leadin’ us into a trap,” he whispered to the others.
“I’m not leading anyone anywhere. Seb is.”
Seb felt the eyes of both these schemers bear down upon him. 
“Don’t lookit me,” he whispered back. “I didn’t set this up.”
They were still looking at him.
Seb pointed east, in the direction of the Junei Plain, and whispered, “There’s a overhang in the ravine down a ways. It could do as a cave. It could be that the Hrks have taken it up.” 
“Seb, you’re a soilbucket.” Rork’s voice was uncomfortably loud. “This is a goddamned trap if I ever seen one. I bet my three uglies they know we’re here.” 
Rork turned to the iron mist from whence they’d came, and he cast his suspicious eye about, as if the dark boulders lurking in the haze were really Hrkan Skulsi in disguise. He unwrapped his bow from its cow-leather strap and strung it with an easy flick. The rest of the Ayramun caught on to his excitement, and they strung their bows in kind. Then all thirteen of them, Gugi included, crept up to join Seb, Moteah, and Rork at the lip of the ravine. When their fists were full of arrows, Rork decided that the time was right to strike. He gave his bow a pull to test the string, and then he stood up and loosed an arrow at the unaware Hrkan wagonmaster.
The arrow didn’t have far to go. Almost as soon as the fletching was free from Rork’s fingers the arrowhead was planting itself into the back of that Hrkan neck. The man clutched and gurgled, then fell to his knees and splashed down face-first into the budding rainwater stream. His head was buried full in the running water, and downstream one of the horses whinnied and stamped when it found its drink suddenly awash with blood.
Rork ducked back behind the boulder and gave Seb a contented grin, like he’d just won the battle all by himself. Then they waited. Moto had said there wouldn’t be a whistle, so they had to wait for the battle straight. It was unbearable. They waited for at least a full finger, and by then the rain started to let up and the sound of the ravine’s running water was louder than the plunks which poured from the sky.
Rork made to climb down into the ravine.
Seb caught the hem of his robe and pulled him back.
“What are you doing?” Seb rasped.
“There’s no one here,” Rork sneered.
“Moto said we should wait!”
Rork stretched his arms out to gesture at all the nothingness down in the ravine. He said, “Wait for what?”
“A signal.”
“Signal to do what? What are we ambushing, horses?”
One of the Ayramun, a young one named Ritt, popped his head up and said, “There’s Hrks down there somewhere, I feel it.”
“Quiet down!” Moteah snipped.
Much to Moteah’s dismay, and Seb’s amazement, Rork stood straight up and put his finger and his thumb to his lips and whistled out a three-chirp alarm—bright and sharp. The sound cut through the falling sheet of misty rain as easily as if it weren’t there at all. The horse’s ears swiveled as they regarded Rork with some confusion.
Before anyone could do anything, Rork scrambled down to the bottom of the ravine, arrow knocked, and waited for something to happen. When nothing did, he growled a curse and shot an arrow into the back of the already dead Hrk. 
“I’m not stayin’ here no longer,” he said.
With that, Rork marched across the ravine and tossed his bow up onto the other side and started to climb out.
Moteah swept up in Seb’s periphery and shot an arrow right at him.
In clean dry air a gull-feather arrow with a whistling nock would trill with excitement when released, but soggy as it was, Moteah’s arrow flew across the ravine with nary a whine. Rork had no idea what hit him, and it hit him in the back, right inside the left shoulder blade and continued on through the heart. He fell backwards, back into the ravine, and he was limp dead before he hit the ground.
Seb gasped. It was against the rules to even scratch one of their own, even a throbbing cock like Rork. Killing an Ayramun was a privilege reserved for Ayram.
Before Seb could get out a word, Moteah grabbed him by the breast of his robe and yanked him down behind the boulder. He twisted her hand off him and held it firm in his wiry grip.
“What’d ya kill him for!?”
Moteah put her finger to her lips and shushed him. Seb grimaced then spat the whole borcandi blob that had been stewing in his cheek. He spat it right at Moteah’s face, but quick as a cat, Moteah ducked out of its terrifying arc and the wad landed with a splat on Gugi’s chest. Gugi squealed in disgust as he flicked the gooey gunk away. Moteah clapped his mouth shut with her free hand and her eyes flared caution at both men. She pointed with her chin to the opposite bank and mouthed a silent warning—Hrks.
Seb let go of her wrist and peered around the boulder. There across the ravine were two shawled figures wandering out of the mist. At first he took them for Ayramun, but the first of them made a foreign gesture towards the other, and when Seb saw a flash of white under one of their ruddy cloaks he knew for sure—these were Hrkan men.
The two figures paused, cocked their heads towards Seb like they’d felt his thoughts ripple the fog between them, and they dropped down flat against the ground.
Seb ducked fast behind his boulder. He turned to Moteah and had to restrain himself from shouting. 
“They know!” he whispered.
The sound was hardly out his mouth when from behind them, on their own cozy side of the ravine, a Hrkan horn of war thrilled the air.
BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommmm
Hrkan battle horns are deep and drooping bleats that tremble the bones of even the most well armored lizards, and Seb was clad in nothing but rags. When the horn blast jumped up behind him it startled him out of his skin. He yelped and swore and swiveled around to face the terror, and there, deep in the fog, running right towards him, was a blurry host of men, Hrkan Skulsi, white coats flashing bright under their brown disguises. Maybe twenty or more of them.
They moved in silence, a leggy, white speckled blob, all business, just jogging right up like they were lost and about to ask for the way to the road. They didn’t try to intimidate with screams and yells, for in truth they were killers, not soldiers. The power of the Mazidai had long made armies obsolete, so the kind of professional fighting man that the Hrkan world breeds is one who lusts for the frenzy of small skirmishes where the pain of death is anesthetized in glory, and man proves himself against man.
The horn bleated again.
BWEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooommmm
The Skulsi blob began to sprint. 
Seb felt a strange warmth running down his thigh and he realized that he’d pissed himself. Moteah loosed an arrow at the running blob and before she saw the results, she took off sprinting west, back up along the ravine and towards the mountains. Seb took off after her, and the rest of the Ayramun followed. They trimmed the ravine, pursued by that mob of Hrks, while on the opposite bank those two Hkran cloaks had somehow multiplied into twenty. They shadowed the Ayramun, silent like the others, and they bunched up against the ravine as they waited for the terrain to present an opportunity to close the gap and kill. Seb nocked an arrow midstride and shot it across, but it flew harmlessly into the mist. Others had more luck—Gugi put an arrow through the leading man’s leg, and the man behind him was struck down when an arrow rammed into the side of his skull. The two figures crumpled to the ground and those behind bumbled over them, but this did little to allay the chase. 
Then Moteah jumped down into the ravine.
Seb wondered what insanity could have possessed her to give those Hrkan Skulsi a leaping chance, when in the next instant, a thin, golden beam of Mazidfire came ripping right by his ear.
The line of this blazing beam shot out in the misty distance. Seb ducked low and avoided its swipe, but the men behind him weren’t so lucky. The fire ran right through the back of Gugi’s head and burst out of his eye-socket as if his brains and bone weren’t there. As his body slumped down, the stripe of fire burned a slit into his skull, and then the fireline’s distant fulcrum swiveled and the beam of death swiped a downwards arc through the air, cutting four Ayramun into uneven halves as the fire smashed into the earth, sizzling the soggy clay as it went.
As suddenly as it came, the Mazidfire was gone. Somewhere in the misty distance, the unseen Mazid had closed its mouth, and what was left of that golden beam ran roaring into earth, leaving in its wake charred flesh, black glass, glowing stone, and smoke.
All those still alive threw themselves down the ravine’s steep slope. Seb bumped into a karkle bush on the way down and rolled uncontrolled to the bottom where he flopped belly-first onto the muddy ground and slid with a splash into the ravine’s nascent stream. The rest of the Ayramun were already scrambling to their feet and fleeing along after Moteah. Seb stayed put, for there in front of his eyes was the very bush he’d seen that morning, the bush from under which he’d pulled those accursed bones. Its black twigs bloomed above him like a monument to fate. His mind was unpinned by the significance of it, and he felt that awesome humbling chill which only comes when one catches a glimpse of the divine plan.
He tried to reel himself back in by telling himself this bush was just a bush—no more or less a major player in the divine plan as the mud squishing against his stomach, or even Ayram himself. Yes, this bush was just a bush.
And yet…
And yet he was supposed to crawl up under that bush and so he did. He crawled up under it, and he lay himself down, right down where those bones had been, and he watched through the brambles as the Hrks descended upon his straggling companions.
Ten of the leaping Hrks were shot down by arrows before their feet landed in the ravine, leading to a lopsided melee in favor of the Ayramun. Yet the Skulsi, undaunted, charged on. Their feet flung mud as their powerful strides closed the distance as fast as drag-backed lizards. Seb cowered under the bush lest the obligations of battle came to him. His gut turned at the sight of one man sticking his boot on the back of another’s head, suffocating him in the mud. This cruelty was paid in turn with a knife stuck through his gut. 
By then, the Hrks that ran along ravine’s right lip caught up, but they did not join the fray. The continued on to chase what quarry had escaped.
The battle below them raged.
Swords and knives clanged and sparked. Mud-caked fists buried themselves into eye sockets and sharp elbows cracked against ribs. Deeds were done which which warranted songs, for the bravery and fight, in both Hrk and Ayramun alike, was tremendous. In the end, all that was left was a smattering of corpses and two mud-grumbled men, both wounded and breathing hard with blades held out before them. Neither made a move as both were content to catch their breath.
The rain had stopped. The ravines stream was trickling. Seb felt the itch of purpose stirring in his stomach. Perhaps the bush had reserved him for this very moment, for here was an opportunity for decisive action, and that was all anyone could ever ask for, clarity of cause and effect—the outcome of a skirmish turned with him. Seb twisted out from under his bush to fire an arrow at the man he took to be a Hrk, but just as he did, two figures stepped up to the lip of the ravine above him. The shorter one opened its mouth and a golden beam of Mazidfire burst out. It cut both combatants in two.
Seb froze in fear at the sight of the Mazid and its Minder. He hustled back under the bush.
He had never seen a Mazid before, and he couldn’t see much of it now. It was shorter than its Minder by a good foot, the height of youth, and it was skinny, and its misshapen frame was wrapped up in black robes and a black cowl like a penitent priest. Seb couldn’t see the eyes, only the general gauntness of its face, which was white as sea foam, like the creature had been dipped in cream. Its chin was smooth and hairless as an egg, and its brows were shaven. The Minder was a normal Jandri man, dressed in the standard scribal robes—rich blue with a blue hooded cape that mantled his broad shoulders like a pelt.
Another man joined the two figures up on that bank. Unlike the others, he was a natural born Hrk through and through—blackred hair, greying around the temples, with copper skin and eyebrows so thick they could flog lizardskin. His dark cloak was held together by a silver sunrose brooch—the mark of military command. This man marched up to the much shorter Mazid bearing a look of such contempt that it seemed to Seb that he was about strike the creature, but he merely pointed to the dead men down in the ravine and shouted, “Explain yourself!”
The Mazid said meekly, “I don’t know what you mean.”
“You killed one of my men!”
“I didn’t know which was which.”
“So you killed both?!” The commander turned to the Mazid’s Minder and said, “I don’t know how you people breed these things, but something’s wrong. Each one is dumber than the last.”
The Minder said, “You preach to the choir, captain. You’ve only had to deal with it for a week, whereas I am bonded to it.”
He pulled his handless left arm out of his robes as if to prove the fact.
“Well get a better grip on it!” the captain shouted.
“I’ve tried. But the Lords are married to their methods. They say they’re balancing intelligence with docility, but then they bind me to this Mazid, which is neither intelligent nor amenable to instruction, and when I complain they tell me to bear it like a man, and move on. So bear it, captain—those are not my words, but theirs.”
The Skulsi captain looked like he was about to strangle them both.
The Mazid, caught like a child between quarreling parents, bowed its head respectfully and said, “I’m sorry.”
The Minder tsked his annoyance. “What use does the captain have for an apology? Tell me, what can he do with it?”
“He can—”
“That was a rhetorical question.”
In the Minder’s good hand was a short rod of wood wrapped in braided leather. He held it up to the captain and said, “You may hit it if you like. It won’t hurt the creature. It doesn’t feel pain, but I find it works out my frustrations nonetheless.”
The Captain took the rod firm in hand.
“Avoid the head and neck,” said the Minder.
The captain swung the rod and brought it down hard on the Mazid’s shoulder socket. The whole arm sunk down and went limp, clearly dislocated, and it looked brutal, but Seb winced more than the Mazid did.
The Captain stepped back to appreciate the bludgeoning, then said, “They don’t make Mazidai like they used to.”
“They don’t.”
“It’s a wonder the Lords make use of these things at all,” said the captain. “They’ve long outlived their usefulness. We Skulsi can handle these outlaws on our own.”
The scribal Minder was miffed by this remark. “Captain,” he said, “the only reason you are dealing with outlaws at all is because the outland tribes are too whipped by the Mazidai to become anything more than outlaws. Get rid of me and my kind, and you might find yourself on the front line of a real battle.”
“What do you mean, a real battle?”
“I meant no disrespect.”
“It sounded like disrespect.”
“I assure you, I meant no disrespect.”
The captain glared at the Minder, then said, “We don’t have time for this. We’ve work to do.”
“No,” said the Minder as he drew his lips tight. “I won’t have a captain of the Skulsi brewing discontent behind my back. If you’ve something foul towards me brewing in your stomach, then let’s have out with it.”
The old captain glowered and said, “Remember that you are here to make things easier for me, not the other way around. And I’d say that killing my men outright is a violation of that mission. Worthy of censure! If you were not a Minder I would have had you burned out for incompetency.”
The Minder was unimpressed. “Yes, if I were not a Minder you could do all manner of things. But fantasies are the domain of children and beggars, not soldiers who stand up straight. White light, we speak of the decline of the Mazidai, but if you are Hrkan Skulsi then I worry doubly for the Lordship.”
“You have a problem with me?”
“Look at you—pomped up like you deserve something better than what you’ve gotten, like you don’t understand that I can speak to you how I want. Worry about yourself, captain, lest that self-important stomach growl too loudly forget the station of its Spark.”
“You’d threaten a captain of the Skulsi!?”
“I would. You should be stricter with your moods, given how easily I could end you.”
The captain smirked, put his hands on his hips, and eyed the Minder with amusement. He said, “I doubt you have the control. Just the other day one of my men saw your Mazid let an outland poke run free. It could have easily burned the man down, but it didn’t.”
The Minder looked upon his Mazid with some confusion and asked it, “Is that true?”
“Yes,” said the Mazid meekly. “The man posed no imminent threat.”
“Did I tell you to spare our quarry if it posed no imminent threat?”
“No.”
“Did I give any order that could be construed as a grant of mercy to any of these outland pokes?”
“No.”
“Then tell me, why did you not burn him down?”
The Mazid gave no answer.
“That was not a rhetorical question,” the Minder said.
“I guess…I’m not sure”
“You’re not sure!?” the Minder exclaimed, as if the utterance was not possible.
“Hah!” laughed the captain. “You see? You’ve barely got a hold of that thing.”
“Oh, shut up.”
“Wait until Lord Gagan hears about this. He’ll have you out in the pastures where you belong, minding sheep not Mazidai.”
The Minder countenanced the captain’s threat with a grim nod. Seb could feel the captain’s smugness even from underneath his karkle bush. 
Then the Minder said to the Mazid, “Obo, kill that man.”
The Mazid’s throat glowed gold and an eyeblink later its mouth was alight with the fire of gods. A thin beam shot out, and a heartbeat later the captain crumpled to the ground—in the place where his forehead used to be was a black and smoldering hole. What was left of his face was fixed in hurtled surprise.
The Minder grunted in satisfaction, then he looked down on his Mazid with contempt and said, “Don’t you ever think about what you want or don’t want. You don’t have wants. Get creative with my orders again and I’ll have us both sent back to the guild for—”
His words were interrupted by the sight of the Mazid shuffling towards the ravine’s lip. Despite its apparent frailty, its movements were deliberate and precise. It then began to climb down into the ravine, leaving its Minder in a state of shock.
“What are you doing?” the Minder spat, but the Mazid did not answer. It had reached the ravine’s belly and was walking towards Seb’s bush. It was close enough now that Seb could see its gaunt visage clearly—a ghoul of a person, with gray, empty, Sparkless eyes.
“Stop!” the Minder commanded with a shout. His word shook the Mazid’s spine. The Mazid paused, struggled a step, then continued on as if laden with chains.
The Minder stretched out his handless arm, his stubby wrist wrapped in white cotton, and he pointed it at the Mazid and yanked it back, screaming, “STOP!”
The shout was so strong it had form and purpose, for it punched the simpering rain, exploding the droplets out to drape a bubble of dry air which enveloped himself, the Mazid, and Seb. The command wrenched Seb’s own Spark in his stomach at the sound of it. It struck the Mazid with force, as every single muscle in its body snapped taut, and the sad creature titled, limbs-bent, frozen and unbalanced, and when the bubble of rain collapsed down on it, it fell over, stiff as stone. The slight creature splashed onto the muddy ground with all the jarring heft of a tossed blanket.
Its unsettling gray eyes remained unnervingly alert. They swiveled in their sockets and found Seb inside his bush, and Seb lay transfixed. He had looked every manner of creature in the eye in his long journeys through the Sand, and in each of them he’d found some sort of kinship—not so when he beheld the pale, bald, browless, lashless, grey-eyed Mazid.
His fixation on this creature was broken when the Minder stomped down into the belly of the ravine. This short climb put him out of breath. He stood over the Mazid and gave it a probing kick. Then he cursed his own luck, picked the stiff creature up, put it upon on his shoulder, and began to walk away.
The Minder’s back was turned.
Seb slithered out of his bush, drew his knife, and matched the Minder’s footfalls. He closed the distance until he could no longer contain his excitement, and he screamed such a deep and wild scream that it surprised even himself. The Minder dropped the Mazid in fright. Seb’s knife was upon him before he could spin around, and it followed him down to the ground with a flurry of blows. The Minder rolled around in the sticky mud and tried to scramble free, tried to wrestle himself free, but he had only had the one good hand. He raised his stumped forearm to shield his face, but Seb’s knife was there, and it was there again in the ribs, and there in the stomach, and in the neck, then severing two tendons in his flailing arm. Seb jabbed at the man’s throat, and did not let up until his knife slipped out of his hand from the glut of blood.
The Minder was dead.
Seb looked towards the Mazid, and it had gone limp. Even its eyes were stilled, for it was no longer bound to any will. 
The Mazid was as light as the bag of bones he’d carried earlier that day. Seb carried the creature over to the karkle bush because he didn’t know what else to do with it. There was no divine sign here for him to read.
The rest of the Ayramun might be dead, or it could be that Skulsi would come wandering back at any moment.
He hid. He hid underneath that karkle bush with that limp Mazid, and for the first time in his entire sober life he was living completely in the moment.
The gods were all dead, but here he was, champion of the Junei Hills.</Text>

    <Snapshot Date="2024-05-22 17:38:02 -0400">
        <Title>Before Ejecting Mandri</Title>
        <Text>Seb hated the waiting that came before an ambush. She couldn’t sit still for the excitement, but she was forced to sit still because she wasn’t allowed to move unless Moto whistled at her. There was nothing to do but let her imagination run wild. Unfortunately, hers was a black imagination. It did not take long for her giddy excitement to molt into a sense of impending doom. She felt certain she was going to die this day.
She reminded herself that she’d always come out alive.
That didn’t help.
There were other Ayramun who’d been through a hundred battles and died on the hundred-and-first. Like Wicky. Wicky was unlucky. She took a sling-stone to the forehead. That rock scratched her brain and fixed a look of rigid surprise onto her skull. Poor Wicky still looked like that when Seb buried her, and she still looked like that when a pack of gummy mouthed, flat faced lizards dug her up and ate her. That’s when Seb began to believe that a person’s last thought gets crystallized for all eternity. If someone died surprised, then they’d stay surprised forever. And Seb knew that she could end up unlucky like Wicky. The gods might have thought to leave spine-sipping Seb out of the future back when they were weaving it.
This particular ambush was feeling more risky than most. The plan to take out the Hrkan Lord and capture his Mazid had to play out exactly as expected, or else all the Ayramun would be killed. If the Mazid got loose, Seb would be killed. Without a doubt, killed. A Mazid could wipe out an entire army by itself. And even if the Ayramun did take the Mazid down cleanly, there’d be fifty to eighty men of unknown prowess that needed killing. If they were Hrkan Skulsi, that would be too much. 
Fifty-to-eighty men.
Maybe ninety.
There were only forty three Ayramun with something like fifteen arrows each. Seb’s rule of thumb was that arrows go roughly three-to-one, misses to hits—depending, of course, on the skill of the archer. She didn’t have an aptitude for numbers, but it seemed like there weren’t enough arrows. It would be close, and close was dangerous. And their arrows were kind of shit—the tips were lizard’s teeth reinforcing a hardwood point. The shafts were a strong, close-grain wood, but that made them too stiff. Bandits don’t live long in the desert if they’re always scraping by, and when they’re scraping by with lizard’s teeth they tend to die quite quickly. 
Seb knew she wasn’t the only one worried about it all because the rest of the Ayramun were as quiet as declawed cats. Even the three lizard brothers, the jokesters, they were quiet. Ambushes usually weren’t an exception for them. A gold caravan could be passing right by and they’d find fun in risking discovery by blundering a fart and then claiming later that they couldn’t help it. Even those idiots were keeping low and still, naught but skinny shadows bending only at Moto’s whistled commands. Indeed, all the Ayramun were silent as they laid wait in the rocky Junei hills.
The rumor was that a Mazid’s eyes were as good as a vulture’s, and a its ears were as good as a spade-eared bat. That caravan was close enough now that if a Mazid truly was in their midst then its superfine senses would uncover their trap if they weren’t careful. Despite this, Seb dared to climb up the slope of their chosen valley and sneak a peek over the crest of the hill. There, she could just pick out the brownish speck of that caravan against the blurry white of the Junei plain.
She was trying to gauge the manpower when Moto hissed a whisper at her.
“Are you cracked!?”
Seb spun around and there was Moto, staring daggers into her. Seb seethed like a lizard caught unawares, then reluctantly ducked back down into the shadow of the valley slope. Moto was the only one allowed to peek out over the hills and down into the spreading plain. He was the only one allowed because he’d said he was the only one allowed. Ayram had given him that authority. Seb couldn’t argue with it. If Ayram were here she could have wheedled the privilege out of him, but there was no sense in pleading a case to Moto. So, she slid back down the valley to take up the hiding place that she’d scouted that morning.
The valley itself was long and narrow, steep-sided, and to the left it bowed around a lumpy hill, which was good because that hill would block their quarry’s view of this stretch until the last moment. Still, Seb would have preferred springing the ambush in the Junei Pass proper like they usually did. Moto insisted on doing it out in the hills on account of, ‘everyone expects to be ambushed inside the pass’. Moto insisted that the best thing to do was to mirror the caravan as they made their way across the plain, then meet them in the hills and attack while the Mazid’s eyes were set on the gap in the mountains.
Seb appreciated the logic of it—it worked against expectations, but at a certain point the best land for an ambush was the best land for an ambush, surprise be damned. People worried about ambushes in bottlenecks because bottlenecks were the best place to ambush. A valley like this was no true bottleneck. Compared to the vast expanse of the Junei plain, sure, it would do, but the slopes were nowhere near the height or steepness of a mountain shelf. The Hrks could scramble up and over them and maybe escape. It’d be like kicking off the top off an ant hill and all of a sudden it’s a mad scramble in all directions. Sure, they’d leave their wagons, but wagons weren’t what the Ayramun were after. And if those boys were Hrkan Skulsi, then the last thing Seb wanted to do was share a slope with them.
All this was building up a frightful stress. It was even getting to Moto. The man was lying flat, peering over the hill, and his searching eye was so bugged out that he looked like he was seeing straight through the stomach of Solraheen. 
Seb was close enough to him to hear him whisper, “Curse my Zosan Spark.”
Young Papi, a scrawny, short, and excitable lad with a ratty face, was squatting nearby behind a stone. He heard Moto’s adumbration, and he asked the man, “What is it?”
“They’re changing routes,” Moto answered.
“They’re what!?” Papi squeaked.
“We need to move.”
“They’re not coming through here?”
Moto pulled back from his hilltop sight-spot. He sat for a moment, elbows on knees, a perfect picture of contemplation, then said, “Well they were going to come through here, but now they’re not.”
“They changed directions?” Papi asked, eyes as wide as the moon.
Moto ignored Papi and went back to brooding. But Papi, proud as he was, refused to be ignored. “If they changed direction,” he said, “then you think they know we’re here?”
“We need to move,” Moto repeated as he looked back over his shoulder, as if he could see the caravan through the mound of rock. “We need to hop over a few hills.”
Big Rork’s bald, blue-eyed, jug-eared head popped out from behind a boulder to share his opinion on the matter. “We can’t move now!” he shouted. “The Mazid will see us!”
“We can move if we’re careful,” Moto replied. He flicked his hand in the air as if Rork’s opinion were a fly. “The caravan is still a ways out.”
Rork’s upper lip curled. It wasn’t a natural facial tick, it was something he did because he thought that flashing his teeth made him look fierce. “If you can see the Mazid,” he said, “then the Mazid can see you.”
Papi added, “We should wait for Elrahet’s smoke.”
The rest of the forty Ayramun were scattered about on either side of the narrow valley, and every one of them was staring up at Moto, Rork, and Papi. None of them except Seb could hear what was being said, but over the years they’d all learned to read body language from afar. Moto was doing a decent job feigning calm, but Papi and Rork’s pained expressions told everyone everything they needed to know. 
Moto picked up his unstrung recurve bow and crawled back up the hilltop.
“Papi’s right,” Seb called after him. “We should wait for Elrahet’s fog afore we move.”
“Damn waiting for that witch!” Moto cried. “If her fog’s not here by now, it’s not coming. We need to move.”
“What about Ayram?” Papi asked.
“Yeah,” said Rork. “Where’s Ayram?”
“Let Ayram worry about Ayram.”
From across the valley, Skitter whistled to grab everyone’s attention, and as soon as all eyes were in hand, she pointed up to the Hias mountains to the east. There, drifting out of the dark belly of the Junei Pass, was a gray, wispy mist. It was hardly noticeable, but all the same it was there and it was drifting down into the hills, growing thicker by the moment. Elrahet’s magic was coming.
The snooty look in Moto’s eyes evaporated. He beckoned Seb up to him, and Seb scurried close. Moto whispered, “That damned fog is going to make it impossible to mirror that caravan. I’m going to get down to the plain to make sure I know exactly which path through the hills they’re taking. I’m putting you in charge until I get back.”
Seb nodded. Rork overheard and was less enthused. He left his boulder and squat-walked over. “You can’t put Seb in charge,” he said. “Only Ayram can put someone in charge.”
“I don’t care who’s in charge,” Moto said scornfully. “Just don’t leave this valley. Don’t even think about it.”
There wasn’t anything in Moto’s words for Rork to argue with, though the wild look in his eyes and the bulging veins that webbed his shaven skull refused to settle down. Rork was a man who was always defending his place in the pecking order. The list of men who could give him short shrift was, itself, short—there was Ayram of course, and then barely Moto. No women. Moteah could probably take him if she were allowed a sword, but Rork would never admit it. He had a hard enough time admitting that he’d lose a brawl to Ayram. He’d have to be dead sober, and even then it’d be all, ‘you never know’, and ‘if things happened like so-and-so’, and ‘if I were mad real proper then I could beat Schisol Himself’.
Rork’s hateful eye chased Moto as the man scuttled down the valley slope. At the bottom, Moto dusted off his burnt orange robes and then did a glancing head count to make sure all the Ayramun were where they were supposed to be. He then broke his own law of silence by saying out loud, “Alright, you idiots—sit tight, I’ll be back soon.” Then he turned and ran, disappearing around the hill that slumped into the valley bend. He was gone in less time than it took Seb to fish another borcandi spine out from her sleeve.
She was chewing through her spines at a prodigious rate. Moto’s leaving only made the stress worse. It was never good for discipline when a leader leaves the group, even a much begrudged second-in-command like Moto. With no clear head in charge, it was only a matter of time before someone got a bright idea that needed taming. Seb figured Rork would be the first to act up, because that’s just who he was. She watched him as he rambled back down to his chosen boulder, muttering insults and curses at no one in particular.
“Loosen up, Rork”, said Forty. Forty was an older woman with a rascal’s disposition. She playfully twanged her bow at Rork—a mocking shot at his self-importance. Rork sized up this affront with a puffed-out chest.
“Big show,” he said. “Biiiiig show. But you better be careful, Shorty, ‘cause anything can happen in an ambush. With this mist rolling in, I might not know which way I’m shooting.”
“Same goes for me,” said Forty, tongue only half-in-cheek.
“Pipe down,” Seb urged. “Sol’s sake.”
Forty gave Rork one final fleer, then the two marched apart and settled down to watch Elrahet’s mist bleed out of the mountains. 
The humidity had already reached them, as Seb could smell the pleasant musk of moistened earth. And up in the mountains, the mist was no longer merely a vapor, congealing as it was into a fog driven with purpose. It spooled out into slender tendrils that slithered down into the hills. Some of these ropes of fog twirled up into the darkening sky, and there the wind caught them, lifted them higher, and splayed them out like fingers. 
A low, rolling drum of distant thunder echoed out from somewhere deep inside the mountains.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” said Papi. Seb agreed. This was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of blood magic. It was, perhaps, too good. Seb knew that if she could see it, then no doubt a Mazid could see it as well. She began to worry that this odd weather might cause their quarry to draw alarm. She prayed that Elrahet would have the good sense to calm it down and make it look natural. Then a misty fissure snapped into the sky over the mountain peaks, and from its magic’d depths there emerged a herd of storm clouds. They crept out slowly, hesitantly, like cautious cattle out of the pen. As soon as they were out into the open air they began to billow as they fed on the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of Elrahet’s sacrificial lizard.
Two fingers later and these storm clouds had blotted the sun. Their gray shadows spilled down into the valleys, and not long after that, the drifting fog mantled the hill behind Seb and fell upon her. Visibility dropped so low that Seb’s near-sightedness was no longer an impairment, for no one else could see much further. She and the rest of the Ayramun watched the obscured valley bend which led out west, for they all expected that at any moment Moto would come jogging back to get them moving again.
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, little pricklings on the skin, a light peppering of the sandy rock and clay. Soon the raindrops swelled, and in half-a-hand they were plunking gobs of wet. 
“A bit much, isn’t it?” Papi said as he sheltered his beloved bow with his short brown cape. “Don’t she know I can’t shoot no good in the rain?”
“It’ll stop soon,” Rork assured.
But it didn’t.
The rain dribbled off the rocks and stony clay, and where there were depressions and scars in the earth the rain drew up puddles into being. These puddles grew into boot-swelling pools that overflowed their banks, and streams poured down the valley slopes, following the run of furrows that ancient rains had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millennia. Seb figured this was more water in one short span than this stretch of desert had seen in twenty years. It brought out the lizards—or rather pushed them out. A little gray bonbon popped out of the clay right next to Seb’s boot. Its swiveling eye looked mightily confused by the sudden downpour. It was so flustered that it didn’t have time to notice Seb’s heel coming down on its head. 
Seb looked over to young Papi. The boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers.
“Might as well be swimming!” the boy shouted through the pitter-pattering din. “Damn this goddamn rain!”
The curse was hardly out his lips when a gnarled flash of white lightning split through the iron mist above.

CRACK-BOOM!

A chorus of startled yelps echoed out from the Ayramun.
Papi looked like he’d shat himself.
“Elrahet’s never conjured more than a mist!”, he squealed.
Tizm, a gray-scruffed old-timer stationed across the valley grumbled out, “That old bitch is gonna get us killed!”
“Where’s Moto?” came another ragged voice out of the rain.
“Screw that,” said another. “Where’s Ayram?”
From there, the Ayramun began to bicker. The specific charges and insults being thrown across the valley weren’t anything new, but the stress and fear had softened everyone up so that the simplest ‘eat my shit’ cut deep. If it weren’t for the rain dampening their fighting spirit, there might have been a brawl.
Seb didn’t begrudge them their bellyaches. They’d been fed a raw meal. None of them were prepared for this kind of weather. The ground under her own butt was slick and muddy, and if it rained any harder it would be difficult to shoot a bow because the wetter her bowstring got, the more it lost its spring. And there was no telling what a pounding rain would do to an arrow’s flight because Seb had never shot in such conditions. She knew enough to know that it wouldn’t help. And this was an ambush where everything had to go right.
She began to brood, but thankfully caught herself in the act before getting to worked up.
There was no need to torture herself by moping over unrealized expectations.
Things weren’t bad.
They weren’t good, either, but they weren’t bad.
That kind of thinking, that breaking the world into ‘good’ and ‘bad’, that was a symptom of expectations. The truth was that everything was happening exactly as it was supposed to happen.
She closed her eyes and thumbed a short chain of bone beads that she kept stashed in her robe for just these moments. As she counted them, she chanted a prayer to try and repress her simmering frustration.
	
	A well without water
		is filled with purpose,
	An arrow in the dirt
		has hit its mark,
	There is no difference
		below the surface,
	There is no self
		above the Spark.

She repeated this five times, and five times more as she drew her shoulders in against the rain.
Now that she was looking for purpose she could sense a great deal of it. Some great destiny was unfolding here, and there were no bit-part players. The Ayramun may be poor and ragged, but each grumpy face was as much a child of the first woman as any king. They were all links in a chain forged by a hundred thousand generations of toil, and they were here. If just one of them were missing then events would not proceed as they were meant to. Same went for the rest of the world. If the rock under her feet did not exist then she would not be crouching here, she would be crouching somewhere else, and thus the future would lay in a different weave. Yes, this very rock was sacred. All things were sacred. The dead lizard under her boot was sacred. All of it was bounded by lines of immanence that stretch back to the mind of a long dead god.
“Seb! Quit your fartin’ about!”
“What!?”
The call had come from Rork. He and a few other miserable looking louts were down on the valley floor, straddling either side of a nascent stream that was building up in the middle of the valley’s run. Seb was about to chastise them for doing Sol-knows-what when she noticed that Moto had returned and was standing in their midst.
Seb leapt to her feet and filtered down the valley slope with the rest of the Ayramun. 
Down in the valley’s belly, Moto’s face was alight with an excitement that no one shared.
“What’s wrong with you people?” he asked. “We’re about to bag us a Mazid and you look mad about it.”
Tizm, the bent-backed wonder, kicked at the swelling stream, then pointed to the sky and shouted, “The old bitch has overcooked it!”
A refrain of agreement rained down. A few voices shushed. Others shushed back. Moto tried to calm them all with plaintive hands, saying, “People. Please.”
“Please my ass!” said Tizm. “This rain will ruin it!”
“The rain is perfect,” said Moto. “It’s got the Hrks hunkered down in a valley finger.”
“The Hrks?” asked Papi.
“Yes,” said Moto with a wary grin. “It’s Hrks we’re hunting. Hrkan Skulsi.”
The admission that it was Skulsi, not Blackwood caravan men, sent a wave of discontent rippling through the gathered Ayramun. Moto tried to stem the unease by lying. Seb knew it was a lie because when Moto was working through a big lie he’d smile and whine at the same damn time, like people’s doubting faces were annoying to him. “They’ve gone and lined themselves up against a wall for us,” he said. “Jumping them will be the easiest thing in the world, but we’ve got to hurry.”
Someone on the outer edge of the huddle blurted out, “What’s this about Hrks?”
Moto raised his voice above the rain. “The Minder and his Mazid didn’t come with a Blackwood caravan. They came with a Hrkan guard.”
Another round of bickering broke out, punctuated by a flustered shout, “They know we’re here! They’re ambushin’ us!”. Then came another round of shushing and counter-shushing. Moto tried again to calm those gathered with his frantic hands. In the end he resorted to a sharp whistle, which shut everyone right up.
“The fact that it’s Hrks doesn’t change a damned thing,” he said sharply.
Rork’s bald head stuck up above the huddle like a veiny, boiled egg bobbing in a hairy stew. “All the better it’s Skulsi!”, he shouted. “I’d rather kill a Hrk than a Jandri man!” 
Moto nodded and said, “They’re bedded down like rabbits in a long, straight ravine.”
“The one with all the karkle bushes?” Seb asked.
“They’ve all got karkle bushes in them,” Moto replied.
“The valley we’re standing in don’t.”
“Look, all we have to do is sneak up and shoot some Hrks. It’ll be the easiest thing in the world. I know it’s raining hard, but I’m not asking you to feather an eye at ten-score yards. With this fog we can get up close. You won’t miss. You can throw stones at them if you want to. You can stuff sand down their throats if you want to.”
“Where’s Ayram?” asked another.
 Frustration flashed across Moto’s face and he shot a beseeching look to the heavens. “This is happening whether Ayram’s here or not. Whether you like it or not. And it’s happening now, before this rain and fog let up. Now let’s get moving!”
He turned and pushed his way past a few Ayramun and set off back towards the bend. After the briefest hesitation, Rork marched after him, and at his encouragement, everyone else followed. Together they were a small, sad herd of outland pokes, a jumble of soggy wool-wrapped bodies and tired feet slapping the mud beside the building stream.
Seb kept to the back as they climbed out of the valley and crossed over a few others. They tramped through a flooding basin, and all the while Seb eyed the rainy mist with unease. She could feel providence at work in that mist. Unlike the providence that people pray for and expect, this providence was providing something undesired. Destructidence is what it was. Deathidence. There wasn’t any real word for it, which itself was a telling sign of the decadent spirit of the age. It showed that people only cared about the gods so long as the gods were giving back something good. These Ayramun were no different.
Eventually Gugi found his way to Seb at the back of the wandering troupe. The skinny man’s face was agog with fear.
“Whaddya want?” Seb asked.
“Ya know where we headed, right?”
“Sure enough.”
“It’s that cursed ravine, the one where I found those bones!”
“What of it?”
“You should say somethin’ to the others.”
“Why not you?”
“I don’t ever say shit so no one’s gonna listen to me.”
“They won’t listen to me either.”
“They would,” Gugi pleaded. “I would. That ravine is cursed, and pokes are gonna die if they get down in it.”
“I thought you said if we moved those bones out, then the curse would be moved out with it?”
“What do I know ‘bout curses? I was just sayin’ shit. For all I know that curse is what brought this storm and lured them Hrks down in it.”
“Are you tryin’ to get out of payin’ me my spines?” Seb asked accusingly.
Gugi spat a wad of borcandi juice right where Seb was stepping. He was clearly upset that Seb could think about petty debts in a time like this. Before Seb could press him over it, a muted horse’s whinny was heard through the splashing rain. The whole group crouched down and rushed to the shelter of the nearest sloping mound. They were still a few-score yards away from the ravine where the Hrks were sheltering. The ravine itself could not be seen through the mist.
Moto raced back down the line of Ayramun to crouch down next to Seb and Gugi. He lowered his voice to a whisper. “You two scouted this ravine, right?”
Gugi and Seb both nodded.
“Anything we should know about it?”
“It’s cursed,” Gugi blurted out. “We shouldn’t be here.”
“Cursed? What do you mean, cursed?”
Seb answered quickly, “This the ravine that had those bones.”
“Screw those bones,” Moto snorted. “I need to know the lay of the land. I can’t see through this damned mist so I don’t know if there’s an easy out for them up on the northern side.”
“Moto,” Gugi said firmly, leaning into his words, “I’m tellin’ you, this place is cursed. It’s gonna get us killed.”
“If that ravine is cursed for us, then it’s cursed for them, too. Doubly so for them, as they’re sitting in it.”
“But we the ones that been warned!” Gugi cried. “Hrks didn’t find no bones! I did! Me!”
Moto gave up on Gugi and turned to Seb. “Is there any way in and out of that ravine that might make it easy for them?”
Seb shook her head. “That stretch is mostly steep. There’s a little throat on the other side that’s kinda like a stair but that’s it.” 
“How wide is that stair?”
“Not that wide. But…maybe it’s wide enough.”
Moto thought for a moment, then whistled for his sister, Moteah. Moteah was already nearby, and she was not happy to be at her brother’s beck and call. She was maybe half Moto’s age, not a girl but barely a woman, and despite that, she carried herself with the same air of authority that Moto did. Her self-serious brow bowed for no one save the sun. She was the only one who could get away with defying her brother, so Moto made sure to give his next command a little extra aggressiveness. “Get Rork and twelve others to follow Seb and Gugi. They’ll lead you round to the other side of the ravine.” He pointed behind Moteah’s shoulder, ostensibly pointing to ravine’s opposite bank, but with the fog and rain he might have well been pointing at the moon. “The rest of us are going to hit the Hrks from this side,” He said, as if it were no big deal. “If any Skulsi take off running, they’re going to be headed towards you. So be quick and be ready. There won’t be a whistle. You’ll know they’re coming when they come.” 
Moteah snuck away and gathered up Rork and the nearest twelve Ayramun. She brought this jumble of expectant looks to Seb and Gugi. Seb crowned herself lead navigator and began to led them all back the way they’d came, towards the mountains, keeping the course of the cursed ravine a few-score yards away to her right. When she felt they’d gone far enough, she led them sliding down into the steep ravine, and then they had a nervy scramble back up the other side. Once up, they headed back towards the plain, keeping low and quiet.
Seb knew the place she was looking for, but with the rain and mist there was no way she’d find the spot until she was already upon it. The fog was so thick that she kept second guessing whether she was even following the right ravine. Nonetheless she kept going, one foot in front of the other, trying not to think too much about the fight that was a finger away. Soon, she was confronted with the sound of snorting wagon ponies drinking their fill of rainwater.
She crouched down, and the Ayramun behind did likewise. She ambled over to the edge of the ravine and slithered up against a big, solid boulder that leaned over the ravine’s lip. From there she could hear horse hooves stamping in the ravine’s stream. If a horse was that close, then a Hrk might be closer. When she heard the clank of wood on wood she couldn’t help herself from peeking, so she steeled her nerves and peered over the boulder.
Right below her was a horse still hitched to a wagon whose bed was covered by a canvas stretched taught above the boards. Behind this wagon was another horse and another covered wagon, and whatever was behind that was lost to the mist. There was only one man. He was a natural Hrk, so far as Seb could tell, a natural Hrk with redblack hair and a full black beard that made his head seem massive. Clad in sopping wet browns, he was darting between the wagons, prepping them against the rain with all the urgency of a fellow who knew the curse that water puts on a wagon that’s been drawing dry. He drove himself insane as he scampered through the rain and fumbled with the little canvas tents that were ready-tied just above each wagon wheel. He snapped one of these sheets over a wheel-hub, and in his rush to get to another he slipped and bumped against the wagon’s boards, and this juddering loosed the latch which pinned the tailgate. The tailgate popped open, and the wagon pooped out a dead body which plopped into the mud.
It was a dead Jandri boy in a white tunic.
Seb turned to her troupe behind her. The confusion on her face must have been easy to read because Rork grumbled and invited himself up to Seb’s rock. The man kept his vein-strapped head tucked against the rock’s hump as he peered out around it.
Rork’s jaw dropped upon seeing the wagons and the lonesome wagonmaster, as well the dead body. His bulging eyes searched for some sign of the actual enemy, but found none.
“Whore’s breath,” he muttered.
Moteah joined Rork and Seb at the boulder and quietly stole a look for herself. Her usually uptight expression didn’t show the slightest hint of concern.
“What are they hauling dead bodies for?” Rork asked her in a whisper.
“Why would I know?” Moteah answered.
“Cause your brother’s the one who went scouting.”
“Do I look like Moto to you?”
“Yeah, you do,” said Rork. “If’n he sprouted tits I couldn’t tell you two apart.”
Moteah’s brow tightened even further. This wasn’t anger. Moteah called it ‘severe disinterest’. It was one of her two expressions, the other being plain old disinterest. Problem was, that look wasn’t a good way to deal with a man like Rork. The best thing to do was to pretend not to notice him, even ignore him altogether. Unfortunately for Moteah, she was too young and fresh to get away with that either. To a man like Rork, her wrinkled brow was nothing but shirred meat, and the rest of her was an annoying robe.
“Bitch is leadin’ us into a trap,” he whispered to the others.
“I’m not leading anyone anywhere. Seb is.”
Seb felt the eyes of both these schemers bear down upon her. 
“Don’t lookit me,” she whispered back. “I didn’t set this up.”
They were still looking at her.
Seb pointed east, in the direction of the Junei Plain. “There’s a overhang in the ravine down a ways. It could do as a cave. It could be that the Hrks have taken it up.” 
“Seb, you’re a soilbucket.” Rork’s voice was uncomfortably loud. “This is a goddamned trap if I ever seen one. I bet my uglies they know we’re here.” 
Rork faced the cloud of mist from which they’d come, and he cast his suspicious eye about, as if the dark boulders lurking in the haze were really Hrkan Skulsi in disguise. He unwrapped his tall bow from its cow-leather strap and strung it with an easy flick. The rest of the Ayramun caught on to his excitement, and they strung their bows in kind. Then all thirteen of them, Gugi included, crept up to join Seb, Moteah, and Rork at the lip of the ravine. When their fists were full of arrows, Rork decided that the time was right to strike. He gave his bow a pull to test the string, and then he stood up and loosed an arrow at the unaware wagonmaster.
The arrow didn’t have far to go. Almost as soon as the fletching was free from Rork’s fingers the arrowhead was implanting itself into the back of that Hrkan neck. The man clutched and gurgled, then fell to his knees and splashed down face-first into the budding rainwater stream. Downstream, one of the horses whinnied and stamped when it found its drink suddenly awash with blood.
Rork ducked back behind the boulder and gave Seb a contented grin, like he’d just won the battle all by himself. Then they waited. Moto had said there wouldn’t be a whistle, so they had to wait for the battle straight. They waited for at least a full finger, and by then the rain started to let up and the sound of the ravine’s running water was louder than the plunks which poured from the sky.
Having had enough of waiting, Rork made to climb down into the ravine.
Seb caught the hem of his robe and pulled him back.
“What are you doing?” Seb rasped.
“There’s no one here,” Rork sneered.
“Moto said wait!”
Rork stretched his arms out to gesture at all the nothingness around them. “Wait for what?”
“A signal.”
“Signal to do what? What are we ambushing, horses?”
One of the Ayramun, a young one named Ritt, popped his head up. “There’s Hrks down there somewhere, I feel it.”
“Quiet down!” Moteah snipped.
But much to Moteah’s dismay, and Seb’s amazement, Rork stood straight up and put his finger and his thumb to his lips and whistled out a three-chirp alarm—bright and sharp. The sound cut through the falling mist of rain as easily as if it weren’t there at all. The horse’s ears swiveled as they regarded Rork with some confusion, and before anyone could stop him, Rork scrambled down to the bottom of the ravine, arrow knocked. When his feet slapped onto flat ground, he crouched and waited for something to happen, and when nothing did, he growled a curse and shot an arrow into the back of the already dead Hrk. 
“I’m not stayin’ here no longer,” he said.
With that, Rork marched across the ravine and tossed his bow up onto the other side and started to climb out.
Moteah swept up in Seb’s periphery and shot an arrow right at him.
In clean dry air a gull-feather arrow with a whistling nock would trill with excitement when released, but soggy as it was, Moteah’s arrow flew across the ravine with nary a whine. Rork had no idea what hit him, and it hit him right between the blades, and it burrowed deep to nick the heart. He fell backwards, back into the ravine, and he was limp dead before he even hit the ground.
Seb gasped. It was against the rules to even scratch one of their own, even a throbbing cock like Rork. Killing an Ayramun was a privilege reserved for Ayram.
Before Seb could get out a word, Moteah grabbed her by the breast of her robe and yanked her down behind the boulder. Seb twisted the girl’s hand away and held it firm in her wiry grip.
“What’d ya kill him for!?”
Moteah put her finger to her lips and shushed. Seb grimaced then spat the whole borcandi blob that had been stewing in her cheek. She spat it right at Moteah’s face, but quick as a cat, Moteah ducked out of its terrifying arc and the wad landed with a splat on Gugi’s chest. Gugi squealed in disgust as he flicked the gooey gunk away. Moteah clapped his mouth shut with her free hand and her eyes flared caution at both of them. She pointed with her chin to the opposite bank and mouthed a silent warning—Hrks.
Seb let go of Moteah’s wrist and peered around the boulder. There across the ravine were two shawled figures wandering out of the mist. At first she took them for Ayramun, but the first of them made a foreign gesture towards the other, and when Seb saw a flash of white under one of their ruddy cloaks she knew for sure—these were Hrkan men.
The two figures paused, cocked their heads towards Seb like they’d felt her thoughts ripple the fog between them, and they dropped down flat against the ground.
Seb ducked fast behind her boulder. She turned to Moteah and had to restrain herself from shouting.
“They know!”
The sound was hardly out her mouth when from behind them, on their own safe side of the ravine, a Hrkan horn of war thrilled the air.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommmm

Hrkan battle horns are deep and drooping bleats that tremble the bones of even the most well armored lizards, and Seb was clad in nothing but rags. When the horn blast jumped up behind her it startled her out of her skin. She yelped and swore and swiveled around to face the terror, and there, deep in the fog, running right towards her, was a blurry host of men, Hrkan Skulsi, white coats flashing bright under brown disguises. Maybe twenty or more of them.
They moved in silence, a leggy, white speckled blob, all business, just jogging right up like they were lost and about to ask for the way to the road. They didn’t try to intimidate with screams and yells, for in truth they were killers, not soldiers. The power of the Mazidai had long made armies obsolete, so the kind of professional fighting man that the Hrkan world breeds is one who lusts for the frenzy of small skirmishes where the pain of death is anesthetized in glory whenever man proves himself against man.
The horn bleated again.

BWEEEEEEEEEoooooooooooooooooommmm

The Skulsi blob began to sprint. 
Seb felt a strange warmth running down her thigh and she realized that she’d pissed herself. Moteah loosed an arrow at the running blob and before the girl saw the results, she took off sprinting west, back up along the ravine and towards the mountains. Seb took off after her, and the rest of the Ayramun followed. They trimmed the ravine, pursued by that mob of Hrks, while on the opposite bank those two Hkran cloaks had somehow multiplied into twenty. They shadowed the Ayramun, silent like the others, and they bunched up against the ravine as they waited for the terrain to present an opportunity to close the gap and kill. Seb nocked an arrow mid stride and shot it across, but it flew harmlessly into the mist. Others had more luck—Gugi put an arrow through the leading man’s leg, and the man behind him was struck down when an arrow rammed into the side of his skull. The two figures crumpled to the ground and those behind bumbled over them, but this did little to slow the chase. 
Then Moteah jumped down into the ravine.
Seb wondered what insanity could have possessed the girl to give those Hrkan Skulsi a leaping chance, when in the next instant, a thin, golden beam of Mazidfire came ripping right by her ear.
The line of this blazing fire screamed out in the misty distance, and like a sword it began to swipe. Seb ducked low and avoided its arc, but the men behind her weren’t so lucky. The fire ran right through the back of Gugi’s head and burst out of his eye-socket as if his brains and bone weren’t there. His body slumped down, and the fireline’s distant fulcrum swiveled, sending the beam of death swiping downwards through the air, cutting four Ayramun into uneven halves before smashing into the earth, its tremendous heat sizzling the soggy clay as it went.
Then as suddenly as the Mazidfire came, it was gone, it went roaring into earth, leaving in its wake charred flesh, black glass, glowing stone, and smoke.
Those still alive threw themselves down the ravine’s steep slope. Seb bumped into a karkle bush on the way down and rolled uncontrollably to the bottom where she flopped belly-first onto the muddy ground and slid with a splash into the ravine’s nascent stream. The rest of the Ayramun were already scrambling to their feet and fleeing along after Moteah. Seb stayed put, for there in front of her eyes was the very bush she’d seen that morning—the bush from under which she’d pulled those accursed bones. Its black twigs bloomed above her like a monument to fate. Her mind was unpinned by the significance of it, and she felt that awesome humbling chill which only comes when one catches a glimpse of the divine plan.
She tried to reel back in by telling herself this bush was just a bush—no more or less a major player in the divine plan as the mud squishing against her stomach, or even Ayram himself. Yes, this bush was just a bush.
And yet…
And yet she was supposed to crawl up under that bush and so she did. She crawled up under it, and she lay herself down where those bones had been, and she watched through the brambles as the Hrks descended upon her straggling companions.
Ten of the leaping Hrks were shot down by arrows before their feet landed in the ravine, yet the Skulsi, undaunted, charged on. Their feet flung mud as their powerful strides closed the distance as fast as swept-backs. Seb cowered under the bush lest the obligation of battle came to her. Her gut turned at the sight of one man sticking his boot on the back of her comrade’s head, suffocating him in the mud. But the Ayramun were valiant, and this cruelty was paid in turn with a knife stuck through the gut. 
 Seb could not see much of the battle, but she heard its sounds well enough. Metal clanged, mud-caked fists smacked faces with squelching thumps, sharp elbows cracked against ribs. No doubt that fling of limb and muck was rich with fighting deeds that warranted songs. Side whittled side until a Skulsi gave a gruff shout to stop—there was only one Ayramun left, and the man who shouted claimed the right of single combat. The rest of the Hrks ran off into the fog to search for more pokes to poke.
Seb watched through blurred vision as the last two mud-caked combatants sized each other amongst the smattering of corpses. Both were wounded and breathing hard with blades held out before them. By this point the rain had stopped. Seb felt the itch of purpose stirring in her stomach. Perhaps the bush had reserved her for this very moment, for here was an opportunity for decisive action, and that was all anyone could ever ask for—clarity of cause and effect—the outcome of a skirmish turned with her.
Seb twisted out from under her bush to fire an arrow at the man she took to be a Hrk, but just as she did, two figures stepped up to the lip of the ravine above her. The shorter one opened its mouth and a golden beam of Mazidfire burst out, cutting both combatants in two.
Seb froze in fear at the sight of the Mazid and its Minder. She scuffled back up under her bush.
She had never seen a Mazid before, and she couldn’t see much of it now. It was shorter than its Minder by a good foot, the height of a youth. It was skinny, and its gangly self was wrapped up in blue robes and a blue cowl like a penitent priest. Seb couldn’t see the eyes, only the general gauntness of its face, which was white as sea foam, like the creature had been dipped in cream. Seb squinted to try to get a better look because it didn’t appear to have any hair. Its chin was smooth and hairless as an egg, and its brows were shaven. The Minder was a normal Jandri man, dressed in the standard scribal robes—a richer, brighter blue with a blue hooded cape that blanketed his broad shoulders like a pelt.
Another man joined the two figures up on that bank. Unlike the others, he was a natural born Hrk through and through—blackred hair, greying around the temples, with copper skin and eyebrows so thick they could flog lizard skin. His dark cloak was held together by a silver sunrose brooch—the mark of military command, and underneath this cloak were the white robes of a Skulsi. This captain marched up to the much shorter Mazid, and he bore a look of such contempt that he seemed about to strike.
“Explain yourself!” the captain shouted as he pointed to the two sizzling corpses down in the ravine.
“I don’t know what you mean,” said the Mazid, meekly.
The captain chafed at the Mazid’s play of ignorance. “You killed one of my men.”
“I didn’t know which was which.”
“So you killed both?!” The captain then turned on the Mazid’s Minder. “I don’t know how you people breed these things, but something is wrong. Each one is dumber than the last.”
The Minder had a dark, square face and a patch of hair which crawled underneath his bottom lip, and when he clicked his tongue at the captain, the patch curled, underlining his annoyance. “You preach to the choir,” he said. “You’ve only had to deal with the Mazid for a week, whereas I am bonded to it.”
“You’re half the problem. You’re supposed to control it!”
“This is a difficult breed. The Lords say they’re balancing intelligence with docility, but then they bind me to this Mazid, which is neither intelligent nor amenable to instruction, and when I complain they tell me to bear it like I’ve been trained. So bear it, captain—those are not my words, but the words of the Lords.”
The Skulsi captain looked about ready to strangle them both. The Minder shrugged him off and said to his Mazid, “Apologize to the captain.”
“Apologize!?” the captain fumed. “What use do I have for an apology? Tell me, what can I do with it?”
“You can—”
“Don’t answer!”
The Minder shrugged again. In his right hand was a short rod of wood wrapped in braided leather. He held it up to the captain and said, “You may hit it if you like. It won’t hurt the creature as it doesn’t feel pain, but I find it works out my frustrations nonetheless.”
The captain took the rod firm in hand.
“Avoid the head and neck,” said the Minder. “And obviously, the stomach.”
The captain swung the rod and brought it down hard on the Mazid’s shoulder socket. A smack rang out, and the Mazid’s arm sunk down and went limp, clearly dislocated. Though the blow was brutal, Seb winced more than the Mazid did.
The Captain stepped back to appreciate the bludgeoning. “They don’t make Mazidai like they used to,” he said.
“They don’t.”
“It’s a wonder the Lords make use of these things at all. They’ve long outlived their utility. We Skulsi can handle outlaws on our own.”
The scribal Minder clicked his tongue at this remark. “Captain,” he said with disdain, “the only reason you are dealing with outlaws at all is because outland tribes are too whipped by the Mazidai to become anything more than outlaws. Get rid of my office and my charge, and you might find yourself on the front line of a real battle.”
“What do you mean, a real battle?”
“I meant no disrespect.”
“Sounded like disrespect.”
“I assure you, I meant no disrespect.”
Though Seb could not see well, she could see that the captain was about to explode. Every fiber of his Skulsi discipline was snapping.
The Minder drew his lips tight. “If you’ve something foul to say, then let’s have it out.”
The old captain glowered at both the Minder and the Mazid. “Remember that you are here to make things easier for me, not the other way around. And I’d say that killing my men outright is a violation of that mission. Worthy of censure! If you were not a Minder, I would have had you burned out for incompetency!”
The Minder was unimpressed. “If I were not a Minder you could do all manner of things. But fantasies are the domain of children and beggars, not soldiers who stand up straight. White light, we speak of the decline of the Mazidai, but if you are Hrkan Skulsi then I worry doubly for the Lordship.”
“You have a problem with me?”
“I do. Look at you—pomped up like you deserve something better than what you have, like you don’t understand that I can speak to you how I want. Worry about yourself, captain, lest that self-important stomach growl too loudly and forget the station of its Spark.”
“You’d threaten a captain of the Skulsi!?”
“I would if he threatened a Minder and his Mazid.”
The captain smirked, then put his hands on his hips and eyed the Minder with a gleam of amusement. “I doubt you have the control,” he said. “Just the other day one of my men saw your Mazid let an outland poke run free. It could have easily burned the man down, but it didn’t.”
“That man went free because the Mazid doesn’t control the fire. I do.”
“What do you mean?”
“I mean exactly what I said.”
The captain’s face screwed up as he slowly put two and two together. “Are you saying you killed my man?”
“I didn’t know which was which,” said the Minder as he cracked a sly grin.
The captain’s jaw dropped in shock. “Wait until Lord Gagan hears about this! He’ll have you out in the pastures where you belong, minding sheep not Mazidai!”
The Minder countenanced the captain’s threat with a skeptical brow. Seb could sense the man’s stinging smugness even from beneath her karkle bush. 
Then the Minder said to the Mazid, “Kill that man.”
The Mazid’s throat glowed gold and in a flash its mouth was ablaze with the fire of gods as a thin beam of golden light shot out. A heartbeat later, the captain crumpled to the ground. In the place where his forehead used to be was a black and smoldering hole. What was left of his face was fixed in hurtled surprise.
The Minder grunted in satisfaction before regarding his Mazid with contempt. “Don’t you ever think about what you want or don’t want. You don’t have wants. Get creative with my orders again and I’ll have us both sent back to the guild for—”
His words were interrupted by the act of the Mazid shuffling towards the ravine’s lip. Shock dawned on his face as the creature began to climb down into the ravine.
“What are you doing?” the Minder spat, but the Mazid did not answer. It had reached the ravine’s belly and was walking towards Seb’s bush. It was close enough now that Seb could see its gaunt visage clearly—a ghoul of a person, with silver, empty, Sparkless eyes.
“Stop!” the Minder commanded with a shout. His word shook the Mazid’s spine. It paused, struggled a step, then continued on as if laden with chains.
The Minder stretched out his left arm, which was missing a hand. The stubby wrist wrapped in white cotton and ornamented with golden trinkets affixed in a net of delicate golden chains. He pointed this jangling nub at the Mazid and screamed, “STOP!”
The shout was so strong it had form and purpose, it punched the simpering rain and exploded out to clear a bubble of dry air into existence, flinging the raindrops out of it, sending them spraying over Seb’s bush and the world beyond. Indeed, the shout was so strong that it wrenched Seb’s own Spark in her stomach, and it struck the Mazid with a crippling force, as every single muscle in the creature’s scrawny body snapped taut as if snagged by time. This creature tilted, unbalanced, and when the bubble of rain collapsed and a blanket of water fell, the Mazid fell too, stiff as stone, splashing onto the muddy ground. It landed without much heft, like it was a blanket tossed.
Though it was still against its will, its gray eyes remained unnervingly alert. They swiveled in their sockets and found Seb inside her bush, and Seb lay transfixed. In Seb’s long journeys through the Sand she had looked every manner of creature in the eye, and in each of them she’d found some sort of kinship—not so when she beheld the pale-white, bald, browless, lashless, silver-eyed Mazid.
Her fixation on this creature was broken when the Minder climbed down into the belly of the ravine. This short effort put the man out of breath, and he stood still for a moment before marching over to the Mazid and giving it a probing kick. The Mazid was stiff as a board. The Minder cursed his own luck, then picked the limb-bent creature up, put it upon his shoulder, and began to walk away. He was almost lost in the mist when Seb scrunched out of her bush and drew her boot knife.
 She crept along, making extra sure she didn’t slop too loudly in the muck as she closed the distance to the Minder’s misty figure. Stalking a man with his back turned triggered Seb’s instinct for the hunt, and she matched the Minder’s footfalls and kept herself ready to leap. Excitement swelled when the Minder strolled past the bodies of Rork and the Hrkan wagonmaster, for there were also horses to hide her noise.
She picked up her pace. The first horse eyed her dumbly, oblivious to her murderous pursuit. Soon she was only yards away from the Minder, and when Seb could no longer contain herself, she screamed such a deep and wild scream that it surprised even herself.
The Minder dropped his burden in fright. Seb plunged her knife into the man’s flinching shoulder. She yanked it out and the blade blurred against the back-swinged arc of blood before getting lost altogether as Seb rushed through a flurry of blows. The Minder twisted and fell into the sticky mud. He tried to scramble free, tried to shove aside her fury, but the man had only one good hand. He raised his ornamented forearm to shield his face, but Seb’s knife was there between the golden chains, and it was there again between the ribs, and there in the stomach, and in the neck, then cutting through the bone in his flailing elbow. Seb jabbed at the man’s throat, and jabbed again, and again, and she did not let up until her knife slipped out of her hand from the glut of blood.
A few gratuitous punches later, and the Minder was dead.
Seb sat back on the dead man’s waist and admired the kill. It wasn’t clean, but the struggle had been quick, one-sided, and glorious. Seb admired her ultimate prize, the pale Mazid, who lay limp in the mud behind. Its eyes were stilled and its body was dead, as it was no longer bound to any will. The sight of it settled Seb into the realization that she’d succeeded where all the other Ayramun had failed, and an exultant cheer welled up in her stomach. She made to let loose victory, but her shout was chilled by the sight of a short, irascible pillar of black rags standing only a few yards away.
It was the old witch Elrahet.
Some unseemly witchness had swept the woman down from her mountain cave, and there she stood in the mist. Her dark eyes quested the muddy ground, ignoring Seb and her glory. She followed some unseen trail towards the Hrkan wagon, and she hobbled over to it. Once there, she used her gnarled cane to prod at the body which had fallen out of the wagon’s bed.
Seb quickly gathered herself up, and the limp Mazid as well, and hustled over to the witch to show off her prize. She held the Mazid’s body out as an offering, expecting praise, but Elrahet merely glanced and nodded. She was more concerned with the dead Jandri youth at her feet and the wagon itself, which was packed to the boards with more dead Jandri youths. They’d been crammed inside the bed like poached pigs. Elrahet knocked one of their dangling arms with her cane and said, in her sneering way, “The Amalgamete has outgrown its suckling chin.”
The sight of so many bodies unsettled Seb’s stomach, even though she herself was coated in mud and the blood of a man she had just stabbed to pieces.
“They’re not dead,” Elrahet said scornfully. “I can smell their Sparks, cursed to the flesh. Look.” The dead boy at her feet was half-slipped from his white tunic, revealing his legs and uglies. Elrahet poked him in the stomach with her cane to drag the tunic further up, revealing a raspberry ring of darkness welling up under the skin and circling his belly-button.
“He was meant for food,” Elrahet said.
“Food?” Seb asked.
“Food for the Amalgamete. We’ve not caught our Mazid a moment too soon, for the beast is grown enough to eat.”
“You sure?”
Elrahet sneered at the implication that she could possibly be wrong. “Give me the Mazid,” the Old witch snipped.
Seb lay the Mazid’s blanket-weight on the witch’s stooped shoulder.
“And you take the boy.”
“What?” Seb asked.
“Pick up the boy and carry him.”
“Why?”
Elrahet did not answer, for she never answered a question like, ‘why’. ‘Why’ was asked of people who could not see the threads of purpose which weave a certain future. Elrahet could see them. It was rumored that she’d weaved some of them herself.
Elrahet waddled away, down the ravine. Her wet rags dragged behind and scraped the mud, leaving a slug-like trail behind as she bore the Mazid into the mist.
Seb picked up the skinny boy and followed. </Text>
