        <Title>Before Ixnay Obo</Title>
        <Text>The first object of note was the half-buried corpse of a large lizard, maybe half Mandri’s size. It was freshly dead from the storm, though it didn’t look like it, as most of its flesh had been stripped from the bone. What was left was being torn up by a small horde of flying beetles that looked like green jewels. Seb briefly stopped to collect as many of these beetles as she could. She offered one to Mandri, but Mandri declined.
Seb said, “They’re good chewin’, but I don’t got the teeth for ‘em anymore.” She proceeded to suck out the beetle’s innards through its rump like it were an oyster.
A few feet away from this dead lizard was a living one of the same species. Moteah called it a garool, and she said they slept unstirred under the sand for months until a rain came, and they’d wake up, mate, lay eggs, feast, then return to their quiescence. A charmed life, if not for the fact that this one’s partner was dead.</Text>
