        <Title>Before Ixnay Obo</Title>
        <Text>Ayram led them to a southeast leading Charnel road called the Hatthir road. There were plenty of pilgrim skeletons lying about the Hatthir road. One of them, it turned out, was still alive. Ayram noticed the man first. He picked up the poor pilgrim and set him the shade of a makeshift tent. The dying pilgrim stared out at all the Ayramun with winkless eyes. His skin was like paper, and his ribs were countable through the window in his yellow haircloth habit.
This pilgrim thought Ayram was Solraheen enfleshed. Ayram did not disabuse him of this notion. He sponged water onto the man’s lips, and the man wheezed out a few final words which no one heard.
Mandri gave the pilgrim a rock he’d found the day before. It was a hollow tube of rock scrubbed smooth by sand. Obo had said it wasn’t a rock, but part of a hardened reed. Whatever it was, it put a passing joy into the pilgrim’s eyes, and Mandri was glad to see it. Then they all moved on to let him die.</Text>
