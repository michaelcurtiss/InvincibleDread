        <Title>Before Force Purl</Title>
        <Text>If a Hrkan Lord wins a great battle then he is permitted to depict this event without reference to Solraheen. The genre of the conquering hero existed in the time when Solraheen still walked the earth, and most of those ancient hero icons contained no sign of Solraheen, so it was thought that if Solraheen permitted it back then, then it must be righteous in His eyes, and so it must be allowed forever.
But why would Solraheen approve of such effrontery? The leading Solitant view was that Solraheen afforded the Lords this privilege so as to harness their natural pride. He wanted them willing and eager to go out and expand the borders of paradise. When a Hrkan Lord brought barbarians to heel, wealth and land was his, and so too was the right to place himself at the front of all creation—if only for one single work of art. It may seem heretical, but if Solraheen Himself approved of it, then by definition should be the orthodox view.
An alternative theory is that the genre of the conquering hero, in its original form, was not meant to be a carrot but a stick. A statue of a snarling Lord was meant to instill fear in the poor wretches who were conquered, and Solraheen, being a loving god, did not want to be associated with this imagery, so he allowed the Lords to forgo the traditional sign of respect. When the dispossessed saw the statues of Lords from a foreign land, they did not see the sign of Solraheen, and so they did not blame Him for their misery.
The relief of Arnaggu is, perhaps, the surest testament to this theory. Arnaggu is the oldest conquering hero of Hkran descent, the first Hrkan Lord, and in some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towers above the sandswept Forni plain. It is a terrifying piece. The relief itself sits four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicts stretches all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image is a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen, limbs splayed out like flattened lizards, faces fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu’s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is ten times as large as any other. He stands at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage, and his upper torso and head are the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seems to be tearing himself out of the rock, his face angry, teeth bared, as if he’d just heard whispers of rebellious speech and was rising to the challenge.
Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen. To him it was obvious that the relief’s purpose was to tranquilize the people of the Forni. And despite that prickling sense of awe that stippled his skin, he was wholly unimpressed with it. He saw past all of its tricks, first and foremost the over-reliance on scale—make something big enough and a person standing next to it is bound to feel small, and here, Arnaggu had taken a shortcut to scale by carving his image into a mountain, and so the viewer is forced to contend with not only the relief but the entirety of the rock. 
 Not even the great relief of Arnaggu could convince Mandri of the truth behind the conceit of the conquering hero. No man was born to conquer. He’d seen Hrkan Lords in the flesh, and they were small men indeed.
But he’d never seen a man the size of Ayram.
Mandri was sitting, bored, in the Ayramun’s limestone pit, still recovering from the rigor of death. The sun had crossed over to noon, and it shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. Most of the Ayramun retreated into the tunnel. Mandri preferred the warmth and had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, chattering excitedly like children. Then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention, and there, out of the shadows, came Ayram.
Ayram looked like Arnaggu himself stepping out from that rock relief, for he was a true giant, and his stern countenance seemed carved from stone. His hair was wrapped up in a red headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a round, black, bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style of beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet, who was himself named after a mountain. Ayram wasn’t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens—he was a true giant. And the way he moved, his long legs swaddled in thin and faded black wool, swinging in a loping gait, he seemed like something more than human. If it wasn't for the bearded head sprouting out of that mass of black robes, Mandri would have thought that Ayram was a demon.
Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, he carried under his arm the body of a conquered wretch—none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo.
Set against Ayram’s bronzed skin, black robes, and giant frame, Obo was as pale and as small as a naked rat. Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him, all staring at the Mazid like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for their master to divide the meal.
Then Ayram spoke. His voice was low and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous hest.
“Elrahet!” he said.
Mandri took the word to be some obscure Old Jandri expression. Then out of the cave came a short old woman hobbling along with a cane. She was clouded in a mass of ruffled up black tatters, and she kept her shawled head downcast in deference. With her spine as bowed as it was, her head couldn’t reach Ayram’s hip.
“Yes, my lord?” she croaked.
“Go fetch Purl,” said Ayram. It was a simple command, but issued in Ayram’s voice every word seemed a threat.
“But, my lord...”
Ayram clicked his tongue and the old woman grumbled, then shuffled back into the cave from which she had come.
All eyes returned to the Mazid kneeling in the sun. Obo seemed oddly at ease in the ire of his captors. He knelt there in the sand, stared at a spot of earth, and stayed silent as if in prayer.
Ayram looked the Mazid up and down. “I didn’t know they were so damn ugly,” he declared.
A few belly quaking chortles sounded out, most of them coming from Tob, who was quite pleased to see a Mazid so down on its luck. But if Obo was sunk in despair, he did not show it.
“Should I stand?” Obo asked them all. “I’ll stand so you all can get a better look.”
Obo stood up and presented himself to the bandits. His pale white skin was nearly blinding in the sun. The awkward nakedness of his unnatural body drew hearty jeers. Tob was quick to point out that this Mazid didn’t have an asshole.
“No wonder he acts like his shit don’t stink,” he said, smirking.
“It does when it comes out the mouth,” said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.
“Bet it does!” Tob roared. He slapped his knee and then killed the joke by hitting it square in the face—“Shit comes out its mouth because its full of shit!”
His belly-rumbling laugh triggered the rest of the Ayramun to rain a storm of obscenities down upon the Mazid. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, beard frowning, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.
Obo was unperturbed. He bore their insults with a casual shrug and the indifferent bearing of a man who’d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo smiled as if to gloat. This triggered another roar of fury and renewed calls for the Mazid’s head. Ayram settled them all down with a shrill, sharp, two-fingered whistle. 
Obo turned to Ayram and said, “Are you going to kill me?”
Ayram shook his head.
Obo inspected his blood-nubbed arms and said, “So it’s just the torture, then?” 
“No torture,” said Ayram as his black loaf of a beard cracked open to reveal a clean smile. “You’ll to need the rest of your limbs. Your legs most of all. You can’t kneel to your new Lord if you don’t have knees.”
The rest of the Ayramun chuckled at Ayram’s menacing words.
So did Obo. He said, “I’m comfortable standing, thank you.”
“We’ll see,” said Ayram. he turned towards the darkness of the cave and yelled, “Elrahet!”
From somewhere inside the cave, Elrahet grumbled. Her voice was so ancient and weathered that it seemed for a moment like the cave itself was speaking.
“Sol’s shade, I’m coming…”
When she shuffled out again into the sun, she was not alone. Stumbling along with her was a Jandri girl wrapped in a mottled, brown blanket. She leaned against Elrahet’s stooped back, and the pair moved with deliberate care as the girl was clearly drugged, or drunk. Mandri guessed drunk because she walked with that familiar rhythmless, scuffing, shuffle of blurred instinct. She would have fallen at least twice if Elrahet was not there to steady the load. Old as Elrahet was, it seemed she possessed a sympathetic strength.
When this girl set her eyes on the Mazid her chin jerked up, and the sun’s light revealed to all a sickly pale face, which is no small thing for a Jandri girl reddened by kell oil and the sun. Her high and narrow cheeks were troubled by a huge mess of tousled brown hair and a clear lack of sleep, though her dark eyes were set in cold resolve as she fought back a grimace with every step. Huddled up as she was under the blanket, the source of her pain was not clear.
Ayram grabbed the girl’s shoulder and pulled her off of Elrahet. He shook her gently, and he called her name to bring her to attention. 
“Purl,” he said. “Purl, look at me.”
Purl looked up at the giant with bleared amazement. 
“It’s time,” said Ayram. “I want you to command the Mazid. Command it to kneel to me.”
Ayram let go of Purl and she, unbalanced, swayed into his hip. Ayram caught her, held her steady, then pointed his long arm at Obo and said, “Go on.”
Purl poked a trembling hand out of her blanket and rubbed her swollen eyes. Then she took a deep breath, steadied herself, and when she was good and ready, she commanded the Mazid to Kneel. Her voice was soft and troubled.
“Kneel.”
Obo did not move.
“Could you say that again?” Obo asked. “I didn’t quite catch your meaning.”
Purl clenched her teeth and stood up straight. With a snarl reminiscent of the stories of Junkite Queens, she bellowed, “Kneel!”
Mandri thought he saw the sand shiver under Purl’s bare feet, and he squirmed as a cool air blew down from nowhere and brushed his flouncy curls and sun-baked skin. If it was magic, it was a poor effort, for Obo did not kneel.
“Come now,” said Obo. “If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
His dismissiveness enraged the girl. She tossed off her blanket, and along with it went any sign of the lethargy and pain which plagued her features. She held out her left arm, and there her hand, much like Obo’s, was missing—only recently severed off. The resulting nub was poulticed and bandaged tight, though without much care, as strands of wet and green leafy weeds dangled out of it. She aimed this weedy thing at the Mazid as if it were a weapon.
“KNEEL!” she screamed, and her shout shook Mandri’s heart in its calloused cage. The word rattled the pit’s chalky walls, then rebounded into the cave behind her, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back. That this powerful shout had come from such a frail and ailing girl was the least incredible thing, for the air between Purl and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if the girl’s very shout had somehow thwacked the sandy ground like an invisible whip.
Obo’s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether. For a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Purl’s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. 
“Almost!” said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had sapped Purl of her strength. She wobbled and collapsed to her knees.
“Oh,” said Obo, “is that what you wanted me to do?”
Mandri had to stifle a snicker at this brazen taunt. The old woman, Elrahet, hissed at the Obo and rushed to console the defeated Purl. Ayram sighed, then he strolled over to Obo so that he towered over the creature. With his hands on hips he looked like a bewildered father.
“Why are you not kneeling?” he asked Obo, plainly.
Obo stood defiant, naked and without shame, and he met Ayram’s eye with blank stare.
“I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
“But you are bound to the girl,” said Ayram, confused.
“If you say so.”
“She is your Minder.”
“She is.”
“But she can’t control you? If the girl can’t control you, then why haven’t you split me in half with Mazidfire?”
“I am not controlled by my Minder’s will, I am bound by it.”
Ayram’s bushy brow twisted in confusion. “What’s the difference?” he asked.
“A Minder cannot command me to do anything, they can only stop me from doing something they don’t want me to do.”
“You lie.”
“I do not.”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to do something, and stopping you from doing something?”
“To command is to direct, to stop is to interfere.”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which, just kneel before me.”
There was a clever wrinkle to Ayram’s words, and they gave Obo pause. A flicker of amusement flashed across his too-smooth, too-pale features, before he said, “Think of a Mazid as being bound by a leash to its Minder.”
“Go on,” said Ayram.
“The Minder’s strength of will determines how much slack is on that leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash. That it gives them some measure of control. Your girl’s will is enough to stop me from killing you all, but I suspect that she does not possess the strength for much else.”
Ayram chewed on Obo’s words. He seemed as if he did not like the taste.
“Someone toss me a dagger,” he said abruptly.
A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram’s feet. Ayram picked it up. The blade seemed like a toothpick in his great hand. He stepped towards the Mazid, reached down, and put the blade’s edge up tight against the side of Obo’s neck.
“Kneel,” he said.
“Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from the girl.”
Ayram rotated the dagger so that its point was digging into Obo’s skin. He said through gritted teeth, “If I can’t get you to do what I want, then I have no use for you.”
“Then I suggest you direct your attention towards the girl.”
Ayram pushed the tip of the dagger into Obo’s flesh. The sharp blade slid straight into the neck, and Ayram pushed it through to the hilt. Mandri could hardly believe what he was seeing—it was reminiscent of some sword-swallower’s trick, only it was no trick, this blade was clearly thrust right through the neck. If it were a human’s neck, there’d be arteries and tendons severed, there’d be blood gushing out, but when Ayram withdrew the blade, barely a trickle of red spilled out from the wound.
Ayram tossed the knife away in disgust. He stepped back and began to pace to and fro, rubbing his great brow, wondering aloud, “What to do? What. To. Do?”
“Purl needs time,” said old Elrahet.
Ayram paused his pacing and glared at the old woman, effectively shutting her up. Then he continued on again, back and forth, back and forth. It was such a show of hard thinking that Mandri began to suspect that the man wasn’t actually thinking at all, and that this was for his follower’s benefit, to give them the impression that he hadn’t let things get completely out of his control.
Obo said aloud, “I have a potential solution.” 
“Do you?” said Ayram, feigning interest.
“You have something I want, and I have something you want.”
“A bargain, is it? A little give and take?”
“Yes,” said Obo. “A bargain.”
A few chuckles rose from amongst Ayramun. Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his.
“I don’t treat with Hrks,” said Ayram flatly.
“I am not a Hrk.” 
“Yes, you are.”
“What I am is beholden to you, and I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don’t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. If you give me a mouthful of water then I will kneel to you. I will grovel, if you like.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the unnamed Ayramun and asked for their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram caught it, opened it up and took a drink. He swished it around his mouth, bulging his beard, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he said, “I didn’t know Mazidai needed water.”
“We don’t,” said Obo. “This is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of good faith.”
“You first, then,” Ayram said. “Give us a gesture of goodwill—to demonstrate the principle.”
Obo immediately got down on one knee. He even bent his head, and it was honest. It was pure and simple obeisance. When this was done, Ayram held the waterskin out before him and poured the rest of its contents into the sand.
The Ayramun erupted in laughter. Mandri didn’t laugh, but not because he thought it was cruel. The sight of that cool, crystal water being wasted on the sand brought his own thirst into stark relief.
If Obo was bothered by any of it, he did not show it, and when Ayram finished with his little show, Obo said, “I will change your mind about me.”
“You killed fifteen of my people,” said Ayram.
“I did not have much of a choice.”
“You said that a Minder can’t make you do anything.”
“I did. But—”
“No! No, no, no. Stop talking—Moto, Tob, come hold it flat.”
Tob and a tall black Zozan stood up and rushed over to the kneeling Mazid. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand, throwing punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. Meanwhile, Ayram wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar. It was one piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head, and at one end was a splayed chisel, and at the other was a round ball the size of his great fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled it as if it were a spear.
“If I can’t make you kneel how I want you to kneel, then you won’t need your legs. Besides, we can’t risk you running away again.”
Ayram raised his spear. Mandri shut his eyes. He could hide from the sight but He could not from the sound of Ayram’s chisel-head spear stabbing into Obo’s upper leg, snapping the bone. And he couldn’t help but sneak a peek as the Zosan, Moto, knelt down next to Obo’s left hip, and hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons, and  they began their gruesome work again on Obo’s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.
Through it all, Obo did not squeak or speak a sound.
When it was done, and Obo was legless, Ayram said, “Someone bag the Mazid up! We’ve got a long walk ahead of us.”
All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled into their cave to grab more. Forty came over to Mandri and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked across the pit, he glanced towards Obo, whose freshly broken body was a frightful sight. And just as Mandri’s heart was strafed by the shame of even bearing witness, that damned bald Mazid looked him right in the eye, smiled, and gave him another wink.

“KNEEL!” she screamed, and her shout shook Mandri’s heart in its calloused cage. The word rattled the pit’s chalky walls, then rebounded into the cave behind her, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back. That this powerful shout had come from such a frail and ailing girl was the least incredible thing, for the air between Purl and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if the girl’s very shout had somehow thwacked the sandy ground like an invisible whip.
Obo’s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether. For a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Purl’s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. 
“Almost!” said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had sapped Purl of her strength. She wobbled and collapsed to her knees.
“Oh,” said Obo, “is that what you wanted me to do?”
Mandri had to stifle a snicker at this brazen taunt. The old woman, Elrahet, hissed at the Obo and rushed to console the defeated Purl. Ayram sighed, then he strolled over to Obo so that he towered over the creature. With his hands on hips he looked like a bewildered father.
“Why are you not kneeling?” he asked Obo, plainly.
Obo stood defiant, naked and without shame, and he met Ayram’s eye with blank stare.
“I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
“But you are bound to the girl,” said Ayram, confused.
“If you say so.”
“She is your Minder.”
“She is.”
“But she can’t control you? If the girl can’t control you, then why haven’t you split me in half with Mazidfire?”
“I am not controlled by my Minder’s will, I am bound by it.”
Ayram’s bushy brow twisted in confusion. “What’s the difference?” he asked.
“A Minder cannot command me to do anything, they can only stop me from doing something they don’t want me to do.”
“You lie.”
“I do not.”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to do something, and stopping you from doing something?”
“To command is to direct, to stop is to interfere.”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which, just kneel before me.”
There was a clever wrinkle to Ayram’s words, and they gave Obo pause. A flicker of amusement flashed across his too-smooth, too-pale features, before he said, “Think of a Mazid as being bound by a leash to its Minder.”
“Go on,” said Ayram.
“The Minder’s strength of will determines how much slack is on that leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash. That it gives them some measure of control. Your girl’s will is enough to stop me from killing you all, but I suspect that she does not possess the strength for much else.”
Ayram chewed on Obo’s words. He seemed as if he did not like the taste.
“Someone toss me a dagger,” he said abruptly.
A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram’s feet. Ayram picked it up. The blade seemed like a toothpick in his great hand. He stepped towards the Mazid, reached down, and put the blade’s edge up tight against the side of Obo’s neck.
“Kneel,” he said.
“Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from the girl.”
Ayram rotated the dagger so that its point was digging into Obo’s skin. He said through gritted teeth, “If I can’t get you to do what I want, then I have no use for you.”
“Then I suggest you direct your attention towards the girl.”
Ayram pushed the tip of the dagger into Obo’s flesh. The sharp blade slid straight into the neck, and Ayram pushed it through to the hilt. Mandri could hardly believe what he was seeing—it was reminiscent of some sword-swallower’s trick, only it was no trick, this blade was clearly thrust right through the neck. If it were a human’s neck, there’d be arteries and tendons severed, there’d be blood gushing out, but when Ayram withdrew the blade, barely a trickle of red spilled out from the wound.
Ayram tossed the knife away in disgust. He stepped back and began to pace to and fro, rubbing his great brow, wondering aloud, “What to do? What. To. Do?”
“Purl needs time,” said old Elrahet.
Ayram paused his pacing and glared at the old woman, effectively shutting her up. Then he continued on again, back and forth, back and forth. It was such a show of hard thinking that Mandri began to suspect that the man wasn’t actually thinking at all, and that this was for his follower’s benefit, to give them the impression that he hadn’t let things get completely out of his control.
Obo said aloud, “I have a potential solution.” 
“Do you?” said Ayram, feigning interest.
“You have something I want, and I have something you want.”
“A bargain, is it? A little give and take?”
“Yes,” said Obo. “A bargain.”
A few chuckles rose from amongst Ayramun. Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his.
“I don’t treat with Hrks,” said Ayram flatly.
“I am not a Hrk.” 
“Yes, you are.”
“What I am is beholden to you, and I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don’t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. If you give me a mouthful of water then I will kneel to you. I will grovel, if you like.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the unnamed Ayramun and asked for their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram caught it, opened it up and took a drink. He swished it around his mouth, bulging his beard, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he said, “I didn’t know Mazidai needed water.”
“We don’t,” said Obo. “This is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of good faith.”
“You first, then,” Ayram said. “Give us a gesture of goodwill—to demonstrate the principle.”
Obo immediately got down on one knee. He even bent his head, and it was honest. It was pure and simple obeisance. When this was done, Ayram held the waterskin out before him and poured the rest of its contents into the sand.
The Ayramun erupted in laughter. Mandri didn’t laugh, but not because he thought it was cruel. The sight of that cool, crystal water being wasted on the sand brought his own thirst into stark relief.
If Obo was bothered by any of it, he did not show it, and when Ayram finished with his little show, Obo said, “I will change your mind about me.”
“You killed fifteen of my people,” said Ayram.
“I did not have much of a choice.”
“You said that a Minder can’t make you do anything.”
“I did. But—”
“No! No, no, no. Stop talking—Moto, Tob, come hold it flat.”
Tob and a tall black Zozan stood up and rushed over to the kneeling Mazid. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand, throwing punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. Meanwhile, Ayram wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar. It was one piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head, and at one end was a splayed chisel, and at the other was a round ball the size of his great fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled it as if it were a spear.
“If I can’t make you kneel how I want you to kneel, then you won’t need your legs. Besides, we can’t risk you running away again.”
Ayram raised his spear. Mandri shut his eyes. He could hide from the sight but He could not from the sound of Ayram’s chisel-head spear stabbing into Obo’s upper leg, snapping the bone. And he couldn’t help but sneak a peek as the Zosan, Moto, knelt down next to Obo’s left hip, and hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons, and  they began their gruesome work again on Obo’s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.
Through it all, Obo did not squeak or speak a sound.
When it was done, and Obo was legless, Ayram said, “Someone bag the Mazid up! We’ve got a long walk ahead of us.”
All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled into their cave to grab more. Forty came over to Mandri and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked across the pit, he glanced towards Obo, whose freshly broken body was a frightful sight. And just as Mandri’s heart was strafed by the shame of even bearing witness, that damned bald Mazid looked him right in the eye, smiled, and gave him another wink.

        <Title>Before Amalgamete Push</Title>
        <Text>The genre of the conquering hero existed in the time when Solraheen still walked the earth. Most of those ancient hero icons contained no sign of Solraheen, so it was thought that if Solraheen permitted an Old Jandri king to depict a victory without reference to Himself, then it must be permitted forever. If a Hrkan Lord wins a great battle then he is permitted to depict this event without reference to Solraheen. 
But why would Solraheen approve of such effrontery? The leading Solitant view is that Solraheen afforded great men this privilege so as to harness their natural pride. He wanted them willing and eager to go out and expand the borders of His paradise. When a Hrkan Lord brought barbarians to heel, wealth and land was his, and so too was the right to place himself at the front of all creation—if only for one single work of art. It may seem heretical, but if Solraheen Himself approved of it, then by definition it was the orthodox view.
An alternative interpretation of the form of the Old Jandri conquering hero is that it was not meant to be a carrot, but a stick. A statue of a snarling Lord was meant to instill fear in the poor wretches who were conquered, and Solraheen, being a loving god, did not want to be associated with this imagery. As such he allowed the Lords to forgo the traditional sign of respect. When the dispossessed saw the statues of Lords from a foreign land, they did not see the sign of Solraheen, and so they did not blame Him for their misery.
The relief of Arnaggu is, perhaps, the surest testament to this theory. Arnaggu is the oldest conquering hero of Hkran descent, the first Hrkan Lord, and in some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towers above the sandswept Forni plain. It is a terrifying piece. The relief itself sits four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicts stretches all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image is a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen, limbs splayed out like flattened lizards, with bared torsos and skirted like slaves, their faces are fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu’s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is ten times as large as any other. He stands at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage, and his upper torso and head are the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seems to be tearing himself out of the rock, face angry, teeth bared, as if he’d just heard whispers of rebellion and was rising to the challenge.
Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen. Despite that prickling sense of awe that stippled his skin, he was wholly unimpressed with it. He saw past all of its tricks. First and foremost was the over-reliance on scale—make something big enough and a person standing next to it is bound to feel small, and here, Arnaggu had taken a shortcut to scale by carving his image into a mountain, and so the viewer is forced to contend with not only the relief but the entirety of the rock. 
 Not even the great relief of Arnaggu could convince Mandri of the truth behind the conceit of the conquering hero. No man was born to conquer. He’d seen Hrkan Lords in the flesh, and they were ordinary men.
But he’d never seen a man the size of Ayram.

Mandri was sitting, bored, in the Ayramun’s limestone pit, still recovering from the rigor of death. The sun had crossed over to noon, and it shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. Most of the Ayramun retreated into the tunnel. Mandri preferred the warmth and had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, chattering excitedly like children. Then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention, and there, out of the shadows, came Ayram.


Ayram looked like Arnaggu himself stepping out from that rock relief, for he was a true giant, and his stern countenance seemed carved from stone. His hair was wrapped up in a red headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a round, black, bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style of beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet, who was himself named after a mountain. Ayram wasn’t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens—he was a true giant. And the way he moved, his long legs swaddled in thin and faded black wool, swinging in a loping gait, he seemed like something more than human. If it wasn't for the bearded head sprouting out of that mass of black robes, Mandri would have thought that Ayram was a demon.
Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, he carried under his arm the body of a conquered wretch—none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo.
Set against Ayram’s bronzed skin, black robes, and giant frame, Obo was as pale and as small as a naked rat. Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him, all staring at the Mazid like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for their master to divide the meal.
The awkward nakedness of Obo’s unnatural body drew hearty jeers. Tob was quick to point out that this Mazid didn’t have an asshole.
“No wonder he acts like his shit don’t stink,” he said, smirking.
“It does when it comes out the mouth,” said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.
“Bet it does!” Tob roared. He slapped his knee and then killed the joke by hitting it square in the face—“Shit comes out its mouth because its full of shit!”
His belly-rumbling laugh triggered a storm of obscenities that rained down upon the Mazid. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, beard frowning, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.
Obo was unperturbed. He bore their insults with a casual shrug and the indifferent bearing of a bullied child who’d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo smiled as if to gloat. This triggered another roar of fury and renewed calls for the Mazid’s head on a spike. Ayram settled them all down with a shrill, sharp, two-fingered whistle. 
Then Ayram spoke. His voice was low and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous chest.
“Elrahet!” he said.
Mandri took the word to be some obscure Old Jandri expression. Then out of the cave came a short old woman hobbling along with a cane. She was clouded in a mass of ruffled up black tatters, and she kept her shawled head downcast in deference. With her spine as bowed as it was, her head was no taller than Ayram’s hip.
She was not alone. Stumbling along behind her was a Jandri girl wrapped in a mottled, brown blanket. She leaned against Elrahet’s stooped back, and the pair moved with deliberate care as the girl was clearly drugged, or drunk. Mandri guessed drunk because she walked with that familiar rhythmless, scuffing, shuffle of blurred instinct. She would have fallen at least twice if Elrahet was not there to steady the load. Old as Elrahet was, it seemed she possessed a sympathetic strength.
When this girl set her eyes on the Mazid her chin jerked up, and the sun’s light revealed to all a sickly pale face, which is no small thing for a Jandri girl reddened by kell oil and the sun. Her high and narrow cheeks were troubled by a huge mess of tousled brown hair and a clear lack of sleep, though her dark eyes were set in cold resolve as she fought back a grimace with every step. Huddled up as she was under the blanket, the source of her pain was not clear.
Ayram grabbed the girl’s shoulder and pulled her off of Elrahet. He shook her gently, and he called her name to bring her to attention. 
“Purl,” he said. “Purl, look at me.”
Purl looked up at the giant with bleared amazement. 
“It’s time,” said Ayram. “I want you to command the Mazid. Command it to kneel to me.”
Ayram let go of Purl and she, unbalanced, swayed into his hip. Ayram caught her, held her steady, then pointed his long arm at Obo and said, “Go on.”
Purl poked a trembling hand out of her blanket and rubbed her swollen eyes. Then she took a deep breath, steadied herself, and when she was good and ready, she commanded the Mazid to Kneel. Her voice was soft and troubled.
“Kneel.”
Obo did not move.
“Could you say that again?” Obo asked. “I didn’t quite catch your meaning.”
Purl clenched her teeth and stood up straight. With a snarl reminiscent of the stories of Junkite Queens, she bellowed, “Kneel!”
Mandri thought he saw the sand shiver under Purl’s bare feet, and he squirmed as a cool air blew down from nowhere and brushed his flouncy curls and sun-baked skin. If it was magic, it was a poor effort, for Obo did not kneel.
“Come now,” said Obo. “If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
His dismissiveness enraged the girl. She tossed off her blanket, and along with it went any sign of the lethargy and pain which plagued her features. She held out her left arm, and there her hand, much like Obo’s, was missing—only recently severed off. The resulting nub was poulticed and bandaged tight, though without much care, as strands of wet and green leafy weeds dangled out of it. She aimed this weedy thing at the Mazid as if it were a weapon. She focused her energy into it, as if it approximated her dainty, severed hand that was stuck inside Obo’s chest, squeezing the malformed slug of muscle that passed for a heart.
“KNEEL!” she screamed, and her shout shook Mandri’s heart in its calloused cage. The word rattled the pit’s chalky walls, then rebounded into the cave behind her, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back out. That this powerful shout had come from such a frail and ailing girl was the least incredible thing, for the air between Purl and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if the girl’s very shout had somehow thwacked the sandy ground like an invisible whip.
Obo’s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether. For a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Purl’s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. 
“Almost!” said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had sapped Purl of her strength. She wobbled and collapsed to her knees.
“Oh,” said Obo, “is that what you wanted me to do?”

Obo stood defiant, naked and without shame, and he met Ayram’s eye with blank stare.
“I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
“But you are bound to the girl,” said Ayram, confused.
“If you say so.”
“She is your Minder.”
“She is.”
“But she can’t control you? If the girl can’t control you, then why haven’t you split me in half with Mazidfire?”
“I am not controlled by my Minder’s will, I am bound by it.”
Ayram’s bushy brow twisted in confusion. “What’s the difference?” he asked.
“A Minder cannot command me to do anything, they can only stop me from doing something they don’t want me to do.”
“You lie.”
“I do not.”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to do something, and stopping you from doing something?”
“To command is to direct, to stop is to interfere.”
“What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which, just kneel before me.”
There was a clever wrinkle to Ayram’s words, and they gave Obo pause. A flicker of amusement flashed across his too-smooth, too-pale features. “Think of a Mazid as being bound by a leash to its Minder.”

        <Title>Inject Elrahet</Title>
        <Text>Mandri stretched out his legs in a futile attempt to recover from the rigor of death. He wanted to stand up and walk around, but he was forced by circumstance to sit and wait in the bottom of the Ayramun’s limestone pit. He watched the sun as it crossed over to noon, such that its light shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. By then, most of the Ayramun had retreated into the tunnel. Forty stayed to keep watch over Mandri, and Mandri stayed because he thought he was supposed to. But he preferred the warmth. He set his back against the rock and shut his eyes, and he had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd of brown ragged pokes came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, away from Mandri, chattering excitedly like children. 
Mandri watched them blather, tried to pick up some hints about what was going on, then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention.
Out of the shadowed tunnel came Ayram.
Mandri had never seen a man so big.
He’d seen giants in paintings, but those were paintings. Those giants were Hrkan Lords painted to be twice their actual size, an unreality meant to lift up ordinary rulers in the eyes of their subjects. It was a genre known as ‘the conquering hero’, and it was a tired genre, a joke even amongst the Lords who knew they were ordinary men. And Mandri agreed. He’d never once spared an admiring thought for these men. The first thought that came to Mandri’s mind when he saw Ayram was, ‘Oh, shit,’ and the second was the more considered, ‘This must be Arnaggu’.
Arnaggu was the first Hrkan Lord, a true conquering hero, the inspiration for the genre. In some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towered above the windswept Forni plain. It was a terrifying piece. The relief itself sat four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicted stretched all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image was a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen dressed in the garb of slaves—naked torsos and skirted hips. Their limbs are splayed out like flattened lizards. Their faces are fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu’s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is depicted ten times larger than any other, and he stood at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage. His upper torso and head were the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seemed to be tearing himself out of the rock, eyes wild but brow untroubled, the look of royal rage, as if he’d just heard whispers of rebellion and was dead-set on cutting out the treacherous tongues with his blade.
Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen, and at first blush a prickling sense of awe stippled his skin. To contend with Arnaggu was to contend with the entirety of the rock.
Ayram looked like Arnaggu reborn, a true giant, with a stern countenance seemingly carved from stone. His hair was wrapped up in a black headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, black, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet Unkileen, who was himself named after a mountain. Ayram wasn’t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens. And the way he moved, with his too-long legs wrapped in faded black wool and swinging in a loping gait, he seemed possessed of that skinny-legged power that hides inside a horse.
Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, the man carried the body of a conquered wretch under his arm. This was none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo, whose bald head was twisted the right way around. Obo’s silver eyes blinked in the sun, and set against Ayram’s bronzed skin and black robes, his naked, chalk-white flesh was gleaming.
Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him. All of them stared at their master’s capture like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for a greasy hand to divvy up the meal. The awkward nakedness of Obo’s  body drew hearty jeers. Weeg was quick to point out that this Mazid didn’t have an asshole.
“No wonder he acts like his shit don’t stink,” he said, smirking.
“It do when it come out the mouth,” said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.
“Bet it does!” Tob roared. He then slapped his knee and killed the joke by hitting it square in the face. “Shit comes out its mouth because its full of shit!”
His belly-rumbling laugh was followed by a storm of obscenities that rained down upon poor Obo—almost all the Ayramun joined in. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.
Obo bore their insults with the bearing of a bullied child who’d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo stood up and smiled, almost gloating, and this triggered a roar of fury and renewed calls for the Obo’s head on a spike.
Ayram settled his people down with a shrill and sharp two-fingered whistle. 
He then turned to the cave from which he’d come and he shouted, “Elrahet!”.
His voice was deep and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous chest, and already echoed before they’d even left his lips, giving the unsettling impression that two men spoke at once..
An old woman’s voice came grumbling back from the cave.
“Sol’s light, I’m coming.”
A witch came hobbling out of the dark, clouded in a mass of ruffled black tatters, and leaning on a thigh-high cane of withered driftwood. She kept her shawled head downcast in deference, and with her spine as bowed as it was, she was no taller than Ayram’s hip.
She joined the Ayramun’s circle, completing it. As soon as she was settled, Ayram worked his piercing gaze upon the rest of his people, and eventually his eyes landed on Mandri.
“And you,” he said, “Come here.”
Forty pushed Mandri up, and whispered, “Go on.”
Mandri scuffled across the sand, passed a smirking Obo, and he stood before the giant, suddenly aware that everyone’s eyes were on him.
“What’s your name, boy?”
“Mandri.”
“Look at me, Mandri.”
Mandri looked up and tried to find Ayram’s eyes against a backdrop of blue-bright sky.
“You been crying, boy? ”
Mandri shook his head.
“Why are your eyes are red and witless, puffy?”
The old witch stepped forward, steadied herself on her gnarled cane and said, “His body has not yet recovered from death. His face is still stuffed with blood.” The shadow of her cowl hid a sneering squint that folded so much age around her eyes that the eyes themselves were little more than black seeds thumb-pressed into her sockets. And those seeds were moving, they flitted underneath those wrinkles, studying the outline of Mandri’s figure as if they could see the smell of death exuding out from him. Eventually they fixed on his wounded arm.
“How is it?” she asked flatly.
Mandri raised his poulticed wrist. The sight of it alone was sickening, for the once-white linen was stained brown and black, and tufts of rotted vegetative matter sprouted out between the gaps in the slap-dash wrapping, and oozing out alongside was a dark, unsightly ooze.
“I don’t feel a thing,” Mandri muttered as he turned it over, marveling at the incongruity between sight and feeling. Indeed, he felt nothing at all, not only an absence of pain, but an absence of anger, too—these bandits had cut off his hand and he didn’t much care, though that probably had something to do with Ayram’s intimidating presence.
“That’s good,” said Ayram.
“It’s bad,” the witch corrected. “He must feel the hand to work it.”
“It’s no matter,” said Ayram, inflecting his words with encouragement as he set his own great hand upon Mandri’s shoulder. He then turned Mandri around to face Obo and the rest of the Ayramun.
“I want you to command it,” he said. “You have been made this Mazid’s Minder. Command it to kneel to me. If you command it to do anything other than kneel, I’m going to crush your spine.”
Ayram’s hand shifted to the back of Mandri’s neck. The calloused weight of it swallowed Mandri’s own soft and sinewy self, and when Ayram gave a slight, yet terrifying squeeze, Mandri nearly yelped.
“So, I just…tell him to kneel?”
“Yes.”
Mandri had seen a Minder only once before, and that was a fleeting glimpse. He’d never seen a Minder voice a command. His own word was never enough to compel anyone to do anything, so why it should work now was a mystery. 
“Tell the creature to kneel,” Ayram urged.
Obo’s pale skin was blinding in the brightness of noon-day sun. Mandri stared, and like some god-touched idiot he tried to summon some guiding sensation which might uncover some hidden instinct, if indeed he had been endowed with such a thing, but all he felt was the weight of Ayram’s hand on the back of his neck. 
He took a deep breath, steadied himself, and hoping to get it over with, he issued a soft but direct, “Kneel.” It was a command, but a pleading one, almost apologetic. While that was the only kind of command that Mandri respected, it did not have the desired effect. Obo did not move. Instead, he cocked his ear and asked, “Could you say that again? I didn’t quite catch your meaning.”
Mandri risked an over-the-shoulder glance at the giant who towered up behind him. All he could see of Ayram’s head from this angle was that bread-loaf beard, as well as a sharp nose poking out it. 
Mandri muttered, “It seems he doesn’t want to kneel.”
Ayram squeezed Mandri neck again and bellowed, “That was no command. Puff out your chest! Say it with conviction. Think of yourself as a fat Junkite Queen hungry for meat.”
Before Mandri could do any of this, the witch Elrahet ambled into view. Her knees slapped the black tatters of her robe, sending the robe’s ragged hem swinging to and fro. Her eyes still fretted over Mandri’s figure. She stood before him, between him and Obo, and she waved Ayram away with a flick of her knobby fingers. The giant grunted but obeyed.
Then she began to circle Mandri as a vulture circles its meal. As she moved she mumbled a guttural speech devoid of natural pauses where she might take a breath, and this flow of mumblings had a stupefying effect, such that Mandri felt his thoughts and feelings leave him. By the second circling he was so far removed from the moment that he almost didn’t see the witch’s right hand plunge into her ragged robes and emerge with a curved, golden knife.
It was a knife he had seen before.
In fact, it looked exactly like the knife that the demon witch Pel had used to slaughter Gil.
“Stare at the Mazid,” Elrahet growled when she noticed him noticing her. “Think of nothing but the Mazid.”
Mandri’s eyes instinctively flicked to Obo, but thinking of him was difficult to do because he had seen Elrahet lick her withered lips at the sight of his stomach. And she was holding that accursed knife. It was  in the light of the sun.
“Look at the Mazid!” Elrahet snipped. “Nothing but the Mazid! Nothing but the Mazid.”
She lashed out with her blade faster than Mandri could flinch, and the blade sliced the air right in front of his belly-button. Mandri stiffened, an involuntary jerk, and now it was clear that this witch was ensorcelling him through her speech. He could actually feel Elrahet’s grating words pulling his mind down out of its perch and into a pleasant quietness, where nothing existed but the sight of Obo. It was an effect he had felt before when he’d sipped too much juice from a rotted bushel of black-spotted burgeons, it was a narrowing of the world between Mandri and his object of interest. But the witch was not done. She continued to circle, and every time her mumblings crescendoed into a witchy bark, she’d lash out with her blade and slash the air just above Mandri’s skin—above his arm, his shoulder, right in front of his nose—and each time Mandri felt some part of himself snap, as if every time she cut the air she cut one of his desires, unmooring his mind from the future so that it would drop a little further down into this trance. Soon it seemed that the only functional parts of him were his legs, which kept him standing, and his vision, though that, too, was blurring, as the limestone pit had dissolved into a whitish pucker behind Obo’s unfinished face.
A strange, bald face.
It needed eyebrows.
“Command it to kneel,” Elrahet snarled. “Shout it!”
An urge bubbled up out of Mandri’s gut and he vomited out a shout, “Kneel!”
The word that flew out of his mouth was not his own, or at least it seemed that way to his inner ear. He supposed it was magic, for the word shivered the sand underneath his feet, and a cool air blew up from nowhere and billowed the hem of his robe. And more than that, when the word passed out of his throat it wrenched at the Spark inside his stomach, and he wheezed as his insides twisted, doubling him over in pain.
When he caught his breath he looked up, and Obo was still standing, watching him. The effort seemed to amused him. “Come now, Mandri,” he said with a relaxed smile. “If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
Ayram’s great hand gripped Mandri’s shoulder again and straightened him out.
“Again.”
Mandri clutched his stomach and nearly fainted.
“Feel for your hand,” Elrahet stressed as she waddled again into view. “You must use your hand. Feel for the pulse in your fingers and squeeze.” She motioned for Mandri to raise his arm and he did, he held that weedy poultice out before him as she began again to circle. He struggled against the witch’s mumblings as they dragged him back down into her thrall. He aimed his handless wrist at the Obo as if it were a weapon, and his mind ricocheted off the monstrous thought that his movements were not his own and he plunged into a vision of his severed hand stuck inside Obo’s chest. His pale, dead fingers were squeezing a malformed slug of muscle that passed for a heart.
“KNEEL!” He  screamed, and the concussive word rattled the pit’s chalky walls then rebounded right back at him, shaking his own hardened heart in its cage and speeding into the cave behind, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back out. That this powerful shout had come from him was the least incredible thing, for the air between himself and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if his very shout had somehow thwacked the dusty ground between like an invisible whip.
Obo’s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether, and for a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Mandri’s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. 
“Almost!” said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had stolen all of Mandri’s strength. He wobbled and collapsed to his knees for his insides felt like they had imploded.
“Oh,” said Obo, a smirk playing on his lips. “Is that what you wanted me to do?”
Mandri couldn’t breathe. He floundered in the sand, gasping.
Ayram strolled right on by and glowered over pale little Obo.
“Why are you not kneeling?”
Obo stood defiant. “I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
Ayram pointed down at Mandri. “He is your Minder, yes?”
“He is,” Obo answered.
“Then why are you not kneeling?”
“His will is weak,” Obo said as if it were a matter of obvious fact.
Mandri buried his face into the crook of his arm as he cowered against the gawking stares of the Ayramun.
“In truth,” said Obo, “A Minder cannot command a Mazid to do anything. A Minder cannot command me, but they can stop me from doing something they don’t want me to do.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then said, “What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which.”
“Think of a Minder’s connection to a Mazid as a leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash as much as possible, and with a short leash, yes, there is some measure of control, but our Mandri does not have the right style of will for it. With him, my leash is quite long.”
Ayram took time to chew on Obo’s words, then said to Obo, “Why haven’t you split us all with Mazidfire?”
“Mazidfire requires a Minder with the will to wield it. I have no control of it.”
Ayram stared blankly at Obo, weighing his words, then finally and said, “Someone toss me a dagger.”
A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram’s feet. Ayram picked it up, and the blade was no bigger than a butterknife when compared to Ayram’s hand. The giant set the blade’s edge up tight against the side of Obo’s neck.
“Kneel,” he said brusquely.
Obo was unmoved. “Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from my new Minder.”
Ayram rotated the dagger so that its sharp point was digging into Obo’s white skin. “If you don’t do what I want, then I have no use for you.”
“Is it Mazidfire you want?”
“It is. But kneeling will do for now.”
“Then I suggest you direct your attention towards your choice of Minder.”
Ayram pushed the dagger’s tip into Obo’s flesh, more in curiosity than cruelty. It was a scene reminiscent of some sword-swallower’s trick—the blade was inches deep in Obo’s neck, and while Obo’s whole body was tense his face was completely unconcerned. And when Ayram withdrew the blade, only a few drops of blood trickled out from the wound.
Elrahet stepped forth once again and cleared her throat. “If the boy can’t control the creature, I will find someone who will.” 
Ayram shrugged her away and he began to pace back and forth, slowly. His left hand clasped his right behind his back, and his right hand twirled the bone-handled blade like a toothpick in between dexterous fingers. It was a grand show of hard thinking, one which went on for far too long, though everyone was keen to indulge it. Eventually he stopped right before Mandri’s downcast face—the toes of Ayram’s leather boots were nearly the width of Mandri’s own head.
“You are free to speak,” said Ayram.
Mandri lay silent, then looked up and asked, “What do you want me to say.”
“I want you to tell me what’s wrong with you. Have you got a black Spark? Were you always soft, or did dying do that to you? It couldn’t have been a bad death because you’re all in once piece.”
When Mandri didn’t answer, Ayram squatted down so that his great head blocked out the sun.
“You ever killed anyone before?”
Mandri shook his head no.
“You ever killed a goat? A pig? Anything bigger than a rat?”
“I was a painter.”
Ayram sighed and stood back up.
“Of course you were. And did my people explain to you what this is all about?”
“No.”
“I need you to do something for me. I need you to use that Mazid to do something for me.”
“Do what?”
“I need you to summon Mazidfire to kill a demon. You know what a demon is, don’t you?”
Mandri nodded.
“It’s not just any demon. It is the demon of demons. It is a beast called the Amalgamete. If you are unwilling or unable to kill it, then I will find some other poke to be this Mazid’s Minder, and making a new Minder means killing the current one.”
Mandri took a deep breath and tried to adjust himself to this new reality. 
“Why choose me in the first place?”
“I didn’t,” said Ayram as he set his frustrated gaze upon Elrahet. “She did.” 
“I may interject,” said Obo. “I have a potential solution to this little quandary we all find ourselves in.” 
“Do you?” Ayram asked, feigning interest.
“It seems that I have something you want, and you happen to have something I want.”
“What I want you can’t give. You said so yourself.”
“Yes, it is true that given present circumstances, I cannot control my fire, but if circumstances were to change…”
“Get to the point, Mazid.”
“Very well. How about a bargain?”
A few chuckles rose from the Ayramun, and Mandri thought he knew why—Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his.
“I don’t bargain with Hrks,” Ayram said bluntly.
“Then don’t call it bargaining. We’ll share gestures of goodwill. We can start small, if you like. I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don’t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. Give me a mouthful of water and I will kneel. I will grovel, if you like.”
“How is this going to get me Mazidfire?”
“I guarantee you, I will kill whatever you want if you give me what I want.”
“That so?”
“It is.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the nearby Ayramun and demanded their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram snatched it out of the air, and he unplugged the cork and took a drink. His beard bulged as he swished the water around his mouth, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he wondered aloud, “I didn’t know the Mazidai needed water.”
“We don’t,” Obo answered. “Again, this is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of goodwill.”
“You first,” said Ayram. “Give us a gesture of goodwill, to demonstrate the principle.”
Obo promptly dropped to one knee and bowed his head. And there was no mockery in it—this bend of body and limb was honest, pure obeisance.
“Beautiful,” Ayram mused as he took a moment to appreciate the gesture. “But it goes against my nature to give water to a Hrk.”
He let the statement hang in the air, and when Obo raised his eyes in aggravation, Ayram tossed the waterskin. A chorus of mumbled grumbles sounded out as the waterskin, that sign of goodwill, flew through the air and landed against Obo’s genuflecting knee. Ayram silenced his people’s complaints with a glare, meanwhile Obo simply nodded his thanks and set the skin aside.
“So what will it be, then?” Ayram asked. “What will you take in exchange for hunting a beast?”
“I want my freedom.”
Ayram’s laugh was a bellowing slap—“Hah!”. And when the sound finished ringing around the pit, he said with magnanimous charm, “Kill the Amalgamete, and I’ll let you run into whatever hole you like.”
“No holes,” said Obo. “I wish to be rid of the pseudospark which dwells inside my stomach. I wish to be freed from the Minder’s will which beats my heart. If I had my own bright Spark, then my body and will would be my own. Give this to me, and I would use my fire to kill whoever, or whatever, you wish.”
Ayram’s brow jumped into an incredulous arc. “I’ve been mistaken for a god before, but never Solraheen Himself. Forge a Divine Spark? That’s impossible.”
Obo pointed to Mandri. “I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into that boy’s body, so I know it is possible.”
All eyes swiveled to Mandri, who still lay sprawled in the center of the circle. He shrank within his robe against the onslaught of spiteful glares.
“If you could infuse Mandri’s corpse with a Spark, then do the same for me.”
Ayram turned to his scarecrow witch. “Tell the Mazid that it’s impossible.”
Elrahet had been standing perfectly still through all of this. Her eyes and mind lingered a pinky finger longer on Mandri, then, in an unsettling turn, they flicked away to scour Obo.
“I cleansed the boy’s Spark,” she said gruffly. “I did not breathe him a new one.”
“It can’t be done,” said Ayram firmly.
“I did not say it could not be done,” Elrahet growled as her hand twisted tight on the knobby head of her sand-smoothed cane. To Mandri’s great surprise, she even savored a sneer at her leader. “A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require a sacrifice greater than any here can summon. Better to wring the will out of the boy. That, or we find another Minder.”
“Agreed,” said Ayram before turning to Obo and adding, “Even if she could do it, we cannot trust you.” Then he beckoned to his followers and barked, “Moto and Tob! Come hold it flat.”
Big bush Tob stood up. The other man, Moto, was an athletic Zosan. They both hurried over to the kneeling Obo. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand. Tob threw punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. 
“Settle down Tob,” Ayram griped after Tob spat up a chunk of smoke-blacked spit onto Obo’s face. Tob grinned at Ayram’s chiding remark, though he did settle down as Ayram wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar.
This bar was one solid piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head. At its top, the iron splayed out into a chisel, while at the bottom, the iron belled out into a sphere the size of Ayram’s giant fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled the bar once as if it were as light as an oilwood spear.
“If I can’t make you kneel on my own terms,” he said to Obo, “Then you won’t need your legs.”
He marched towards Obo with menace in his step.
“There’s no need for this,” Obo protested, but Ayram was a man who could be moved. He said, “If the Minder can’t mind, then what’s there to stop you from running away when no one’s looking? No. We’ll all be more comfortable this way.”
He raised his spear above Obo’s thigh, and Mandri shut his eyes.
While Mandri could hide from the sight of such a gruesome affair, he could not hide from the sound. When the chisel-head stabbed into Obo’s flesh it snapped the bone.
But Obo did not cry out. Mandri, stunned, sneaked a peek, and there nearby was the Zosan, Moto, steadying Obo’s left hip as he hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons. They repeated this work on Obo’s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.
Through it all, Obo made no sound, and when it was over, and he was legless, Ayram raised his iron bar and shouted, “Someone bag the Mazid up! Bag everything up. It’s time to walk. That damned Amalgamete ain’t coming to us.”
All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled past Mandri and into the darkness of the cave. Forty stopped at Mandri’s side and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked, he glanced back towards Obo, whose blood-stub of a body was a frightful sight laying there in the sand, and just as Mandri’s heart was strafed by the shame of somehow having caused all this, Obo caught his eye, smiled, and gave him another wink, before promptly shutting his eyes for another long spell of pretending to be unconscious.</Text>

        <Title>Elrahet is Injected</Title>
        <Text>Mandri stretched out his legs in a futile attempt to recover from the rigor of death. He wanted to stand up and walk around, but he was forced by circumstance to sit and wait in the bottom of the Ayramun’s limestone pit. He watched the sun as it crossed over to noon, such that its light shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. By then, most of the Ayramun had retreated into the tunnel. Forty stayed to keep watch over Mandri, and Mandri stayed because he thought he was supposed to. But he preferred the warmth. He set his back against the rock and shut his eyes, and he had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd of brown ragged pokes came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, away from Mandri, chattering excitedly like children. 
Mandri watched them blather, tried to pick up some hints about what was going on, then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention.
Out of the shadowed tunnel came Ayram.
Mandri had never seen a man so big.
He’d seen giants in paintings, but those were paintings. Those giants were Hrkan Lords painted to be twice their actual size, an unreality meant to lift up ordinary rulers in the eyes of their subjects. It was a genre known as ‘the conquering hero’, and it was a tired genre, a joke even amongst the Lords who knew they were ordinary men. And Mandri agreed. He’d never once spared an admiring thought for these men. The first thought that came to Mandri’s mind when he saw Ayram was, ‘Oh, shit,’ and the second was the more considered, ‘This must be Arnaggu’.
Arnaggu was the first Hrkan Lord, a true conquering hero, the inspiration for the genre. In some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towered above the windswept Forni plain. It was a terrifying piece. The relief itself sat four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicted stretched all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image was a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen dressed in the garb of slaves—naked torsos and skirted hips. Their limbs are splayed out like flattened lizards. Their faces are fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu’s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is depicted ten times larger than any other, and he stood at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage. His upper torso and head were the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seemed to be tearing himself out of the rock, eyes wild but brow untroubled, the look of royal rage, as if he’d just heard whispers of rebellion and was dead-set on cutting out the treacherous tongues with his blade.
Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen, and at first blush a prickling sense of awe stippled his skin. To contend with Arnaggu was to contend with the entirety of the rock.
Ayram looked like Arnaggu reborn, a true giant, with a stern countenance seemingly carved from stone. His hair was wrapped up in a black headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, black, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet Unkileen, who was himself named after a mountain. Ayram wasn’t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens. And the way he moved, with his too-long legs wrapped in faded black wool and swinging in a loping gait, he seemed possessed of that skinny-legged power that hides inside a horse.
Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, the man carried the body of a conquered wretch under his arm. This was none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo, whose bald head was twisted the right way around. Obo’s silver eyes blinked in the sun, and set against Ayram’s bronzed skin and black robes, his naked, chalk-white flesh was gleaming.
Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him. All of them stared at their master’s capture like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for a greasy hand to divvy up the meal. The awkward nakedness of Obo’s  body drew hearty jeers. Weeg was quick to point out that this Mazid didn’t have an asshole.
“No wonder he acts like his shit don’t stink,” he said, smirking.
“It do when it come out the mouth,” said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.
“Bet it does!” Tob roared. He then slapped his knee and killed the joke by hitting it square in the face. “Shit comes out its mouth because its full of shit!”
His belly-rumbling laugh was followed by a storm of obscenities that rained down upon poor Obo—almost all the Ayramun joined in. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.
Obo bore their insults with the bearing of a bullied child who’d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo stood up and smiled, almost gloating, and this triggered a roar of fury and renewed calls for the Obo’s head on a spike.
Ayram settled his people down with a shrill and sharp two-fingered whistle. 
He then turned to the cave from which he’d come and he shouted, “Elrahet!”.
His voice was deep and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous chest, and already echoed before they’d even left his lips, giving the unsettling impression that two men spoke at once..
An old woman’s voice came grumbling back from the cave.
“Sol’s light, I’m coming.”
A witch came hobbling out of the dark, clouded in a mass of ruffled black tatters, and leaning on a thigh-high cane of withered driftwood. She kept her shawled head downcast in deference, and with her spine as bowed as it was, she was no taller than Ayram’s hip.
She joined the Ayramun’s circle, completing it. As soon as she was settled, Ayram worked his piercing gaze upon the rest of his people, and eventually his eyes landed on Mandri.
“And you,” he said, “Come here.”
Forty pushed Mandri up, and whispered, “Go on.”
Mandri scuffled across the sand, passed a smirking Obo, and he stood before the giant, suddenly aware that everyone’s eyes were on him.
“What’s your name, boy?”
“Mandri.”
“Look at me, Mandri.”
Mandri looked up and tried to find Ayram’s eyes against a backdrop of blue-bright sky.
“You been crying, boy? ”
Mandri shook his head.
“Why are your eyes are red and witless, puffy?”
The old witch stepped forward, steadied herself on her gnarled cane and said, “His body has not yet recovered from death. His face is still stuffed with blood.” The shadow of her cowl hid a sneering squint that folded so much age around her eyes that the eyes themselves were little more than black seeds thumb-pressed into her sockets. And those seeds were moving, they flitted underneath those wrinkles, studying the outline of Mandri’s figure as if they could see the smell of death exuding out from him. Eventually they fixed on his wounded arm.
“How is it?” she asked flatly.
Mandri raised his poulticed wrist. The sight of it alone was sickening, for the once-white linen was stained brown and black, and tufts of rotted vegetative matter sprouted out between the gaps in the slap-dash wrapping, and oozing out alongside was a dark, unsightly ooze.
“I don’t feel a thing,” Mandri muttered as he turned it over, marveling at the incongruity between sight and feeling. Indeed, he felt nothing at all, not only an absence of pain, but an absence of anger, too—these bandits had cut off his hand and he didn’t much care, though that probably had something to do with Ayram’s intimidating presence.
“That’s good,” said Ayram.
“It’s bad,” the witch corrected. “He must feel the hand to work it.”
“It’s no matter,” said Ayram, inflecting his words with encouragement as he set his own great hand upon Mandri’s shoulder. He then turned Mandri around to face Obo and the rest of the Ayramun.
“I want you to command it,” he said. “You have been made this Mazid’s Minder. Command it to kneel to me. If you command it to do anything other than kneel, I’m going to crush your spine.”
Ayram’s hand shifted to the back of Mandri’s neck. The calloused weight of it swallowed Mandri’s own soft and sinewy self, and when Ayram gave a slight, yet terrifying squeeze, Mandri nearly yelped.
“So, I just…tell him to kneel?”
“Yes.”
Mandri had seen a Minder only once before, and that was a fleeting glimpse. He’d never seen a Minder voice a command. His own word was never enough to compel anyone to do anything, so why it should work now was a mystery. 
“Tell the creature to kneel,” Ayram urged.
Obo’s pale skin was blinding in the brightness of noon-day sun. Mandri stared, and like some god-touched idiot he tried to summon some guiding sensation which might uncover some hidden instinct, if indeed he had been endowed with such a thing, but all he felt was the weight of Ayram’s hand on the back of his neck. 
He took a deep breath, steadied himself, and hoping to get it over with, he issued a soft but direct, “Kneel.” It was a command, but a pleading one, almost apologetic. While that was the only kind of command that Mandri respected, it did not have the desired effect. Obo did not move. Instead, he cocked his ear and asked, “Could you say that again? I didn’t quite catch your meaning.”
Mandri risked an over-the-shoulder glance at the giant who towered up behind him. All he could see of Ayram’s head from this angle was that bread-loaf beard, as well as a sharp nose poking out it. 
Mandri muttered, “It seems he doesn’t want to kneel.”
Ayram squeezed Mandri neck again and bellowed, “That was no command. Puff out your chest! Say it with conviction. Think of yourself as a fat Junkite Queen hungry for meat.”
Before Mandri could do any of this, the witch Elrahet ambled into view. Her knees slapped the black tatters of her robe, sending the robe’s ragged hem swinging to and fro. Her eyes still fretted over Mandri’s figure. She stood before him, between him and Obo, and she waved Ayram away with a flick of her knobby fingers. The giant grunted but obeyed.
Then she began to circle Mandri as a vulture circles its meal. As she moved she mumbled a guttural speech devoid of natural pauses where she might take a breath, and this flow of mumblings had a stupefying effect, such that Mandri felt his thoughts and feelings leave him. By the second circling he was so far removed from the moment that he almost didn’t see the witch’s right hand plunge into her ragged robes and emerge with a curved, golden knife.
It was a knife he had seen before.
In fact, it looked exactly like the knife that the demon witch Pel had used to slaughter Gil.
“Stare at the Mazid,” Elrahet growled when she noticed him noticing her. “Think of nothing but the Mazid.”
Mandri’s eyes instinctively flicked to Obo, but thinking of him was difficult to do because he had seen Elrahet lick her withered lips at the sight of his stomach. And she was holding that accursed knife. It was  in the light of the sun.
“Look at the Mazid!” Elrahet snipped. “Nothing but the Mazid! Nothing but the Mazid.”
She lashed out with her blade faster than Mandri could flinch, and the blade sliced the air right in front of his belly-button. Mandri stiffened, an involuntary jerk, and now it was clear that this witch was ensorcelling him through her speech. He could actually feel Elrahet’s grating words pulling his mind down out of its perch and into a pleasant quietness, where nothing existed but the sight of Obo. It was an effect he had felt before when he’d sipped too much juice from a rotted bushel of black-spotted burgeons, it was a narrowing of the world between Mandri and his object of interest. But the witch was not done. She continued to circle, and every time her mumblings crescendoed into a witchy bark, she’d lash out with her blade and slash the air just above Mandri’s skin—above his arm, his shoulder, right in front of his nose—and each time Mandri felt some part of himself snap, as if every time she cut the air she cut one of his desires, unmooring his mind from the future so that it would drop a little further down into this trance. Soon it seemed that the only functional parts of him were his legs, which kept him standing, and his vision, though that, too, was blurring, as the limestone pit had dissolved into a whitish pucker behind Obo’s unfinished face.
A strange, bald face.
It needed eyebrows.
“Command it to kneel,” Elrahet snarled. “Shout it!”
An urge bubbled up out of Mandri’s gut and he vomited out a shout, “Kneel!”
The word that flew out of his mouth was not his own, or at least it seemed that way to his inner ear. He supposed it was magic, for the word shivered the sand underneath his feet, and a cool air blew up from nowhere and billowed the hem of his robe. And more than that, when the word passed out of his throat it wrenched at the Spark inside his stomach, and he wheezed as his insides twisted, doubling him over in pain.
When he caught his breath he looked up, and Obo was still standing, watching him. The effort seemed to amused him. “Come now, Mandri,” he said with a relaxed smile. “If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
Ayram’s great hand gripped Mandri’s shoulder again and straightened him out.
“Again.”
Mandri clutched his stomach and nearly fainted.
“Feel for your hand,” Elrahet stressed as she waddled again into view. “You must use your hand. Feel for the pulse in your fingers and squeeze.” She motioned for Mandri to raise his arm and he did, he held that weedy poultice out before him as she began again to circle. He struggled against the witch’s mumblings as they dragged him back down into her thrall. He aimed his handless wrist at the Obo as if it were a weapon, and his mind ricocheted off the monstrous thought that his movements were not his own and he plunged into a vision of his severed hand stuck inside Obo’s chest. His pale, dead fingers were squeezing a malformed slug of muscle that passed for a heart.
“KNEEL!” He  screamed, and the concussive word rattled the pit’s chalky walls then rebounded right back at him, shaking his own hardened heart in its cage and speeding into the cave behind, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back out. That this powerful shout had come from him was the least incredible thing, for the air between himself and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if his very shout had somehow thwacked the dusty ground between like an invisible whip.
Obo’s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether, and for a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Mandri’s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. 
“Almost!” said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had stolen all of Mandri’s strength. Mandri wobbled and collapsed to his knees for his insides felt like they had imploded and his handless wrist felt like it was burning.
“Oh,” said Obo, a smirk playing on his lips. “Is that what you wanted me to do?”
Mandri couldn’t breathe. He floundered in the sand, gasping.
Ayram strolled right on by and glowered over pale little Obo.
“Why are you not kneeling?” he asked the Mazid.
Obo stood defiant. “I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
Ayram pointed down at Mandri. “He is your Minder, yes?”
“He is.”
“Then why are you not kneeling?”
“His will is weak,” Obo said as if it were a matter of obvious fact.
Mandri buried his face into the crook of his arm as he cowered against the gawking stares of the Ayramun. Then the old witch stepped into the circle. She hovered near Mandri, and he could feel her judge him too. She said, “A Minder cannot command a Mazid to do anything. A Minder can only forbid, never command.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then said, “What’s the difference between commanding the Mazid to kneel, and stopping it from standing? There is no difference. Have it kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which.”
Elrahet grunted. “The Minder’s connection to a Mazid is a leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash as much as possible to achieve some measure of control. Our Minder lacks the focus. With him, the leash is long.”
“Then why hasn’t the Mazid split us all with Mazidfire?”
“Mazidfire is the one thing a Minder can command. Mazidfire requires a Minder with the will to wield it. The boy does not have such will, nor will he, not until I make him ready.”
Obo was watching the witch explain with curious interest. His head was tilted, like a confused dog. He said, “How is it you know so much about me?”
Elrahet smiled and her tattered robes as she cackled. 
“Really,” said Obo, “I’d love to know.”
Ayram answered for her. “How do you think the Hrks learned to fleshcraft? Think they discovered it themselves? It was a witch who taught them.”
Ayram stared blankly at Obo, weighing the witch’s words, then finally and said, “Someone toss me a dagger.”
A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram’s feet. Ayram picked it up, and the blade was no bigger than a butterknife when compared to Ayram’s hand. The giant set the blade’s edge up tight against the side of Obo’s neck.
“Kneel,” he said brusquely.
Obo was unmoved. “Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from my new Minder.”
Ayram rotated the dagger so that its sharp point was digging into Obo’s white skin. “If you don’t do what I want, then I have no use for you.”
“Is it Mazidfire you want?”
“It is. But kneeling will do for now.”
“Then I suggest you direct your attention towards your choice of Minder.”
Ayram pushed the dagger’s tip into Obo’s flesh, more in curiosity than cruelty. It was a scene reminiscent of some sword-swallower’s trick—the blade was inches deep in Obo’s neck, and while Obo’s whole body was tense his face was completely unconcerned. And when Ayram withdrew the blade, only a few drops of blood trickled out from the wound.
Elrahet stepped forth once again and cleared her throat. “If the boy can’t control the creature, I will find someone who will.” 
Ayram shrugged her away and he began to pace back and forth, slowly. His left hand clasped his right behind his back, and his right hand twirled the bone-handled blade like a toothpick in between dexterous fingers. It was a grand show of hard thinking, one which went on for far too long, though everyone was keen to indulge it. Eventually he stopped right before Mandri’s downcast face—the toes of Ayram’s leather boots were nearly the width of Mandri’s own head.
“You are free to speak,” said Ayram.
Mandri lay silent, then looked up and asked, “What do you want me to say.”
“I want you to tell me what’s wrong with you. Have you got a black Spark? Were you always soft, or did dying do that to you? It couldn’t have been a bad death because you’re all in once piece.”
When Mandri didn’t answer, Ayram squatted down so that his great head blocked out the sun.
“You ever killed anyone before?”
Mandri shook his head no.
“You ever killed a goat? A pig? Anything bigger than a rat?”
“I was a painter.”
Ayram sighed and stood back up.
“Of course you were. And did my people explain to you what this is all about?”
“No.”
“I need you to do something for me. I need you to use that Mazid to do something for me.”
“Do what?”
“I need you to summon Mazidfire to kill a demon. You know what a demon is, don’t you?”
Mandri nodded.
“It’s not just any demon. It is the demon of demons. It is a beast called the Amalgamete. If you are unwilling or unable to kill it, then I will find some other poke to be this Mazid’s Minder, and making a new Minder means killing the current one.”
Mandri took a deep breath and tried to adjust himself to this new reality. 
“Why choose me in the first place?”
“I didn’t,” said Ayram as he set his frustrated gaze upon Elrahet. “She did.” 
“I may interject,” said Obo. “I have a potential solution to this little quandary we all find ourselves in.” 
“Do you?” Ayram asked, feigning interest.
“It seems that I have something you want, and you happen to have something I want.”
“What I want you can’t give. You said so yourself.”
“Yes, it is true that given present circumstances, I cannot control my fire, but if circumstances were to change…”
“Get to the point, Mazid.”
“Very well. How about a bargain?”
A few chuckles rose from the Ayramun, and Mandri thought he knew why—Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his.
“I don’t bargain with Hrks,” Ayram said bluntly.
“Then don’t call it bargaining. We’ll share gestures of goodwill. We can start small, if you like. I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don’t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. Give me a mouthful of water and I will kneel. I will grovel, if you like.”
“How is this going to get me Mazidfire?”
“I guarantee you, I will kill whatever you want if you give me what I want.”
“That so?”
“It is.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the nearby Ayramun and demanded their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram snatched it out of the air, and he unplugged the cork and took a drink. His beard bulged as he swished the water around his mouth, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he wondered aloud, “I didn’t know the Mazidai needed water.”
“We don’t,” Obo answered. “Again, this is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of goodwill.”
“You first,” said Ayram. “Give us a gesture of goodwill, to demonstrate the principle.”
Obo promptly dropped to one knee and bowed his head. And there was no mockery in it—this bend of body and limb was honest, pure obeisance.
“Beautiful,” Ayram mused as he took a moment to appreciate the gesture. “But it goes against my nature to give water to a Hrk.”
He let the statement hang in the air, and when Obo raised his eyes in aggravation, Ayram tossed the waterskin. A chorus of mumbled grumbles sounded out as the waterskin, that sign of goodwill, flew through the air and landed against Obo’s genuflecting knee. Ayram silenced his people’s complaints with a glare, meanwhile Obo simply nodded his thanks and set the skin aside.
“So what will it be, then?” Ayram asked. “What will you take in exchange for hunting a beast?”
“I want my freedom.”
Ayram’s laugh was a bellowing slap—“Hah!”. And when the sound finished ringing around the pit, he said with magnanimous charm, “Kill the Amalgamete, and I’ll let you run into whatever hole you like.”
“No holes,” said Obo. “I wish to be rid of the pseudospark which dwells inside my stomach. I wish to be freed from the Minder’s will which beats my heart. If I had my own bright Spark, then my body and will would be my own. Give this to me, and I would use my fire to kill whoever, or whatever, you wish.”
Ayram’s brow jumped into an incredulous arc. “I’ve been mistaken for a god before, but never Solraheen Himself. Forge a Divine Spark? That’s impossible.”
Obo pointed to Mandri. “I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into that boy’s body, so I know it is possible.”
All eyes swiveled to Mandri, who still lay sprawled in the center of the circle. He shrank within his robe against the onslaught of spiteful glares.
“If you could infuse Mandri’s corpse with a Spark, then do the same for me.”
Ayram turned to his scarecrow witch. “Tell the Mazid that it’s impossible.”
Elrahet had been standing perfectly still through all of this. Her eyes and mind lingered a pinky finger longer on Mandri, then, in an unsettling turn, they flicked away to scour Obo.
“I cleansed the boy’s Spark,” she said gruffly. “I did not breathe him a new one.”
“It can’t be done,” said Ayram firmly.
“I did not say it could not be done,” Elrahet growled as her hand twisted tight on the knobby head of her sand-smoothed cane. To Mandri’s great surprise, she even savored a sneer at her leader. “A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require a sacrifice greater than any here can summon. Better to wring the will out of the boy. That, or we find another Minder.”
“Agreed,” said Ayram before turning to Obo and adding, “Even if she could do it, we cannot trust you.” Then he beckoned to his followers and barked, “Moto and Tob! Come hold it flat.”
Big bush Tob stood up. The other man, Moto, was an athletic Zosan. They both hurried over to the kneeling Obo. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand. Tob threw punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. 
“Settle down Tob,” Ayram griped after Tob spat up a chunk of smoke-blacked spit onto Obo’s face. Tob grinned at Ayram’s chiding remark, though he did settle down as Ayram wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar.
This bar was one solid piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head. At its top, the iron splayed out into a chisel, while at the bottom, the iron belled out into a sphere the size of Ayram’s giant fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled the bar once as if it were as light as an oilwood spear.
“If I can’t make you kneel on my own terms,” he said to Obo, “Then you won’t need your legs.”
He marched towards Obo with menace in his step.
“There’s no need for this,” Obo protested, but Ayram was a man who could be moved. He said, “If the Minder can’t mind, then what’s there to stop you from running away when no one’s looking? No. We’ll all be more comfortable this way.”
He raised his spear above Obo’s thigh, and Mandri shut his eyes.
While Mandri could hide from the sight of such a gruesome affair, he could not hide from the sound. When the chisel-head stabbed into Obo’s flesh it snapped the bone.
But Obo did not cry out. Mandri, stunned, sneaked a peek, and there nearby was the Zosan, Moto, steadying Obo’s left hip as he hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons. They repeated this work on Obo’s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.
Through it all, Obo made no sound, and when it was over, and he was legless, Ayram raised his iron bar and shouted, “Someone bag the Mazid up! Bag everything up. It’s time to walk. That damned Amalgamete ain’t coming to us.”
All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled past Mandri and into the darkness of the cave. Forty stopped at Mandri’s side and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked, he glanced back towards Obo, whose blood-stub of a body was a frightful sight laying there in the sand, and just as Mandri’s heart was strafed by the shame of somehow having caused all this, Obo caught his eye, smiled, and gave him another wink, before promptly shutting his eyes for another long spell of pretending to be unconscious.</Text>

        <Title>excise Obo</Title>
        <Text>Mandri stretched out his legs in a futile attempt to recover from the rigor of death. He wanted to stand up and walk around, but he was forced by circumstance to sit and wait in the bottom of the Ayramun’s limestone pit. He watched the sun as it crossed over to noon, such that its light shone straight down into the pit, leaving no shadows in which to hide. By then, most of the Ayramun had retreated into the tunnel. Forty stayed to keep watch over Mandri, and Mandri stayed because he thought he was supposed to. But he preferred the warmth. He set his back against the rock and shut his eyes, and he had nearly fallen asleep when a crowd of brown ragged pokes came scrambling back out into the pit, about fifteen to twenty of them. They all sat down, away from Mandri, chattering excitedly like children. 
Mandri watched them blather, tried to pick up some hints about what was going on, then some hidden signal passed between them, and these sand-dusted, black-hooded, desert-beaten men and women snapped to attention.
Out of the shadowed tunnel came Ayram.
Mandri had never seen a man so big.
He’d seen giants in paintings, but those were paintings. Those giants were Hrkan Lords painted to be twice their actual size, an unreality meant to lift up ordinary rulers in the eyes of their subjects. It was a genre known as ‘the conquering hero’, and it was a tired genre, a joke even amongst the Lords who knew they were ordinary men. And Mandri agreed. He’d never once spared an admiring thought for these men. The first thought that came to Mandri’s mind when he saw Ayram was, ‘Oh, shit,’ and the second was the more considered, ‘This must be Arnaggu’.
Arnaggu was the first Hrkan Lord, a true conquering hero, the inspiration for the genre. In some ancient age his image was carved into the flat face of a massive granite monadnock that towered above the windswept Forni plain. It was a terrifying piece. The relief itself sat four-hundred feet off the ground, and the battle it depicted stretched all the way across the flat, shaven granite, some six-hundred feet wide. At the bottom of this great image was a horde of Old Jandri tribesmen dressed in the garb of slaves—naked torsos and skirted hips. Their limbs are splayed out like flattened lizards. Their faces are fixed in silent screams as they are crushed under the sandals of Arnaggu’s army, a tidal wave of men. Arnaggu himself is depicted ten times larger than any other, and he stood at the apex of the piece, wading through the carnage. His upper torso and head were the only parts of the relief carved fully in the round, such that Arnaggu seemed to be tearing himself out of the rock, eyes wild but brow untroubled, the look of royal rage, as if he’d just heard whispers of rebellion and was dead-set on cutting out the treacherous tongues with his blade.
Mandrameen saw this relief when he was sixteen, and at first blush a prickling sense of awe stippled his skin. To contend with Arnaggu was to contend with the entirety of the rock.
Ayram looked like Arnaggu reborn, a true giant, with a stern countenance seemingly carved from stone. His hair was wrapped up in a black headscarf, and his beady eyes were tucked under thick, black, mothy brows. His long, gaunt face was sunk into a bread loaf of a beard, an Old Jandri style beard called an Unky beard, named after the warrior poet Unkileen, who was himself named after a mountain. Ayram wasn’t ten-men-tall like Arnaggu, but he was nearly as tall as two whole Mandrameens. And the way he moved, with his too-long legs wrapped in faded black wool and swinging in a loping gait, he seemed possessed of that skinny-legged power that hides inside a horse.
Here was a conquering hero in the fashion of old, and true to the form, the man carried the body of a conquered wretch under his arm. This was none other than the pale and misshapen Mazidobo, whose bald head was twisted the right way around. Obo’s silver eyes blinked in the sun, and set against Ayram’s bronzed skin and black robes, his naked, chalk-white flesh was gleaming.
Ayram tossed Obo into the sunny sand in the center of the pit, and the rest of the Ayramun formed a distant ring around him. All of them stared at their master’s capture like a pack of whipped hounds waiting for a greasy hand to divvy up the meal. The awkward nakedness of Obo’s body drew hearty jeers. Weeg was quick to point out that this Mazid didn’t have an asshole.
“No wonder he acts like his shit don’t stink,” he said, smirking.
“It do when it come out the mouth,” said another hardscrabble bloke with a voice like a bucket of rocks.
“Bet it does!” Tob roared. He then slapped his knee and killed the joke by hitting it square in the face. “Shit comes out its mouth because it's full of shit!”
His belly-rumbling laugh was followed by a storm of obscenities that rained down upon poor Obo—almost all the Ayramun joined in. Ayram stood silent, arms crossed, eyes delighting in realized vengeance.
Obo bore their insults with the bearing of a bullied child who’d heard it all before. When the Ayramun inevitably tired themselves out, Obo stood up and smiled, almost gloating, and this triggered a roar of fury and renewed calls for the Obo’s head on a spike.
Ayram settled his people down with a shrill and sharp two-fingered whistle. 
He then turned to the cave from which he’d come and he shouted, “Elrahet!”.
His voice was deep and sonorous, as only the manliest tones could claw their way out of his cavernous chest, and already echoed before they’d even left his lips, giving the unsettling impression that two men spoke at once..
An old woman’s voice came grumbling back from the cave.
“Sol’s light, I’m coming.”
A witch came hobbling out of the dark, clouded in a mass of ruffled black tatters, and leaning on a thigh-high cane of withered driftwood. She kept her shawled head downcast in deference, and with her spine as bowed as it was, she was no taller than Ayram’s hip.
She joined the Ayramun’s circle, completing it. As soon as she was settled, Ayram worked his piercing gaze upon the rest of his people, and eventually his eyes landed on Mandri.
“And you,” he said, “Come here.”
Forty pushed Mandri up, and whispered, “Go on.”
Mandri scuffled across the sand, passed a smirking Obo, and he stood before the giant, suddenly aware that everyone’s eyes were on him.
“What’s your name, boy?”
“Mandri.”
“Look at me, Mandri.”
Mandri looked up and tried to find Ayram’s eyes against a backdrop of blue-bright sky.
“You been crying, boy? ”
Mandri shook his head.
“Why are your eyes red and witless, puffy?”
The old witch stepped forward, steadied herself on her gnarled cane and said, “His body has not yet recovered from death. His face is still stuffed with blood.” The shadow of her cowl hid a sneering squint that folded so much age around her eyes that the eyes themselves were little more than black seeds thumb-pressed into her sockets. And those seeds were moving, they flitted underneath those wrinkles, studying the outline of Mandri’s figure as if they could see the smell of death exuding out from him. Eventually they fixed on his wounded arm.
“How is it?” she asked flatly.
Mandri raised his poulticed wrist. The sight of it alone was sickening, for the once-white linen was stained brown and black, and tufts of rotted vegetative matter sprouted out between the gaps in the slap-dash wrapping, and oozing out alongside was a dark, unsightly ooze.
“I don’t feel a thing,” Mandri muttered as he turned it over, marveling at the incongruity between sight and feeling. Indeed, he felt nothing at all, not only an absence of pain, but an absence of anger, too—these bandits had cut off his hand and he didn’t much care, though that probably had something to do with Ayram’s intimidating presence.
“That’s good,” said Ayram.
“It’s bad,” the witch corrected. “He must feel the hand to work it.”
“It’s no matter,” said Ayram, inflecting his words with encouragement as he set his own great hand upon Mandri’s shoulder. He then turned Mandri around to face Obo and the rest of the Ayramun.
“I want you to command it,” he said. “You have been made this Mazid’s Minder. Command it to kneel to me. If you command it to do anything other than kneel, I’m going to crush your spine.”
Ayram’s hand shifted to the back of Mandri’s neck. The calloused weight of it swallowed Mandri’s own soft and sinewy self, and when Ayram gave a slight, yet terrifying squeeze, Mandri nearly yelped.
“So, I just…tell him to kneel?”
“Yes.”
Mandri had seen a Minder only once before, and that was a fleeting glimpse. He’d never seen a Minder voice a command. His own word was never enough to compel anyone to do anything, so why it should work now was a mystery. 
“Tell the creature to kneel,” Ayram urged.
Obo’s pale skin was blinding in the brightness of noon-day sun. Mandri stared, and like some god-touched idiot he tried to summon some guiding sensation which might uncover some hidden instinct, if indeed he had been endowed with such a thing, but all he felt was the weight of Ayram’s hand on the back of his neck. 
He took a deep breath, steadied himself, and hoping to get it over with, he issued a soft but direct, “Kneel.” It was a command, but a pleading one, almost apologetic. While that was the only kind of command that Mandri respected, it did not have the desired effect. Obo did not move. Instead, he cocked his ear and asked, “Could you say that again? I didn’t quite catch your meaning.”
Mandri risked an over-the-shoulder glance at the giant who towered up behind him. All he could see of Ayram’s head from this angle was that bread-loaf beard, as well as a sharp nose poking out.
Mandri muttered, “It seems he doesn’t want to kneel.”
Ayram squeezed Mandri neck again and bellowed, “That was no command. Puff out your chest! Say it with conviction. Think of yourself as a fat Junkite Queen hungry for meat.”
Before Mandri could do any of this, the witch Elrahet ambled into view. Her knees slapped the black tatters of her robe, sending the robe’s ragged hem swinging to and fro. Her eyes still fretted over Mandri’s figure. She stood before him, between him and Obo, and she waved Ayram away with a flick of her knobby fingers. The giant grunted but obeyed.
Then she began to circle Mandri as a vulture circles its meal. As she moved she mumbled a guttural speech devoid of natural pauses where she might take a breath, and this flow of mumblings had a stupefying effect, such that Mandri felt his thoughts and feelings leave him. By the second circling he was so far removed from the moment that he almost didn’t see the witch’s right hand plunge into her ragged robes and emerge with a curved, golden knife.
It was a knife he had seen before.
In fact, it looked exactly like the knife that the demon witch Pel had used to slaughter Gil.
“Stare at the Mazid,” Elrahet growled when she noticed him noticing her. “Think of nothing but the Mazid.”
Mandri’s eyes instinctively flicked to Obo, but thinking of him was difficult to do because he had seen Elrahet lick her withered lips at the sight of his stomach. And she was holding that accursed knife. It was in the light of the sun.
“Look at the Mazid!” Elrahet snipped. “Nothing but the Mazid! Nothing but the Mazid.”
She lashed out with her blade faster than Mandri could flinch, and the blade sliced the air right in front of his belly-button. Mandri stiffened, an involuntary jerk, and now it was clear that this witch was ensorcelling him through her speech. He could actually feel Elrahet’s grating words pulling his mind down out of its perch and into a pleasant quietness, where nothing existed but the sight of Obo. It was an effect he had felt before when he’d sipped too much juice from a rotted bushel of black-spotted burgeons, it was a narrowing of the world between Mandri and his object of interest. But the witch was not done. She continued to circle, and every time her mumblings crescendoed into a witchy bark, she’d lash out with her blade and slash the air just above Mandri’s skin—above his arm, his shoulder, right in front of his nose—and each time Mandri felt some part of himself snap, as if every time she cut the air she cut one of his desires, unmooring his mind from the future so that it would drop a little further down into this trance. Soon it seemed that the only functional parts of him were his legs, which kept him standing, and his vision, though that, too, was blurring, as the limestone pit had dissolved into a whitish pucker behind Obo’s unfinished face.
A strange, bald face.
It needed eyebrows.
“Command it to kneel,” Elrahet snarled. “Shout it!”
An urge bubbled up out of Mandri’s gut and he vomited out a shout, “Kneel!”
The word that flew out of his mouth was not his own, or at least it seemed that way to his inner ear. He supposed it was magic, for the word shivered the sand underneath his feet, and a cool air blew up from nowhere and billowed the hem of his robe. And more than that, when the word passed out of his throat it wrenched at the Spark inside his stomach, and he wheezed as his insides twisted, doubling him over in pain.
When he caught his breath he looked up, and Obo was still standing, watching him. The effort seemed to amuse him. “Come now, Mandri,” he said with a relaxed smile. “If you could command me, you could do it with a whisper.”
Ayram’s great hand gripped Mandri’s shoulder again and straightened him out.
“Again.”
Mandri clutched his stomach and nearly fainted.
“Feel for your hand,” Elrahet stressed as she waddled again into view. “You must use your hand. Feel for the pulse in your fingers and squeeze.” She motioned for Mandri to raise his arm and he did, he held that weedy poultice out before him as she began again to circle. He struggled against the witch’s mumblings as they dragged him back down into her thrall. He aimed his handless wrist at the Obo as if it were a weapon, and his mind ricocheted off the monstrous thought that his movements were not his own and he plunged into a vision of his severed hand stuck inside Obo’s chest. His pale, dead fingers were squeezing a malformed slug of muscle that passed for a heart.
“KNEEL!” He screamed, and the concussive word rattled the pit’s chalky walls then rebounded right back at him, shaking his own hardened heart in its cage and speeding into the cave behind, echoing into unseen corridors, slamming into every dead end, sending faint rejoinders back out. That this powerful shout had come from him was the least incredible thing, for the air between himself and the Mazid was alive with a sprinkling of sand, as if his very shout had somehow thwacked the dusty ground between like an invisible whip.
Obo’s shoulders jerked downwards, pulled by an unseen tether, and for a moment, it seemed as if he would kneel, but when the last echoing remnants of the Mandri’s command faded out of the air, the tension snapped, and Obo was still standing. 
“Almost!” said Obo, clearly surprised by the effort, an effort which had stolen all of Mandri’s strength. Mandri wobbled and collapsed to his knees for his insides felt like they had imploded and his handless wrist felt like it was burning.
“Oh,” said Obo, a smirk playing on his lips. “Is that what you wanted me to do?”
Mandri couldn’t breathe. He floundered in the sand, gasping.
Ayram strolled right on by and glowered over pale little Obo.
“Why are you not kneeling?” he asked the Mazid.
Obo stood defiant. “I’m not kneeling because I don’t want to.”
Ayram pointed down at Mandri. “He is your Minder, yes?”
“He is.”
“Then why are you not kneeling?”
“His will is weak,” Obo said as if it were a matter of obvious fact.
Mandri buried his face into the crook of his arm as he cowered against the gawking stares of the Ayramun.
“In truth,” said Obo, “A Minder cannot command a Mazid to do anything. A Minder can only stop me from doing something they don’t want me to do.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then said, “What’s the difference between commanding you to kneel, and stopping you from standing? There is no difference. Kneel, or stop standing, I don’t care which.”
There was another pause, and when Mandri peeked out he saw Obo’s face wrinkled in amusement. Obo said, “If you are unsatisfied, you can always try again, but I tell you, you’ve chosen the wrong man to be Minder.”
Ayram spun around. Mandri cringed, fearing the giant’s boot would come down on him, but Ayram was looking to his witch.
“Why the boy?” he asked.
Elrahet grunted. “You would doubt my judgment, now of all times?”
“I need to know.”
Elrahet grunted again. She shuffled nearer. Mandri thought he could hear her old bones jangling inside her skin. She said, “A Minder’s connection to their Mazid is a leash. Hrkan Minders are trained from birth to shorten that leash to achieve some measure of control. This boy here lacks that training. Everyone here lacks that training. So it is no surprise that with him the leash is long. It will require time and effort on my part to focus him.”
From the way Ayram scrunched his brow, this explanation was just on the verge of being acceptable. “If the boy has no control, then why hasn’t the Mazid burnt us all with its fire?”
“As I’ve said before,” said Elrahet, voice weary and annoyed, “Mazidfire dwells in the Mazid, but it belongs to the Minder and only a strong Minder can wield it. As the boy is not yet strong, the Mazidfire is no danger. But commanding the Mazid to kneel, that he should be able to do.”
“Why can’t he?”
“It may be as the Mazid says—his will is weak. But sure as mudgrass grows in mud, his will shall return to him.”
Ayram gritted his teeth as he chewed on the witch’s words. This did not seem to be an acceptable answer. When he turned his attention to Obo, he said aloud, “Someone toss me a dagger.”
A bone-handled dagger came flying into the center of the circle and buried itself in the sand near Ayram’s feet. Ayram picked it up, and the blade was no bigger than a butterknife when compared to Ayram’s hand. The giant set the blade’s edge up tight against the side of Obo’s neck.
“Kneel,” he said brusquely.
Obo was unmoved. “Threats of violence can no more compel me to action than a word from my new Minder.”
Ayram rotated the dagger so that its sharp point was digging into Obo’s white skin. “If you don’t do what I want, then I have no use for you.”
“Then I suggest you direct your attention towards your choice of Minder.”
Ayram pushed the dagger’s tip into Obo’s flesh, more in curiosity than cruelty. It was a scene reminiscent of some sword-swallower’s trick—the blade was inches deep in Obo’s neck, and while Obo’s whole body was tense his face was completely unconcerned. And when Ayram withdrew the blade, only a few drops of blood trickled out from the wound.
Elrahet stepped forth once again and cleared her throat. “This is unneeded. The boy will control the creature in time. If he is unable, I will find someone who will.” 
“We don’t have time for that!” Ayram exclaimed as he shrugged her away and began to pace back and forth. His left hand clasped his right behind his back, while his right hand twirled the bone-handled blade like a toothpick in between dexterous fingers. It was a grand show of furious thinking, one which went on for far too long, though everyone was keen to indulge it. Eventually, he stopped right before Mandri’s downcast face—Ayram’s leather boots were the same width as Mandri’s own head.
“You are free to speak,” said Ayram.
Mandri lay silent for a respectful moment, then looked up and asked, “What do you want me to say?”
Ayram squatted down so that his great head blocked out the sun. “Were you always soft, or did dying do that to you? It couldn’t have been a bad death as you’re all in once piece.”
Mandri didn’t answer, so Ayram asked, “You ever killed anyone before?”
Mandri shook his head no.
“You ever killed a goat? A pig? Anything bigger than a rat?”
“I was a painter.”
Ayram sighed and stood back up. He said, “Of course you were. Did my people explain to you what this is all about?”
“No.”
Ayram rolled his eyes and chastised his people with disappointed glare. He said to Mandri, “I need you to use that Mazid’s fire to kill a demon. You know what a demon is, don’t you?”
Mandri nodded.
“I don’t speak of some storytime, feather-plucking demon. It is the demon of demons—a beast called the Amalgamete. If you are unwilling or unable to kill it, then I have no use for you. Is that clear?”
The bone-handled blade dripped a drop of blood onto Mandri’s robe.
“I may interject,” said Obo. “I have a potential solution to this little quandary we all find ourselves in.” 
“Do you?” Ayram asked, feigning interest.
“It seems that I have something you want, and you happen to have something that I want.”
“What I want you can’t give.”
“You want my fire to destroy some imagined enemy, and yes, given present circumstances, I cannot control my fire, but if circumstances were to change…”
“Get to the point.”
“How about a bargain?”
A few chuckles rose from the Ayramun, and Mandri thought he knew why—Ayram was big enough to simply take what he wanted. Like Tob had said, everything here was his. Ayram stared the Mazid square and said quite bluntly, “I don’t bargain with Hrks.”
“Then don’t call it bargaining,” Obo replied. “We’ll share gestures of goodwill. We can start small, if you like. I would gladly kneel before you if you would only show me some kindness in return. I don’t ask for much, as kneeling is no great demand. Give me a mouthful of water and I will kneel. I will grovel, if you like.”
“How is this going to get me Mazidfire?”
“I guarantee you, I will kill whatever you want if you give me what I want.”
“That so?”
“It is.”
Ayram thought for a moment, then he snapped his fingers at one of the nearby Ayramun and demanded their waterskin. The skin was tossed, Ayram snatched it out of the air, and he unplugged the cork and took a drink. His beard bulged as he swished the water around his mouth, and after he swallowed and smacked his lips he wondered aloud, “I didn’t know the Mazidai needed water.”
“We don’t,” Obo answered. “Again, this is about demonstrating a principle. I am not asking for water so much as asking for a sign of goodwill.”
“You first,” said Ayram. “Give us a gesture of goodwill, to demonstrate the principle.”
Obo promptly dropped to one knee and bowed his head. And there was no mockery in it—this bend of body and limb was honest, pure obeisance.
“Beautiful,” Ayram mused as he took a moment to appreciate the gesture. “But it goes against my nature to give water to a Hrk.”
He let the statement hang in the air, and when Obo raised his eyes in aggravation, Ayram tossed the waterskin. A chorus of mumbled grumbles sounded out as the waterskin, that sign of goodwill, flew through the air and landed against Obo’s genuflecting knee. Ayram silenced his people’s complaints with a glare, meanwhile Obo simply nodded his thanks and set the skin aside.
“So what will it be, then?” Ayram asked. “What will you take in exchange for hunting a beast?”
“I want my freedom.”
Ayram’s laugh was a bellowing slap—“Hah!”. And when the sound finished ringing around the pit, he said with magnanimous charm, “Kill the Amalgamete, and I’ll let you run into whatever hole you like.”
“No holes,” said Obo. “I wish to be rid of the pseudospark which dwells inside my stomach. I wish to be freed from the Minder’s will which beats my heart. If I had my own bright Spark, then my body and will would be my own. Give this to me, and I would use my fire to kill whoever, or whatever, you wish.”
Ayram’s brow jumped into an incredulous arc. “I’ve been mistaken for a god before, but never Solraheen Himself. You want me to forge a Divine Spark?”
Obo pointed to Mandri. “I was awake in the cave when your witch breathed a Spark into that boy’s body, so I know it is possible.”
All eyes swiveled to Mandri, who still lay sprawled in the center of the circle. He shrank within his robe against the onslaught of spiteful glares.
“If you could infuse Mandri’s corpse with a Spark, then do the same for me.”
Ayram turned to his scarecrow witch. “Tell the Mazid that it’s impossible.”
Elrahet had been standing perfectly still through all of this, staring at Mandri. Her eyes lingered a pinky finger longer on him, then they flicked away to scour Obo.
“I cleansed the boy’s Spark,” she said gruffly. “I did not breathe him a new one.”
“It can’t be done,” said Ayram firmly.
“I did not say it could not be done,” Elrahet growled as her hand twisted tight on the knobby head of her sand-smoothed cane. To Mandri’s great surprise, she even savored a sneer at her leader. “A Mazid is a kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving it a Spark would require a sacrifice greater than I can summon. Better to wring the will out of the boy. That, or we find another Minder.”
“Agreed,” said Ayram before turning to Obo and adding, “Even if she could do it, I cannot trust you.” Then he beckoned to his followers and barked, “Moto and Tob! Come hold it flat.”
Big bush Tob stood up. The other man, Moto, was an athletic Zosan. They both hurried over to the kneeling Obo. They grabbed him and laid him flat on the sand. Tob threw punches and elbows even though Obo did not resist. 
“Settle down Tob,” Ayram griped after Tob spat up a chunk of smoke-blacked spit onto Obo’s face. Tob grinned at Ayram’s chiding remark, though he did settle down as Ayram wandered back towards the cave and pulled from its shadows a giant blackened iron bar.
This bar was one solid piece of metal, taller than Ayram by a head. At its top, the iron splayed out into a chisel, while at the bottom, the iron belled out into a sphere the size of Ayram’s giant fist. Ayram gripped its octagonal haft and twirled the bar once as if it were as light as an oilwood spear.
“If I can’t make you kneel on my own terms,” he said to Obo, “Then you won’t need your legs.”
He marched towards Obo with menace in his step.
“There’s no need for this,” Obo protested, but Ayram was a man who could be moved. He said, “If the Minder can’t mind, then what’s there to stop you from running away when no one’s looking? No. We’ll all be more comfortable this way.”
He raised his spear above Obo’s thigh, and Mandri shut his eyes.
While Mandri could hide from the sight of such a gruesome affair, he could not hide from the sound. When the chisel-head stabbed into Obo’s flesh it snapped the bone.
But Obo did not cry out. Mandri, stunned, sneaked a peek, and there nearby was the Zosan, Moto, steadying Obo’s left hip as he hacked at the broken leg with his sword. Tob then pulled the leg away, dragging out a mess of blood and stringy tendons. They repeated this work on Obo’s other leg to the sound of cheering Ayramun.
Through it all, Obo made no sound, and when it was over, and he was legless, Ayram raised his iron bar and shouted, “Someone bag the Mazid up! Bag everything up. It’s time to walk. That damned Amalgamete ain’t coming to us.”
All the Ayramun jumped up and grabbed their things. They shuffled past Mandri and into the darkness of the cave. Forty stopped at Mandri’s side and helped him up. She told him to follow the others. As Mandri walked, he glanced back towards Obo, whose blood-stub of a body was a frightful sight laying there in the sand, and just as Mandri’s heart was strafed by the shame of somehow having caused all this, Obo caught his eye, smiled, and gave him another wink, before promptly shutting his eyes for another long spell of pretending to be unconscious.</Text>
