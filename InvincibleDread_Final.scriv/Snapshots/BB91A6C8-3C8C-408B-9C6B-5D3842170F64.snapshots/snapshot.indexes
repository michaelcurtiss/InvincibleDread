        <Title>Bigger changes</Title>
        <Text>Mandri did not have to look long for an unnatural hole which might lead down to Shis, as there was one in the cluttered study that lay adjacent to the throne room.
The king’s study.
Greskal’s study.
The man must have found some dark and ancient grimoire that lured him to seek succor in Shis. Or so Mandri supposed. Finding that book would be difficult, as it seemed every book in the room had its spine cut and its innards loosed, and all these sheets of paper were scattered about like moon moths. Some were stuck to the walls. Some alighted on the large upturned table that lay canted on the far side of the room, legs sticking up like a rigor mortised cow. Some paper fluttered on the rim of a shield-sized hole in the center of the floor. A green carpet hung down into that hole’s the depths, a carpet ripped to rags by a track of claw marks. Ascending claw marks, judging from the direction of the rip.
Moto dropped his torch down into this hole, revealing a red rock floor some few meters away.
“This should be fun,” said Obo. Mandri agreed. He felt invincible with Obo staring over his shoulder, though he was a tad worried that if a snarling demon dripped down out of the black, that Obo’s purging flame might singe his cheek.
Mandri paused to take a quick sip of his God’s Eye burgeon, for the God’s Eye sight had faded. Obo had preternatural senses, and he wanted them too, especially now that he’d be taking the lead. When he’d stowed that burgeon away nice and safe inside his robe, he jumped down into that hole and picked up Moto’s torch.
At first there was it was a single tunnel, and its walls were fixed in brick and reinforced with wooden beams, but these constructions  soon gave way to a meandering maze of natural stone which felt as old as the world itself. Mandri lead, torch in hand, and Moteah then Moto followed close behind. The air was alive the sounds of footfalls and heavy breathing, some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight—no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons waiting for a chance to strike. After some tracking and backtracking through this maze, Mandri turned a tight corner and came upon a doorless stone arch of ordinary size. This arch’s posts were perfectly plumb and square, and unfamiliar symbols were etched into them.
Mandri hesitated before it.
“Cold feet?” Moteah asked behind him. 
Mandri’s feet were cold, but that had nothing to do with it. He waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock and asked of anyone, “Can you read this?”
“It’s Schisol’s creed,” Obo said.
Every good Jandri child knows the words to Schisol’s creed. It is a creed which has floated through the Old Jandri world since forever. Solitants address it in mocking tones to rob the words of their power. In Hrkan law, whenever the creed is written in text, each line must be accompanied by a marginal note that explains the utter foolishness of it.

Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth.	(Premise assumes conclusion)
Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right. 	(Ambiguous terms.)
Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.	(Demonstrably wrong.)
Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be together.	(Pseudoprofundity)

That final, ominous line has spurred many a suicide pact, despite demystification. Such events are the work of demons, Solitants say. Demons put it in peoples heads that they’ll be less lonely in Shis they bring other people down with them. It explains murder-suicides too. It’s all the influence of demons. And here Mandri was, heading down to Shis, being followed.
“We should keep moving,” Moteah said as she nudged Obo’s litter.
Mandri could not take his sight from the threshold. The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of symbols. He dared to reach out and touch them, and he found the grooves to be free of dust. All of it was remarkably clean.
Obo’s reassuring voice popped into his ear. “Whatever’s down here, I’ll handle it.” He then gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder, and confidence returned to Mandri’s legs. He stepped through the gate.
What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone arch made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with a few thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs, and that was barely enough. This path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. Elrahet and the others were creeping along this treacherous brink, with only a few cutout handholds keeping them from certain death.
Once all the Ayramun had shimmied across, it was Mandri’s turn. He tried to move but his knees were locked in fear. His armpits were practically sweating rain despite the chill that blew up from the fissure.
Mandri looked at the ledge as it flickered in the torchlight. It was barely there.
“Come on,” said Moto from the other side.
Mandri tossed his torch across—he wasn’t about to try this with only one hand. Then he prayed a wordless prayer, stepped up to the abyss, and began to side-shuffle along the ledge. He was halfway across when a sliver of stone broke out from under his leading foot. He swayed out into the darkness, but he was able to pull himself against the rock wall and regained his balance, but he didn’t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the abyss, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up and nearly knocking Mandri loose. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him.
They journeyed on and the rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. The walls were so narrow in places that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways, dragging his Obo laden pack behind like a stubborn dog. Elrahet marched through it all with purpose in her step. She spared no hesitation whenever a decision needed to be made about which dark and foreboding path to take. Mandri had expected this adventure under the earth would resemble their stumbling through the temple Shulgi—butting into dead ends and unremembered rooms, but that never happened. Elrahet had been here before.
She led them into a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill, and this left Mandri’s hands cold and clammy, and he started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself, for his torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable—hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows which he mistook for mere divots gave way to potholes to twist his ankle. And the longer it went on the less and less he cared about even these scrapes and bruises. He wondered if this malaise was a result of nearing to the core of Shis.
He measured out time by measuring the weariness in his legs. The start of soreness in his calves was a sign that it’d been at least four hands. Once the unremitting burn set into his thighs, well that marked at least a half-days journey. It was an accurate system, or so Mandri believed, because every time he reached the edge of giving up Elrahet stopped underneath a hang of rock and they rested, huddled around a small fire of twigs, though they rested only as long as it took for the fire to turn the twigs to ash. After the second rest like this, Mandri’s system of measurement was broke, because when they started out again his legs were already sore. 
 It wasn’t until the fourth march that Mandri’s shoes slapped onto paved floor. This came as a great surprise because the walls were still rough hewn, and his feet were so used to stubbing their toes against unsettling bumps, that finding themselves on a surface as flat as screeded sand challenged their whole sense of reality. It was grey clay tiling, and engraved along the border of each square tile was a jagged chain of thorns. This hall spilled out into a larger one, and this larger hall opened up into a cavern that was so large that its size was impossible to say. The entirety of this cavern floor was paved in those tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps the pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. It was unfamiliar design, like a flower with it’s petals closed, and though Mandri had never seen its like before he knew it was a sign of Schisol. 
The sound of their shuffling feet reverberated out into the emptiness, and they all hunched along as if sneaking. Mandri almost laughed at the sight of his skulking band, because if any nearby demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they’d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches. And they moved like this for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern’s end. They could go no further, for the grey stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a giant stone double-door that would take a team of oxen to open. These imposing doors were to sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures from which Batata had drawn inspiration. But these demons looked much more real when rendered in stone, and instead of whipping stick-figured humans, they were doing unmentionable things to men and women fully fleshed.
Set atop these doors was a stone head in flat relief, bald like Obo’s, and twice as unnerving because it seemed to be licking its lips at sight of Mandri’s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders, and the rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly arms stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door’s bottom hinges.
“Spark a fire,” said Elrahet as she eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn.
Moto unstrapped his pack and pulled out a handful broken twigs.
“More,” said Elrahet. “All of it. We might be waiting here a while.”
Mandri was thankful for the pause, though he wished Elrahet had picked a less conspicuous location. It seemed imprudent to make camp on the very doorstep of Shis, and judging from the nervous looks the others shared, he was not the only one to feel that way.



A sign or confirmation, when suddenly, out of the darkness around him there arose a voice, a woman’s voice, a voice as old and rumbling as Elrahet’s.
“Welllllcome”, it said in a gnarled, as if it were inviting him to join the dead.
Mandri spun his back to fire and faced the cavernous void. He saw nothing and no one. Then came a grinding sound as stone slid against stone. The great doors of Shis were swiveling in their hinges. They swiveled inward, and they opened up a wide enough slit for a single figure to pass through—an old woman tall and graceful, robed in a single black sheet that draped down to the floor but did not touch, and as the woman moved towards the fire she seemed to float. Mandri recognized her instantly—it was Pell.
It was the demon-witch who’d killed is ox.
It was the dark priestess who’d set this  all into motion.
Both Moto and Moteah sprang up and drew their swords.
“Stay your hand!” Elrahet shouted. “She’s who we’ve come to see.” 
“Have you come to see me,” said Pell she drifted nearer, her long black robe reflecting a velvet sheen. “Or have you come to tell these people lies?”
“I told no lies,” Elrahet growled as she stood up with the help of her cane.
“Oh please,” said Pell, “You’re old enough to know that when you leave out important details, that’s as good as lying.”
Pell came to a halt a few yards away from the fire, careful not to enter the Ayramun’s circle. Moto and Moteah had yet to sheathe their swords.
“You know I could kill you all with a blink,” she said.
Moto’s hand tightened against the leather grip of his sword. Mandri knew swords were no use here, and that Moto, fast as he was, could not outswing the speed of that deceptive witch.
“She’s posturing,” Elrahet said as she made her way around the fire to confront her counterpart. She stood before the much taller witch and stamped her cane defiantly against the floor. “She and we have a truce.”
“We do,” said Pell. “Though I must admit, there’s always that lingering thought, isn’t there, that if I were to kill you one more time, it could be the death that sticks.”
Elrahet’s retort was grumble, to which Pell smiled and said, “If you’ve come to my door to offer yourselves to the slaughter, then I accept.”
“I said we’ve come to see you, and that’s all we’ve come to do. Seeing you is enough.”
Amusement flickered across Pell’s aged face.
“See me? That’s all? I know I’m beautiful, but to make such a journey to merely see me—it’s too flattering.”
“Some among us needed to see your evil for themselves.”
“Oh, I see.”
Pell’s imperious gaze turned to the others gathered around the fire, and especially Obo. She leered at him as a Lord leers at a broken man. 
 She said, “You’ve come to show off your new toy, is that it?”
“The Mazyd is no toy,” said Elrahet. “It’s as Sparked as you and me.”
The news shattered Pell’s smirk into a wrinkling frown. She spat at Obo, then regarded Elrahet anew with fury. “There’s no end to your perversions of the Spark, is there!? Still building abominations.”
“Abomination?” Elrahet snarled. “Speak of abomination, bitch—what of the poles in the Goree Pass?”
The mention of those accursed poles set Pell back at ease. She drew her lips tight and said, “You can hardly blame the demons. They’ve only been waiting five thousand years for these blessed days. That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? You can feel it coming, can’t you? Despite all your travails in the Sand, you worry—it’s all been for nothing.”
“You do not see everything,” said Elrahet.
“Neither do you.”
“I see more than you.”
“Oh please, how could that possibly be true when your eyes have never grown accustomed to the dark?”
“We’ve killed your Amalgamete,” said Elrahet.
Pell deflected this triumph away with a wave of her hand. “I wasn’t referring to Greskal.”
Elrahet’s grin curdled into a scowl and Pell reveled in it. She then turned her attention to the Ayramun, savored their unease, and when her eyes finally alighted on Mandri she locked her gaze with his, and for a shuttered instant her true eyes flashed, bright and warm, golden threaded, declaring mystic tidings which Mandri could not being to comprehend—then she blinked and her eyes were dark again, she looked away, leaving Mandri to wonder if the others had caught it too.
“Gentle Sparks,” Pell said aloud, throwing her voice out into the cavern, “Would you please grace us with your presence?”
Her request fell into the black, and a moment later the black began stir. Mandri tried to rub the insanity out of his eyes, but yes, the black itself began to stir, and as it weaved and wound it squelched out growls and grated shrieks, then bright points of light emerged within it like jittering stars, and these stars mounded up, grew brighter, and as they did along came the the pitching laughter of demons—not just two, or three, or twenty, for that horde of stars resolved themselves into a horde of fire reflecting eyes—thousands of blinking eyes in a thousand different configurations—eyes set wide, bovine eyes, mousey eyes, eyes of giants, eight-fold sets of spider eyes swaying overhead, all of them hesitant to enter into the firelight, as if embarrassed of their own grotesquery. 
The first demon Mandri actually saw came ambling in and out of the dimness in a naked knuckle-walking strut. It was vaguely human, with a mouthless face that was scrunched towards the middle, as if its skin was being pulled into its nose. After this frightening sight, another set of glowing eyes stepped forth with confidence into the light, revealing a goat headed demon with black Zosan skin and a chiseled physique, and its feet were hooved as well. This demon was then joined by a circle of its horrid brethren, each leaping out, it seemed, from Mandri’s childhood dreams for there was every manner of mashed-up anatomy between man, insect, and beast. This circle of dread surrounded the Ayramun, a circle broken only by Pell and the doors of Shis behind her.
“You see,” Pell said to Elrahet, “You’ve spent so much time staring at Solraheen that His light has blinded you to what the world is becoming. Now, if you would, please leave, before I begin to forget the practical nature of our truce.”
Elrahet was stuck in shock at the sight of so great an evil—rank upon rank of evil. Her face was so that it seemed she’d just witnessed the very end of days. It was Purl who shook her out of this by saying her name, “Elrahet!”
The old witch snapped to and, 
“We leave!”
Everyone snatched up their packs and lit their torches in the campfire’s flame.
Obo did not move.
“Hold on,” he said to all. He stilted his way towards Pell so that she could see him clearly. He asked her, “These demons here, they want to kill me?”
“Nothing so crude,” said Pell. “They want to recover your Spark and add it to their own.”
One of the demons nearest Obo, a tusked woman with the body of a boar snarled and hissed, spraying Obo with its putrid spittle.
Pell said, “She wishes to put you back where you belong.”
Obo wiped his cheek and replied, “That is not acceptable.”
His blunt response jolted Pell into amazement. Her thin lips grew tight, her brows jumped, and then she burst into a tremendous fit of laughter which was taken up by her demon horde and escalated into terrifying noise that rivaled a peal of thunder.
“Oh, my, my!” she said. “Not acceptable?! My dear Mazyd, we have collected an uncountable number of Sparks throughout the ages—yours will be no different.”
“Of that uncountable number,” said Obo, “How many belonged to Mazyd?”
Pell stooped down to peer at Obo, hands on knees, as if she were lecturing a child.
“We have collected the Sparks of gods. I assure you, yours will be no different.”
“Then it seems a peaceable conclusion is not possible.”
“It never is.”
“Very well.”
Obo, , opened his mouth. A heartbeat later and his throat ran gold and fire poured out in a beam as bright as the sun, smashing through the air where Pell had been for she’d expected this turn, and disappeared into a flash of smoke before the heat could singe her. Obo’s blazing fire to smashed through this swirling cloud and it burned through the left door of Shis—such was its power that pushed through the stone as easily it would push through a slab of skin. Such was the dazzling brilliance of this roaring flame that it surprised even Obo.
“IDIOT!” Elrahet screamed as she swung her cane at Obo’s head. It smacked the Mazyd’s skull hard, but it was the cane that cracked.
“I didn’t know she could do that,” said Obo as he watched the smoke that was once a witch dissipate into nothingness. Mandri hoped for a moment that old witch might have, somehow, been vaporized by Obo’s power, but then her laugh echoed austere throughout the cavern.
“You’ve broken truce,” she said.
“Not me!” Elrahet replied.
But Pell was unforgiving. “You know the rules.”
The sea of demons began to chatter—teeth chatter, giggle chatter, yapping, sucking, squealing chatter—but they were all too timid to pounce. Then the black, goatheaded demon took a step forward, and this seemed to steel their spines.
Moteah, eyes wide in terror at a fish-headed bear giant looming tall above her, screamed, “You’ve doomed us!”
“Relax,” said Obo, “Someone give me a boost.”
Mandri ran to Obo, grabbed the Mazyd’s arm swung him up and onto the shoulder, where Obo, in this heightened state, tried to plead with the horde. “My dear fellows, if you wish to survive, then you will—”
His plea was cut short by the hunting shriek of a bat swooping overhead. This winged beast was the size of a child, with a child’s flat face and enormous funnel ears wrapping round its head to fan-frame its pea-sized eyes. It dropped out of the cavernous night like an arrow, its curved claws splayed and grasped, its round face contorted in anger—or maybe it was agony, for almost as soon as Mandri saw the creature its head was smashed by a roaring burst of mazydfire, a flame so hot it heated the whole head into incandescence and then it popped. The rest of the body burst into flames and hurtled overhead to crash into the crowd of demons behind. 
With the first blow struck, the army of Shis broke loose.
The demons came running, hopping, sliding, striding, galloping towards Mandri and the Ayramun. Their muscles bulged and their scales sparkled, their whiskered snouts and fanged maws hissed, their pointed beaks screamed for oblivion—but Obo’s golden mazydfire screamed back, it lashed out in two great sweeping arcs to cut down a circle around the Ayramun, obliterating the first rank of demons, cutting the confidence out of that goat-headed demon at the waist. Those that scurried underneath Obo’s sweeping flame—the dog, hog, and lizard demons, the beetle demons—these Obo dispatched with incredible precision and blinding speed as more than twenty blaring beams of flame blasted out of his mouth in space of a breath, vaporizing the head of each demented creature on contact, and when the mazydfire was gone their bodies burst whole into flame leaving a ring of sizzling, steaming flesh to serve as stumbling blocks to the rest of the onrushing horde. 
The Ayramun gathered close to Mandri, close to Obo, and they found safety there underneath his sweeping flame. Obo set himself proud on Mandri’s shoulder, and once all were near, his golden fury raged out again, this time spiraling round and round, cutting down hundreds, perhaps thousands, for at each rotation his mazydfire traveled further out, mowing down larger and larger swathes of demons, and as Obo’s golden beam swept through the dark it left in its wake a smattering of little explosions as all who fell combusted. All demons, no matter how large and fierce, fled before the slaughter. It was truly an awesome display of power, and it was sitting atop Mandri’s shoulder, and so great was Mandri’s awe that he could not contain himself and he whooped his excitement. Obo—pitiful Obo—had turned away the army of Shis all by himself.

Blasts them out of the sky, beam beam beam
The entire horde was dead.
Head turned towards the door. Low hum, ravaneous horde. Glint of firelight on their backs like a swarm of hornets.
“Um…I don’t have enough in me for all of them.”
Ayramun what that meant.
Elrahet screamed, “Run!”
Mandri slowest.
As he running. Heart exploding in his chest.
“Mandri.”
“What!?”
“Remember what you said about friendship?”
“Obo, what in the white light—”
“I’m going to prove something to you.”
Hops off.
Mandri running away.
Moto, moteah, and Purl cut them with swords. 
Demons ran right past them.
All to Obo.
it clicked. The conversation. He’d said no one. He wasn’t about to let Obo prove him wrong. Grab Obo and not let him do it.
Demons swarm. 
#
Obo was to slow. Beam weaker. Burning himself alive.
Slice.
Cut. 
#
No!
#
As if the sl. Time was slipping, Mandri had the. Frozen. As before, in the Goree Pass. The rainbowed light of purpose.
An urge, again to paint. A glorious scene. Figures in such as only artists could dream, a diorama of flesh, flame, and butchery. Threading through his eye.
He was crying, eyes wide, tears overflowing his lid. Not for his mother. Not for himself. He cried for Obo.
#
#
She pushes, tries to move. Hard as a statue.
“Incredible.”
She sways and moves and effortlessly glides. Admires Mandri.
#
“I didn’t think it’d happen so soon. I’ve been waiting for a thousand years, and here you are.”
Mandri did not dare to speak but his muscles the scene and if he were to speak the tension break.
“Tongue tied? Do I frighten you? I’m the mother of demons—who wouldn’t be scared of me?”
“Speak, Mandrameen. This is your moment.” 
“What is happening?”
“I can’t tell you. You can only be shown. You have to show yourself.”
#
She pulls out a the black stone canvas and paints.
#
“You want me to paint?”
#
“That is what you were made for. That is why you are here. Why else would you have come to very doorstep of Shis? You will paint a self-portrait—the first true self-portrait you’ve ever painting..”
#
“But what is happening?”
#
“You have to move beyond that Mandri. Your mind is rooted in causes and effects, but none of these are real. You believe that you are Mandrameen, but that, too, is an illusion. Mandri was born, he will die, while your real being knows neither beginning, nor end.”
Mandri flick to Obo.
“I can see I’m not making myself clear. Speech is too blunt a tool. If you begin to paint, I’m sure, you’ll come to understand.”
“No.”
“No?”
“I’m not going to do that.”
Remembering what happened last time.
Disappointment.
#
“Mandri, you are going to do it. Why else would you be here?”
Upset confusion into a Beatific smile.
“Remember Mandrameen the portrait painter? He knew what everyone looked like, except for himself. Isn’t that right? A true self-portrait is impossible because you don’t truly know your own face, even if you have a mirror—you can turn your head in every direction, but your eyes are always looking straight into themselves. You can look around and study your features, but you’ll never capture that look of looking away. That’s how the mirror nurtures the illusion of the self—you’re always looking straight into your own eyes and you begin to think that that is you. But you’ve never seen what you look like when you’re sleeping. You’ll never see what you look like when you’re dead. Everyone else’s eyes will shutter, but you’re own—you’ve never seen it happen, so who’s to say they’ll ever close? Do you blink, Mandri? Do you notice yourself blinking? Don’t blink now, or you might ruin it.
#
Mandri realized he hadn’t yet blinked since. His eyes were stuck in the trance.
#
“Do you sleep? What happens to Mandrameen when you sleep? Where does he go?”
“I’ve never thought about it.”
Sigh. 
“At least you’re honest. That’s more than I can say for most people.” 
Wistful look at Elrahet, Moto.
“Look at them. They can’t see any of this. Look at how frightened they are of dying. You see, all they’ll lose is the stories they create of themselves. They invent themselves just to torment themselves.”
Look to Obo.
“The Mazid too. What an ironic creature—spent its short life searching for freedom and finds it, but in so doing he’s become an enslaver of the Spark.”
“How do you know that?”
“I’ll talk about him as I wish. You know it because Schisol told you?”
“I do.”
Mandri throws the rock.
“Ack!”
Stare at Mandri. Burst into an absolute fit of laughter.
“Do you think you just proved me wrong!? You do, don’t you?”
“You’re so full of shit.
“Oh, my dear Mandri. How can you not see you’re the gaburshegee, the infertile ground, you deny everyone else’s plans for you, even mine. No one in the world can tell you what to do. But there’s one more person you have to reject.”
“Schisol?”
“Yourself. You see through everyone else’s manipulations, you need only to take it one step further.”
“And what if I don’t want to?”
“What you want is irrelevant.”
“Are you going to force me to paint a picture?”
“I cannot. You must pick up the brush on your own accord. When you’re ready. As you can see, we have all the time in the world.”
He’d heard enough. Sees Obo’s spark interest.
“Your Spark seeks another. This is what it wants.”
“You can be in union with it. This pain you feel, it is not necessary.”
Sees Obo. Tearjerk. Injustice. Wasteful. Meaning.
“I thought it was only Solraheen who’d make a sacrifice like this.”
“Solraheen a sacrifice!? You don’t actually believe that story, do you? You’re smarter than that, Mandri.”
Confusion.
“It was Schisol who called down the Fabled Black, not Solraheen. Schisol knew what would happen if the people were left to govern their own affairs. Given enough time, their selfishness, loneliness, and desperation would only strengthen in the absence of a god. Schisol trapped Himself to keep Solraheen from interfering with my work. And soon, when I am finished, and have united all the Spark, it is Schisol who will make the ultimate sacrifice—for dying is no great sacrifice, no, Schisol will live, He’ll live for all eternity alone, weeping, just to protect against the chance of His brother rising up and starting it all over again.”
#
“Where are you going?”
“To test a theory.”
Brings the Spark along, dragging the light of purpose along with him. Steps to the edge of the abyss.
“What are you doing?” Pell asked, her voice on as much of an edge as Mandri’s toes.
Mandri answered her by dropping Obo’s Spark. It fell into the Abyss, shining bright like a distant star, until finally, it disappeared all together, dragging a of million threads down with it.
He blinked.
Time restarted and the . As cleared, there was Pell, fuming. She shrieked a , “You’ll be back!” she shrieked. “It is FATED!”. Her final word echoed through the cavernous void, and then she split into smoke. 
Mandri turned, and there was the Ayramun, 
“What happened?” Purl asked.
“Let’s go,” he replied. Brushed passed Moto who shouted, “Boy!”
Mandri turned and said defiantly, “My name is Mandri.”
Moto , sorry about it, before asking calmly, “What happened?” 
“Obo sacrificed himself for you.”
“The Mazid?”
“His name was Obo.”
Kept on walking.
“Mandri!” Elrahet. “Can you see the threads of purpose?”
“Yes. Not right now. But I could. Can you?”
Nod.
“You can see them right now?”
“I can.”
“And where do they lead?”
#
#
Let me make clear. From now on, I am no longer Elrahet. I am Elrah. You are now the Elrahun. Leave me on pain of death. Betray me on pain of a tortured life. 
Sneer at them all.
Do you submit?
Purl kneeled. Moteah did as well. Moto, s to a woman but at a glare from his sister, he kneeled. 
Mandri . He would kneel for no one. He’d turned one old witch down.
Seeing Mandri still standing, Moto, and he stood back up. Ashamed and embarrassed that he’d ever 
Moteah pulled him back down.
Elrah said to Mandri, You will the Sand on your own, and you will die.
Your aid didn’t seem to help the rest of the Ayramun.
Insult.
#
The rest of the Elrahun followed.
#
Mandri has God’s Eye in his robe.
#
//“Where are you going?” asked Moteah.
He paused and said, “I’m going to free Solraheen.”
Mandri, though he did not know the way. 
//

Looking into Obo’s open chest, there was purl’s hand.

Tobs rocks - light of purpose - wondering what to do - picks one up - thread of purpose whistled up and arc to Pell’s forehead. He threw it. Expected it to kill her. Plunked on the floor
“Ack!”

        <Title>Purpose change</Title>
        <Text>Mandri did not have to look long for an unnatural hole which might lead down to Shis, as there was one in the cluttered study that lay adjacent to the throne room.
The king’s study.
Greskal’s study.
The man must have found some dark and ancient grimoire that lured him to seek succor in Shis. Or so Mandri supposed. Finding that book would be difficult, as it seemed every book in the room had its spine cut and its innards loosed, and all these sheets of paper were scattered about like moon moths. Some were stuck to the walls. Some alighted on the large upturned table that lay canted on the far side of the room, legs sticking up like a rigor mortised cow. Some paper fluttered on the rim of a shield-sized hole in the center of the floor. A green carpet hung down into that hole’s the depths, a carpet ripped to rags by a track of claw marks. Ascending claw marks, judging from the direction of the rip.
Moto dropped his torch down into this hole, revealing a red rock floor some few meters away.
“This should be fun,” said Obo. Mandri agreed. He felt invincible with Obo staring over his shoulder, though he was a tad worried that if a snarling demon dripped down out of the black, that Obo’s purging flame might singe his cheek.
Mandri paused to take a quick sip of his God’s Eye burgeon, for the God’s Eye sight had faded. Obo had preternatural senses, and he wanted them too, especially now that he’d be taking the lead. When he’d stowed that burgeon away nice and safe inside his robe, he jumped down into that hole and picked up Moto’s torch.
At first there was it was a single tunnel, and its walls were fixed in brick and reinforced with wooden beams, but these constructions soon gave way to a meandering maze of natural stone which felt as old as the world itself. Mandri lead, torch in hand, and Moteah then Moto followed close behind. The air was alive the sounds of footfalls and heavy breathing, some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight—no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons waiting for a chance to strike. After some tracking and backtracking through this maze, Mandri turned a tight corner and came upon a doorless stone arch of ordinary size. This arch’s posts were perfectly plumb and square, and unfamiliar symbols were etched into them.
Mandri hesitated before it.
“Cold feet?” Moteah asked behind him. 
Mandri’s feet were cold, but that had nothing to do with it. He waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock and asked of anyone, “Can you read this?”
“It’s Schisol’s creed,” Obo said.
Every good Jandri child knows the words to Schisol’s creed. It is a creed which has floated through the Old Jandri world since forever. Solitants address it in mocking tones to rob the words of their power. In Hrkan law, whenever the creed is written in text, each line must be accompanied by a marginal note that explains the utter foolishness of it.

Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth.	(Premise assumes conclusion)
Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right. 	(Ambiguous terms.)
Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.	(Demonstrably wrong.)
Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be together.	(Pseudoprofundity)

That final, ominous line has spurred many a suicide pact, despite demystification. Such events are the work of demons, Solitants say. Demons put it in peoples heads that they’ll be less lonely in Shis they bring other people down with them. It explains murder-suicides too. It’s all the influence of demons. And here Mandri was, heading down to Shis, being followed.
“We should keep moving,” Moteah said as she nudged Obo’s litter.
Mandri could not take his sight from the threshold. The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of symbols. He dared to reach out and touch them, and he found the grooves to be free of dust. All of it was remarkably clean.
Obo’s reassuring voice popped into his ear. “Whatever’s down here, I’ll handle it.” He then gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder, and confidence returned to Mandri’s legs. He stepped through the gate.
What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone arch made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with a few thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs, and that was barely enough. This path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. As Mandri had only one hand, he gave his torch to Obo to hold. And again his confidence fled from him—Obo might be able to save him from demons, but he couldn’t chase away a deep abyss. 
When he’d shimmied halfway across, he slipped on loose shard of rock that went tumbling into the void. He was able to regain his balance fairly easily, but he didn’t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the abyss, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up from below. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him. Neither Moto nor Moteah said anything, and so they journeyed on.
The rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. In places, the walls were so narrow that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways. Obo swiveled behind like a stubborn dog. Next came a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill, and this left Mandri’s hand cold and clammy. He started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself. The torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable—hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows that looked like shallow divots gave way to potholes that twisted his ankle. But the longer it went on the less and less he cared about these scrapes and bruises, because the ways were much more up-and-down than anything in the desert, or even the Goree Pass, and an unremitting burn set into his thighs.
They rested for a while underneath a hang of rock. Moto set up a house of twigs, set them alight, and when these twigs burned to ash they moved on again. They walked for another long while, became sore again, rested again, and at this point no one could agree on whether it was night or day above.
The God’s Eye sight came to Mandri on the third march. First came that familiar flash of white. His vision was flooded with a cosmic swirl of shimmering brightness, and when he Mandri shucked his mind free of this blinding vision, he could see everyone’s Sparks stirring in their stomachs. Obo’s gold Spark outshone them all, but bright as he was, bright as they all were, they illuminated nothing. The dark dominion was oppressive, nothing like the Sand above, where even the rocks were coated with fibrous purpose. Down here the rocks were dead, and the only threads of purpose he could see were those which connected their Sparks, as well as those few threads which stretched out of their Sparks and into tunnel ahead, drawing out the paths which they would walk.
Mandri followed his own thread of purpose and traced its movement with his stomach-dwelling Spark.
It was strange, seeing the future.
Following it was even stranger—did he follow it because he could see it and wanted to know where it went? Or did he follow it because it drew him along like some sort of puppet. The others were puppeted along, no doubt, as they couldn’t see what he saw. They couldn’t see the threads, and so they couldn’t see the choice, much less make one.
Then they came to a fork in the tunnel. All threads of purpose chose to wander right. Moto and Moteah argued about which way to go. Mandri stayed silent. Obo claimed he could hear faint echoes coming from the right, and so they chose to head right.
But Mandri knew that their turning right was not a choice. The noise that Obo heard had a cause, and that cause was also caused, and so causes carry on in an infinite regress which could only end in the hand of Solraheen weaving a desired future. Mandri truly believed that this thread he followed was put there by Solraheen, and it was this great faith that compelled him to see it through.
Soon, the way spilled out into a short, brickworked hall, and his shoes slapped onto flat stone tile. This hall then opened up into a cavern whose size was difficult to estimate. It was large enough to hide the echoes of their shuffling feet, so it must have been larger than Shulgi’s throne room. And the entirety of this cavern floor was paved in tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps or so, the floor’s simple square pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. 
This black sun was unfamiliar design, like a flower with its petals closed and all points pointing inwards. In some sense, it was the opposite of the eightfold Jandri sun. Mandri took it to be a sign of Schisol, and he did not stop to study any of them. He hunched along as if sneaking. He almost laughed at the sight of Moto and and Moteah skulking along behind, because if any demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they’d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches.
But there were no demons. In all the blackness around them, there were no demons or demon Sparks. And there weren’t any threads of purpose spelling out their doom. There was only that faint swirl of guiding purpose floating in front of them and disappearing into the dark. 
They walked through this cavern for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern’s end. The purpose ended here—they could go no further. The stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a monstrous stone double-door that would require a team of oxen to open. These doors seemed sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures mostly, snarling demons doing unmentionable things to men and women unfleshed.
Set atop these doors was a stone head, bald like Obo’s, and twice as unnerving because it seemed to be licking its lips at sight of Mandri’s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders. The rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly limbs stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door’s bottom hinges.
Moteah eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn. “What do we do now?”
Mandri was dismayed to see his thread of purpose knot up at base of the door. “I don’t know,” he said. “I think I just stand here and…”
“Knock?” said Moto.
Mandri reached out to knock, but there wasn’t a clean spot for it. The door’s panel was too full of sculpted, snarling demons. In the end he made no decision, as a thread of purpose alighted out of nothing to guide his knuckles toward the forehead of an anguished man who was being yanked along by hooks set into his skin.
The sound of Mandri’s knock was soft and barely there, two quick raps.
He took a step back, and waited.
He did not wait long, for out of the air around him there arose a voice, a woman’s voice, a voice as old and aggrieved as Elrahet’s.
“Come in”, it said, and it was followed by the sound of sound of stone grinding against stone as the great doors of Shis swiveled in their hinges. They swiveled inward, and the doors two halves split to reveal a split of black. Tucked inside this darkness was a golden Spark.
The Spark floated forth and the torchlight revealed its figure—an old woman, tall and graceful, robed in a single black satin sheet that draped down to the floor but did not touch. Mandri recognized her long nose and imperious glare instantly—it was Pell.
It was the demon-witch who’d killed is ox. The witch who’d set this all into motion, if causes could begin with her. Foul causes surely did. Not Solraheen’s hand, but Schisol’s.
Moto and Moteah drew their swords.
Pell drew a thin lipped smile.
“Oh, please,” she said to them, “Where are your manners?”

“Put your swords away,”
They do. 
“Thank you.”
She sways and moves and effortless glide.
“And thank you.” she said as she cast an adoring eye upon Mandri. “You don’t know how long I’ve been trying to end Elrahet, and you’ve managed it accidentally.”
Mandri did not dare to speak but his muscles the scene and if he were to speak the tension break.
“Tongue tied? Do I frighten you? Speak, Mandrameen. This is your moment.” 
Moto was the one to seize it. “Mazid, Kill her!”
Obo climbed out of his litter and he sat on Mandri’s shoulder like an overgrown cat. He rested his elbow on Mandri’s head and said to Pell, “I’ve heard stories about you.”
“This ironic . A creature spends its short life searching for freedom, and it only had to enslave a Spark to find it.”
“As may be,” said Obo. “But they say that you are my enemy, that you are a great evil, and that I should kill you.”
Pell stood there silent. She was either unwilling or unable to answer the question. Whichever it was, was hidden behind her stony glare.
Obo said, “Have you nothing to say in your defense?”
Pell curled her lip. “Nothing I say will change what you will do. You will all do what you will do.”
“That is a…curious turn of phrase. But, help me understand, was it you who corrupted the old king Greskal and brought forth the Amalgamete?”
“None but the Amalgamete can bring forth the Amalgamete.”
Moto was sweating rain despite the cavern’s chill. He shouted, “Why are you talking to her? Kill her!”
Pell rolled her eyes at the outburst. “Don’t fret, child, I am not the one who condemned you. That was Solraheen, your benevolent, loving, murderous god.”
“She’s Schisol’s shadow—kill her!”
“I am Schisol’s shadow, yes, and proud of it! Know that Solraheen is false and he does not love you. Know that Solraheen never called down that rock of Fabled Black to kill Himself and save the world. Know that this was done by Schisol, know that He sacrificed himself for your sakes, that Solraheen could no longer torture your Sparks.”
“Do you have any proof of your claims?” Obo asked. “Or do witchy women only truck with stories?”
“The proof is the peace that is soon to come. A peace which you will find it in the belly of the Amalgamete.”
“I’ve killed your Amalgamete.”
Pell deflected this triumph away with a twitch of her sharp chin. “Another will come. In fact, he stands now on my doorstep.”
Her eyes settled on Mandri and an excited smile played on her lips.
“Mandri?” Obo asked, confused.
“Me?” Mandri echoed.
“You,” Pell said staunchly. “Why else would you be here before me now?”
Mandri’s dignity and vanity welled up his chest, for in no possible world would he assent to eating flesh or looking as foul as that putrid king. He raised his voice and declared, “I’m here because you killed my ox. I’m here because you—”
“Oh, please,” Pell moaned. “Do not bother me with trifles. Know that your grievances are Mandrameen’s, and that Mandrameen is an illusion. Mandrameen was born and he will die, but your real being knows neither beginning nor end. If you come with me into Shis, I can show you what I mean. You can bring your friends along.”
It was then that Mandri noticed a new thread of purpose manifested itself into being. It was drawn from his Spark and it led through Pell’s hip and disappeared behind her, through the doors of Shis.
Mandri took a step back.
“No,” he said firmly. “I’m not going anywhere with you.”
“Why else would you be here?” she asked, and she eased into a beatific smile. “Mandrameen, the portrait painter. You’ve painted a thousand faces, but never your own. You may have painted a self-portrait, but know that a true self-portrait is impossible. A mirror hardly helps—you can never capture that look of looking away. And worse, your eyes always see straight into themselves. You are always alert. You are always alive. You are always there. But you have never seen yourself sleeping. You will never see what you look like when you’re dead. Everyone else’s eyes close and will close forever, but you’re own…who’s to say it’s not the world that disappears every time you blink?”
“She’s mad,” Moteah mumbled.
Mandri agreed, but more off-putting than this witch’s rambling was the realization that he hadn’t blinked since the doors of Shis had opened. Maybe it had been longer, maybe not since the God’s Eye burgeon took hold hold of him. And more than this, Pell had locked her gaze with his, and for a shuttered instant, her true eyes flashed, glowing gold, declaring mystic tidings which Mandri could not comprehend but he could feel—bright, and warm, and thankful.
Then she blinked and her eyes went dark again.
“Do you sleep, Mandrameen? Do you sleep? What happens to Mandrameen when you sleep? Where does he go?”
“I… I’ve never thought about it.”
“Good,” she said. “You’re honest. That’s more than I can say for those who seek an end to their suffering.”
“Kill her already!” Moto pleaded.
Pell seemed pleased to hear Moto’s voice crack.
“Look at your friends,” she said as she flicked her beady eyes over the strong-backed Zosan. “See how frightened they are of dying. Why? All they’ll lose are their illusions. When you merge their Sparks with yours, they shall know peace.”
“Aren’t you forgetting about me?” Obo said as he readjusted himself atop Mandri’s shoulder. He was peeved to not be the center of attention.
Pell ignored him. She stepped aside to clear a path towards the open doors behind her, and she held out an entreating arm, and with the other, she seemed to pet the thread of purpose which led into the void. “Come Mandri. Do not worry about the darkness. Your eyes will adjust.”
Mandri stood dumbstruck at the sight of that thread of purpose leading him astray.
He felt his Spark tug at his gut, urging him forward.
He could feel it burn, and he winced in pain as seared his stomach’s lining. And as quickly as he could manage, he pulled Elrahet’s golden knife from out of his robe, and he slashed that bright white cord in two. The thread of purpose burst into a sprinkle of white-hot.
Pell’s smirk shattered into a wrinkling frown.
Moto and Moteah traded looks, unaware of what just happened.
Obo face, for the first time, scrunched up in confusion.
Pell gazed upon them all, and her disgusted frown curdled into a withering scowl.
“Gentle Sparks,” she said aloud, throwing her voice out into the cavern, “Would you grace us with your presence?”
Her request fell into the black, and a moment later the black began stir. Mandri tried to rub the insanity out of his eyes, but yes, the black itself began to stir, and as it weaved and wound like liquid smoke it squelched out growls and shrieks. Bright points of light emerged within it like swallowed stars, and these stars mounded up and grew brighter into full grown Sparks. Then came the pinching laughter of demons—not just two, or three, or twenty demons, for that sky of Sparks was joined by a horde of torch reflecting eyes. Thousands of blinking eyes in a thousand different configurations, all hovering there in the dark—eyes set wide, bovine eyes, mousey eyes, saucer eyes of squid, eight-fold sets of spider eyes swaying overhead. 
The first demon to reveal itself was a naked knuckle-walking monkey, vaguely human, with a mouthless face that was scrunched up towards the middle, as if its lips were stuffed up into its nose. Then another set of glowing eyes stepped forth into the light, revealing itself to be a goat headed demon with black Zosan skin and a chiseled physique, and it stood on ungulate legs complete with cloven hooves. This demon was joined by a circle of new grotesqueries, each leaping out, it seemed, from Mandri’s childhood dreams. Every manner of mashed-up anatomy between man, insect, and beast, and this circle of dread surrounded him and his companions, a circle broken only by Pell and the doors of Shis behind her.
“You see,” Pell said, “If you have come to offer yourselves to the slaughter, then I accept.”
Mandri was stuck in shock at the sight of so great an evil—rank upon rank of evil. Enough evil here to bring about the end of days.
“Hold on,” said Obo, unconcerned. “These demons here, they want to kill me?”
“Nothing so crude,” Pell replied. “They put your Spark back in its rightful place.”
One of the demons nearest Mandri, a tusked woman with the body of a boar snarled and hissed, spraying Mandri’s leg with its stinking spittle.
“She is hungry,” Pell said, amused.
“I’m afraid that this is all unacceptable.”
His nonchalant ___ jolted Pell into amazement. Her thin lips grew tight, her brows jumped, and then she burst into a tremendous fit of laughter, a cackle which was taken up by her demon horde and escalated into a roar.
“Oh, my, my!” she said. “Not acceptable?! My dear creature, we have collected an uncountable number of Sparks throughout the ages. Yours will be no different.”
“Of that uncountable number, how many belonged to Mazid?”
“We have collected the Sparks of gods. I assure you, yours will be no different.”
“Then it seems a peaceable conclusion is not possible.”
“It never was,” Pell confirmed.
“Very well,” said Obo, and he opened his mouth. His throat ran gold and fire poured out in a beam as bright as the sun, smashing through the air where Pell had been. The old witch had expected this turn, and she flew away in a blur before the heat could singe her.
Obo’s blazing fire smashed into the left door of Shis—such was its power that pushed through the stone as easily it would push through a slab of skin. Such was the dazzling brilliance of this roaring flame that it surprised even Obo.
Pell’s voice screamed out from the void, “FEAST!” 
In response, the sea of demons began to chatter.
Teeth chatter, giggle chatter, yapping-sucking-squealing chatter.
To Mandri’s horror, he saw threads of guiding purpose spool out of these demon’s Sparks and latch onto his own. All told, it was net of purpose so thick it might as well have been a blanket. Then black, goat-headed demon took a step forward. Next to move was a fish-headed bear giant. They both loomed large in distance, and as they sniffed the air Moteah screamed, “You’ve doomed us!”
“Relax,” said Obo, “We can all survive this. If you keep low and—”
His instructions were cut short by the hunting shriek of a demon swooping down from overhead. This bat-winged beast was the size of a child, with a child’s flat face and enormous funnel ears that wrapped around its goofy head to frame its pea-sized eyes. It reached down with its feet and splayed its curved claws wide, then suddenly, the creature’s head was wooshed away by a roaring burst of Mazidfire. The flame so hot that it heated the demon’s chest into incandescence. The whole headless body burst into flames and it hurtled overhead like a meteor before crashing into the crowd of demons behind. 
With the first blow struck, all Shis broke loose.
The demons came running, hopping, sliding, striding, galloping towards Mandri and the others. Scales sparkled and muscles bulged, whiskered snouts snapped and fanged maws hissed, pointed beaks screamed for oblivion—but Obo’s golden fire screamed back. He swung his coruscating fire in two great sweeping arcs, and he cut down a circle around Mandri, Moto, and Moteah , obliterating the first rank of evil, cutting the confidence out of that goat-headed demon at the waist. Those that scurried underneath Obo’s sweeping flame—the dog, hog, and lizard demons, the beetle demons—these Obo dispatched with incredible precision and blinding speed as more than twenty beams of fire flared out of his mouth in space of a breath, vaporizing the head of each demented creature on contact. When the Mazidfire was gone, the smoking bodies burst into flame, leaving a ring of sizzling flesh to serve as stumbling blocks to the rest of the onrushing horde. 
Moto and Moteah gathered close to Mandri, close to Obo, who danced atop Mandri’s shoulder. His fire spiraled round and round, and at each each turn his flame traveled further out, mowing down larger and larger swathes of demons, and as his golden beam purified the dark it left in its wake a smattering of little explosions as those who fell combusted. 
But the demons were undeterred by the slaughter. On they came, and it was not bravery, it was single-minded purpose driving them to consume all Sparks. On and on they came. Thousands. Blasts them out of the sky, beam beam beam. More were flooding in from unseen holes in the faraway ceiling. Their rippling backs glinted against the flash of Mazidfire, revealing a writhing mass of demons, a swarm pouring forth to protect their nest.
Each of them were tethered by shimmering threads to the Sparks huddled on the floor. Obo’s fire spiraled through this stringy assemblage of purpose, and one by one these threads burst into mist as their sources were snuffed out. And this amongst the roar of fire and demons, Mandri was pricked by the thought that Obo must be a god, for he had the power to extinguish threads of inevitable purpose. Obo stood supreme on Mandri’s shoulder, and Mandri not contain himself as he whooped his excitement. Obo—disgraceful, graceful, pitiful, glorious Obo—was turning away the army of Shis all by himself.
Mandri’s eyes welled up with tears, as being so close to such awesome power was overwhelming. He also cried from the pain when Obo pulled sharply on his hair to keep from falling. But mostly the tears were honest sentiment, awe and fascination. Obo’s pale skin glowed hot as the golden fire poured out of him, and for Mandri, that heat warm like the sun. He basked in its radiance. He craned his neck to view his savior’s face, and he marveled at the quickness of Obo’s eyes, darting from evil to evil, scouring them with his light.
Then something in his neck snapped, and his silver eyes rolled back in their sockets as a worrisome bulge extruded out the side of his white-hot neck.
Then it burst.
Mandri screamed in horror as a gout of golden fire fountained out of that hole in Obo’s throat. Its heat was terrifying, and the force of its surge split the rest of Obo’s neck right open. Then came a final, sputtering flash of gold, and Obo’s head peeled back onto his shoulders
Obo’s fingers lost their grip on Mandri’s hair.
He fell off his perch.
Mandri twisted round and caught the falling Mazid.
“What happened!?” Moteah cried as she scanned the black sky above for some sign of assault, but there were only streamers of flame as dead fell to the ground.
“Is it dead?” Moto asked as he propped Obo’s head up, hoping the front of the Mazid’s neck might reattach. But Obo’s eyes did not list from their split-eyed gaze, and his body was fully limp.
Instinct prodded Mandri to look for demons—Obo had cleared a wide, flaming circle around them, a lake of combusted corpses, but Obo had not killed them all. A thousand threads of murderous purpose stretched through the flames and latched on to Obo’s golden Spark
Mandri wrenched up in rage.
“NO!”
He grabbed hold of his golden knife, and he slashed at those strangling threads as he’d seen Elrahet do. His wild flailing nearly slashed Moto’s hand, but he didn’t care, he slashed out again, and again, and again, and with each slicing stroke, bundles of these puppetry strings fell away, but grew right back, rejoining themselves to Obo’s Spark.
“They come!” Moteah wailed, and her frightened cry was chased by a bout of cackling laughter as Pell watched the despair from the dark above. She swooped down, and her black robe billowed like smoke. she landed on the back of a dead demon, a bloated toad-man whose long tongue rolled out on the floor. Her alighting was weightless, and the sight of her beaming smile filled Mandri with rage.
She was unmoored by purpose. It was her, her golden Spark, and that was it—no demon purpose troubled her, no god’s purpose either. In her hand was her own golden blade, and somehow she was free from the puppetry of purpose. But Mandri did not need a bright white thread to read her future, for she licked her long teeth at the sight of Obo’s Spark.
That would not do.
He took his knife and ripped a gash right down Obo’s chest, all the way down to the belly. He reached in and pulled at the ribs, which seemed to unbuckle from the gleaming white sternum, and he opened it like the wing of a cage. When Mandri saw his own severed hand laying there in the goop, he burst into tears, for it was the only part of him that had done anyone any good, and there it lay, unused.
And there below it was Obo’s spherical, purple stomach. Inside was Obo’s golden Spark. Mandri did not know what to do with it. He only knew he didn’t want Pell to have it. More than anything he’d ever wanted, he wanted to stop that old witch from swallowing this blessed Spark. 
But how to stop her?
A golden knife was not enough to intrude on the cosmic war that has been ra

Mandri reached down with his blade and nicked the stomach’s wet curve. He then set his lips upon the hole and slurped.
The liquid Spark flooded into his mouth and it washed his with divine ___.
He swallowed.
Moto and Moteah watched him with eyes agog, almost forgetting the onrushing demon horde. The Spark slimed down his throat, it dropped into his stomach, and when it merged with Mandri’s own he melted into bliss, bliss, joy, love and ecstasy enfolding sorrow and grief. And here, in this he was struck by. Self versus indominiable self. Illusions into reality. Reality into illusion. Becoming unbecoming, reversals interchangeable, movements reverberating through all of the present and the future.



When he came to, and saw the demons moving through the, he shouted, “STOP!”
He reached with his blade, and with a flick of his wrist, the net of murderous purpose around him snapped and turned to mist. He did the same for his two companions, and a heartbeat later, and the onrushing demon horde came at once to a stop.
Feels Moto and Moteah’s purpose.
“Put down the blade, boy, you know not what you wield.”
She let her aggravation ___.
“I will hunt you for a thousand years, as I have hunted her. I will kill you as I have killed her! I will grind you down as I will grind the world!”

I’ve heard Elrahet’s story. I’ve heard her name Solraheen a proud father. He willingly died to free His creation from all influence. But He is dead, and His purpose drives you still. Why? Why!? He is dead, and yet he is still here. Only by Schisol’s grace, am I free of this falseness.
By Solraheen’s, I am free of yours.
“No, that is Elrahet’s doing. She was as obsessed with purpose. Her purpose, no one else’s. But no matter. 
You weak and pitiful. Dent in the . 
“Defend yourself. No one else can. Mandrameen is your lie, not theirs.”
S wims through the visible arcs of Moto and Moteah’s blades.

Sipped her spark.

Neither am I.

This is not Solraheen’s purpose. He is dead. This is your purpose, made by you and you alone.
Gods are dead. Natural purpose rises.</Text>

        <Title>Pre Obo Zooped</Title>
        <Text>Mandri did not have to look long for an unnatural hole which might lead down to Shis, as there was one in the cluttered study that lay adjacent to the throne room.
The king’s study.
Greskal’s study.
The man must have found some dark grimoire that lured him to seek succor in Shis. Or so Mandri supposed. Finding that book would be difficult, as it seemed every book in the room had its spine cut and its innards loosed, and sheets of paper were scattered about like moon moths. Some were stuck to the walls. Some alighted on the large upturned table that lay canted on the far side of the room, its legs sticking up like a bloated cow. Some paper fluttered on the rim of a shield-sized hole in the center of the floor. A green carpet hung down into that hole’s depths, a carpet ripped to rags by a track of claw marks. Ascending claw marks, judging from the direction of the rip.
Moto dropped his torch down into this hole, revealing a red rock floor some few meters away.
“This should be fun,” said Obo. Mandri agreed. He felt invincible with Obo staring over his shoulder, though he was a tad worried that if a snarling demon dripped down out of the black, Obo’s purging flame might singe his cheek.
Mandri paused to take a quick sip of his God’s Eye burgeon, for the God’s Eye sight had faded. Obo had preternatural senses, and he wanted them too, especially now that he’d be taking the lead. When he’d stowed that burgeon away nice and safe inside his robe, he jumped down into that hole and picked up Moto’s torch.
At first there was a single tunnel, and its walls were fixed in brick and reinforced with wooden beams, but these constructions soon gave way to a meandering maze of natural stone which felt as old as the world itself. Mandri led, torch in hand, then Moteah followed, with Moto following close behind. The air was alive with the sounds of footfalls and heavy breathing—some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight, no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons waiting for a chance to strike. After some tracking and backtracking through this maze, Mandri turned a tight corner and came upon a doorless stone arch of ordinary size. This arch’s posts were perfectly plumb and square, and unfamiliar symbols were etched into them.
Mandri hesitated.
“Cold feet?” Moteah asked behind him. 
Mandri’s feet were cold, but that had nothing to do with it. He waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock and asked of anyone, “Can you read this?”
“It’s Schisol’s creed,” Obo said.
Every good Jandri child knows the words to Schisol’s creed. It is a creed which has floated through the Old Jandri world since forever. Solitants address it in mocking tones to rob the words of their power. In Hrkan law, whenever the creed is written in text, each line must be accompanied by a marginal note that explains the utter foolishness of it.

Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth.	(Premise assumes conclusion)
Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right. 	(Ambiguous terms.)
Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.	(Demonstrably wrong.)
Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be together.	(Pseudoprofundity)

That final, ominous line has spurred many a suicide pact, despite demystification. Such events are the work of demons, Solitants say. Demons put it in people’s heads that they’ll be less lonely in Shis if they bring other people down with them. It explains murder-suicides too. It’s all the influence of demons. And here Mandri was, heading down to Shis, being followed.
“We should keep moving,” Moteah said as she nudged Obo’s litter.
Mandri could not take his sight from the threshold. The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of symbols. He dared to reach out and touch them, and he found the grooves to be free of dust. All of it was remarkably clean.
Obo’s reassuring voice popped into his ear. “Whatever’s down here, I’ll handle it.” He then gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder, and confidence returned to Mandri’s legs. He stepped through the gate.
What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone arch made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs, and that was barely enough to allow descent. This path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. As Mandri had only one hand, he gave his torch to Obo to hold. And again his confidence fled—Obo might be able to save him from demons, but he couldn’t chase away a deep abyss such as this. 
When he’d shimmied halfway across, he slipped on a loose shard of rock that went tumbling into the void. He was able to regain his balance fairly easily, but he didn’t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the abyss, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up from below. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him. Neither Moto nor Moteah said anything, and so they journeyed on.
The rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. In places, the walls were so narrow that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways. Obo had to walk, which for him meant swiveling along on his stubs. Next came a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill. He started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself. The torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable—hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows that looked like shallow divots gave way to potholes that twisted his ankle. But the longer it went on the less and less he cared about these scrapes and bruises, because the ways were much more up-and-down than anything in the desert, or even the Goree Pass, and an unremitting burn set into his thighs.
They rested for a while underneath a hang of rock. Moto set up a house of twigs, set them alight, and when these twigs burned to ash they moved on again. They walked for another long while, became sore again, rested again, and at this point no one could agree on whether it was night or day above.
The God’s Eye sight came to Mandri on the third march. First came that familiar flash of white. His vision was flooded with a cosmic swirl of shimmering brightness, and when Mandri shucked his mind free of this blinding vision, he could see everyone’s Sparks stirring in their stomachs. Obo’s gold Spark outshone them all, but bright as he was, bright as they all were, they illuminated nothing. The dark dominion was oppressive, nothing like the Sand above, where even the rocks were coated with fibrous purpose. Down here the rocks were dead, and the only threads of purpose he could see were those which connected their Sparks, as well as those few threads which stretched out of their Sparks and into the tunnel ahead, drawing out the paths which they would walk.
Mandri followed his own thread of purpose and traced its movement with his stomach-dwelling Spark.
It was strange, seeing the future.
Following it was even stranger—did he follow it because he could see it and wanted to know where it went? Or did he follow it because it drew him along like some sort of puppet. The others were puppeted along, no doubt, as they couldn’t see what he saw. They couldn’t see the threads, and so they couldn’t see the choice, much less make one.
Then they came to a fork in the tunnel. All threads of purpose chose to wander right. Moto and Moteah argued about which way to go. Mandri stayed silent. Obo claimed he could hear faint echoes coming from the right, and so they chose to head right.
But Mandri knew that turning right was not a choice. The noise that Obo heard had a cause, and that cause was also caused, and so causes carry on in an infinite regress which could only end in the hand of Solraheen weaving a desired future. Mandri truly believed that this thread he followed was put there by Solraheen, and it was this great faith that comPeled him to see it through.
Soon, the way spilled out into a short, brickworked hall, and his shoes slapped onto flat stone tile. This hall then opened up into a cavern whose size was difficult to estimate. It was large enough to hide the echoes of their shuffling feet, so it must have been larger than Shulgi’s throne room. And the entirety of this cavern floor was paved in tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps or so, the floor’s simple square pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. 
This black sun was an unfamiliar design, like a flower with its petals closed and all points pointing inwards. In some sense, it was the opposite of the eightfold Jandri sun. Mandri took it to be a sign of Schisol, and he did not stop to study any of them. He hunched along as if sneaking. He almost laughed at the sight of Moto and Moteah skulking along behind, because if any demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they’d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches.
But there were no demons. In all the blackness around them, there were no demons or demon Sparks. And there weren’t any threads of purpose sPeling out their doom. There was only that faint swirl of guiding purpose floating in front of them and disappearing into the dark. 
They walked through this cavern for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern’s end. The purpose ended here—they could go no further. The stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a monstrous stone double-door that would require a team of oxen to open. These doors seemed sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures mostly, snarling demons doing unmentionable things to men and women unfleshed.
Set atop these doors was a stone head, bald like Obo’s, and twice as unnerving because it seemed to be licking its lips at sight of Mandri’s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders. The rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly limbs stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door’s bottom hinges.
Moteah eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn. “What do we do now?”
Mandri was dismayed to see his thread of purpose knot up at the base of the door. “I don’t know,” he said. “I think I just stand here and…”
“Knock?” said Moto.
Mandri reached out to knock, but there wasn’t a clean spot for it. The door’s panel was too full of sculpted, snarling demons. In the end he made no decision, as a thread of purpose alighted out of nothing to guide his knuckles toward the forehead of an anguished man who was being yanked along by hooks set into his skin.
The sound of Mandri’s knock was soft and barely there, two quick raps.
He took a step back, and waited.
He did not wait long, for out of the air around him there arose a voice, a woman’s voice, a voice as old and aggrieved as Elrahet’s.
“Come in,” it said, and it was followed by the sound of stone grinding against stone as these great doors of Shis swiveled in their hinges. They swiveled inward, and the doors’ two halves split to reveal a split of black. Tucked inside this darkness was a golden Spark.
The Spark floated forth and the torchlight revealed its figure—an old woman, tall and graceful, robed in a single black satin sheet that draped down to the floor but did not touch. Mandri recognized her long nose and imperious glare instantly—it was Pel.
It was the demon-witch who’d killed is ox back on his farm in Meskalim. The witch who’d set this all into motion, if causes could begin with her. Foul causes surely did. Not Solraheen’s hand, but Schisol’s.
Moto and Moteah drew their swords.
Pel drew a thin lipped smile.
“Oh, please,” she said to them, “Where are your manners?”
Obo, confident in his litter, said to the siblings, “Put your swords away.”
They both hesitated, but when Moteah sheathed her sword, so did Moto.
“Thank you,” said Pel. “And thank you,” she said as she cast an adoring eye upon Mandri. “You don’t know how long I’ve been trying to end Elrahet, and you managed it perfectly.”
Mandri could not speak. He was entranced by the sight of Pel’s Spark. It was gold, like Elrahet’s, like Obo’s, though it was completely devoid of purpose. Not a single thread in all the world was attached to it.
“Tongue tied?” Pel asked as she glided effortlessly towards him. “Do I frighten you? Speak, Mandrameen. This is your moment.” 
Moto was the one to seize it. “Mazid, Kill her!”
Obo climbed out of his litter and he sat on Mandri’s shoulder like an overgrown cat. He rested his elbow on Mandri’s head and said to Pel, “I’ve heard stories about you.”
“Such irony. A creature spends its short life searching for freedom, and found it by enslaving a Spark.”
“As may be,” said Obo. “But they say that you are my enemy, that you are a great evil, and that I should kill you.”
Pel stood there silently. She was either unwilling or unable to respond. Her face betrayed nothing, set as it was in a stony glare.
Obo said, “Have you nothing to say in your defense?”
Pel curled her lip. “Nothing I say will change what you will do. You will all do what you will.”
“That is a curious turn of phrase,” said Obo. “But, help me understand, was it you who corrupted the old king Greskal and brought forth the Amalgamete?”
“None but the Amalgamete can bring forth the Amalgamete.”
Moto was sweating rain despite the cavern’s chill. He shouted, “Why are you talking to her? Kill her!”
Pel rolled her eyes at the outburst. “Don’t fret, child, I am not the one who condemned you. That was Solraheen, your benevolent, loving, murderous god.”
“She’s Schisol’s shadow—kill her!”
“I am Schisol’s shadow, yes, and proud of it! Know that Solraheen is false and he does not love you. Know that Solraheen never called down that rock of Fabled Black to kill Himself and save the world. Know that this was done by Schisol, know that He sacrificed himself for your sakes, that Solraheen could no longer torture your Sparks.”
“Do you have any proof of your claims?” Obo asked. “Or do witchy women only speak in stories?”
“The proof is the peace that is soon to come. A peace which you will find in the belly of the Amalgamete.”
“I’ve killed your Amalgamete.”
Pel deflected this triumph away with a twitch of her sharp chin. “Another will come. In fact, he stands now on my doorstep.”
Her eyes settled on Mandri and an excited smile played on her lips.
“Mandri?” Obo asked, confused.
“Me?” Mandri echoed.
“You,” Pel said staunchly. “Why else would you be here before me now?”
Mandri’s dignity and vanity welled up his chest, for in no possible world would he assent to eating flesh or looking as foul as that putrid king. He raised his voice and declared, “I’m here because you killed my ox. I’m here because you—”
“Oh, please,” Pel moaned. “Do not bother me with trifles. Know that your grievances are Mandrameen’s, and that Mandrameen is an illusion. Mandrameen was born and he will die, but your real being knows neither beginning nor end. Come with me into Shis, I can show you what I mean. You can bring your friends along.”
It was then that Mandri noticed a new thread of purpose manifesting itself into being. It was drawn from his Spark and it led through Pel’s hip and disappeared behind her, through the doors of Shis.
Mandri took a step back.
“No,” he said firmly. “I’m not going anywhere with you.”
“Why else would you be here?” she asked, and her jagged lips eased into a beatific smile. “Mandrameen, the portrait painter. You’ve painted a thousand faces, but never your own. You may have painted a self-portrait, but know that a true self-portrait is impossible. A mirror hardly helps—you can never capture that look of looking away. And worse, your eyes always see straight into themselves. You are always alert. You are always alive. You are always there. But you have never seen yourself sleeping. You will never see what you look like when you’re dead. Everyone else’s eyes close and will close forever, but you’re own…who’s to say it’s not the world that disappears every time you blink?”
“She’s mad,” Moteah mumbled.
Mandri agreed, but more off-putting than this witch’s rambling was the realization that he hadn’t blinked since the doors of Shis had opened. Maybe it had been longer, maybe not since the God’s Eye burgeon took hold of him. And more than this, Pel had locked her gaze with his, and for a shuttered instant, her true eyes flashed, glowing gold, declaring mystic tidings which Mandri could not comprehend but he could feel—bright, and warm, and thankful.
Then she blinked and her eyes went dark again.
“Do you sleep, Mandrameen? Do you sleep? What happens to Mandrameen when you sleep? Where does he go?”
“I… I’ve never thought about it.”
“Good,” she said. “You’re honest. That’s more than I can say for those who seek an end to their suffering.”
“Kill her already!” Moto pleaded.
Pel seemed pleased to hear Moto’s voice crack.
“Look at this man,” she said as she flicked her beady eyes over the strong-backed Zosan. “See how frightened he is of dying. What does he fear? All he’ll lose are his illusions. Merge his Spark with yours and he shall know peace.”
“Aren’t you forgetting about me?” Obo asked as he readjusted himself atop Mandri’s shoulder. He was peeved to not be the center of attention, and he grunted when Pel ignored him. She stepped aside to clear a path towards the open doors behind her, and she held out an entreating arm towards Mandri, and with the back of her hand, she brushed the thread of purpose which led into the void. “Come young Mandrameen. Do not worry about the darkness, your eyes will adjust.”
Mandri stood dumbstruck at the sight of that thread of purpose leading him astray, and he gasped when he realized that he’d taken a single step forward.
As quickly as he could manage, he pulled Elrahet’s golden knife from out of his robe, and he slashed that bright white cord in two.
The thread of purpose burst into a spark-sprinkled mist, and Pel’s smirk shattered into a wrinkling frown.
“Whose purpose do you think you’ve cut!?” she snipped.
Moto and Moteah traded confused looks, unaware of what just happened, and for the first time ever, Obo’s hairless brow scrunched up like paper. “What is she talking about?” he asked.
Pel’s frown curdled into a withering scowl as she replied, “I speak of purpose! Your purpose. Mandrameen’s. All the gods are dead, they no longer weave their purpose into our world. All purpose is yours.” She stared down her long nose at Mandri. “The thread you cut was your own. You put it there, no one else. Yet that frightened you. Why?”
“Because I don’t want to do what you want me to do.”
“Hah! Yes! We speak with Mandrameen! He sees through everyone’s manipulations except his own. Typical. Typical of you all. You slavers of Sparks. You sifters of Selves. Pool your purpose together, and still it will fade.” She turned her scouring stare to the darkness of the cavern, and she threw her voice out into it, saying, “Gentler Sparks….would you grace us with your presence?”
Her request fell into the black, and a moment later the black began stir. Mandri tried to rub the insanity out of his eyes, but yes, the black itself began to stir, and as it weaved and wound like liquid smoke it squelched out growls and shrieks. Bright points of light emerged within it like swallowed stars, and these stars mounded up and grew brighter into full grown Sparks. Then came the pinching laughter of demons—not just two, or three, or twenty demons, for that sky of Sparks was joined by a horde of torch reflecting eyes. Thousands of blinking eyes in a thousand different configurations, all hovering there in the dark—eyes set wide, bovine eyes, mousey eyes, saucer eyes of squid, eightfold sets of spider eyes swaying overhead. 
The first demon to reveal itself was a naked knuckle-walking monkey, vaguely human, with a mouthless face that was scrunched up towards the middle, as if its lips were stuffed up into its nose. Then another set of glowing eyes stepped forth into the light, revealing itself to be a goat headed demon with black Zosan skin and a chiseled physique, and it stood on ungulate legs complete with cloven hooves. This demon was joined by a circle of new grotesqueries, each leaping out, it seemed, from Mandri’s childhood dreams. Every manner of mashed-up anatomy between man, insect, and beast, and this circle of dread surrounded him and his companions, a circle broken only by Pel and the doors of Shis behind her.
“You see,” Pel said, “If you have come to offer yourselves to the slaughter, then I accept.”
Mandri was stuck in shock at the sight of so great an evil—rank upon rank of evil. Enough evil here to bring about the end of days.
“Hold on,” said Obo, unconcerned. “These demons here, they want to kill me?”
“Nothing so crude,” Pel replied. “They simply want to put your Spark back into its rightful place.”
One of the demons nearest Mandri, a tusked woman with the body of a boar snarled and hissed, spraying Mandri’s leg with its stinking spittle.
“She is hungry,” Pel said, amused.
“I’m afraid that this is all unacceptable.”
Obo’s repudiation jolted Pel into amazement. Her thin lips grew tight, her brows jumped, and then she burst into a tremendous fit of laughter, a cackle which was taken up by her demon horde and escalated into a roar.
“Oh, my, my!” she said. “Unacceptable?! My dear creature, we have collected an uncountable number of Sparks throughout the ages. Yours will be no different.”
“Of that uncountable number, how many belonged to Mazid?”
“We have collected the Sparks of gods. I assure you, yours will be no different.”
“Then it seems a peaceable conclusion to our disagreement is not possible.”
“It never was.”
“Very well,” said Obo, and he opened his mouth. His throat ran gold and fire poured out in a beam as bright as the sun, smashing through the air where Pel had been—had been. The old witch expected this turn, and she’d flown away in a blur before Obo’s fire could singe her. Instead, his burst of blazing flame smashed into the doors of Shis.
“Huh,” Obo sputtered. “She’s fast for an old bat.”
Then Pel’s voice screamed out from the void above, “FEAST!”
That word was, as far as witchy pronouncements go, frighteningly unambiguous. It set the sea of demons to chattering—teeth chatter, giggle chatter, yapping-sucking-squealing chatter, and to Mandri’s horror, he saw threads of guiding purpose spool out of these demon’s Sparks and latch onto his own, and onto Obo’s, and onto Moto’s and and Moteah’s. There were so many demons and so many threads that the purpose was thick as a blanket, a circular blanket that split when a black, goat-headed demon took a step forward from the demon’s circle. Next to it was a fish-headed bear giant, and they both loomed large and snarled.
“Relax,” said Obo without a hint of worry, “We can all survive this. If you keep low and—”
The hunting shriek of a demon screeched out as the beast swooped down upon them. This demon was truly frightening—bat-winged and the size of a child, with a child’s flat face and enormous funnel ears that wrapped around its goofy head to frame its pea-sized eyes. It reached down with its feet and splayed its finger-talons wide, and just as it made to shriek again, its whole head was wooshed away by a roaring burst of Mazidfire.
The flame was so hot that it heated the demon’s chest into incandescence. The headless body burst into flames and hurtled overhead like a meteor before crashing into the crowd of demons behind. 
As the first blow struck, all Shis broke loose.
Demons came running, hopping, sliding, striding, galloping towards Mandri and the others. Scales sparkled and muscles bulged, whiskered snouts snapped and fanged maws hissed, pointed beaks screamed for oblivion—but Obo’s golden fire screamed back. He swung his coruscating flame in two great sweeping arcs, and he cut down a circle around Mandri, Moto, and Moteah, obliterating the first rank of evil, cutting the confidence out of that goat-headed demon at the waist. Those that scurried underneath Obo’s sweeping flame—the dog, hog, and lizard demons, the beetle demons—these Obo dispatched with incredible precision and blinding speed as more than twenty beams of fire flared out of his mouth in space of a breath, vaporizing the head of each demented creature on contact. Every smoking corpse burst into flame, leaving a ring of sizzling flesh to serve as stumbling blocks to the rest of the onrushing horde. 
Moto and Moteah gathered close to Mandri, close to Obo, who danced atop Mandri’s shoulder and dealt death to this demon horde. His fire spiraled round and round, and at each turn his flame traveled further out, mowing down larger and larger swathes of evil. In the wake of his golden beam was a smattering of distant explosions as those who fell combusted. 
But the demons were undeterred by the slaughter. On they came. It was not bravery, it was dumb, single-minded evil which drove them to consume all Sparks. And on and on they came. Thousands. Obo blasted birds and bats and all manner of giant insects out of the sky. But more flew and climbed out from unseen holes in the faraway ceiling. Their rippling backs glinted against the flash of Mazidfire, and it seemed the very skin of the cavern rock was writhing, for the swarm of Shis poured forth to protect their nest.
Each of them were tethered by shimmering threads to Mandri’s Spark, yet Obo’s fire spiraled through them all, and one by one these threads burst into mist as their sources were snuffed out. Amongst the roar of fire and agony, Mandri was pricked by the thought that Obo might be a god, a new god for a new age, a god who could conquer malignant purpose. And this little god stood supreme on Mandri’s shoulders, and Mandri could not contain himself as he whooped his excitement. Obo—disgraceful, graceful, pitiful, glorious Obo—was turning away the army of Shis all by himself.
Mandri’s eyes welled up with tears, as being so close to such awesome power was overwhelming. He also cried from the pain as Obo pulled sharply on his hair to keep from falling. But mostly the tears were due to honest awe and fascination. Obo’s pale skin glowed hot as the golden fire poured out of him, and for Mandri, that heat was the sun. He basked in its radiance. He craned his neck to view his savior’s face, and he marveled at the quickness of Obo’s eyes, darting from evil to evil, scouring them with his light.
Then something in Obo’s neck snapped, a muscle or tendon, and Obo’s silver eyes rolled back in their sockets as his flame continued to ruin the dark. His head tilted backwards, undirected, and a worrisome bulge extruded out the side of his white-hot neck until it burst.
Mandri screamed in horror as a gout of golden fire fountained out of that hole in Obo’s throat. Its heat was terrifying, and the force of its surge split the rest of Obo’s neck wide open. Then came a final, sputtering flash of gold, and Obo’s head peeled all the way back onto his shoulders. His fingers lost their grip on Mandri’s hair, and he fell off his perch.
Mandri twisted round and caught the falling Mazid.
“What happened!?” Moteah cried as she scanned the black sky above for some renewed assault which Obo might have missed, but there was only a rain of streaming flames as dead demons fell to the ground.
“Is it dead?” Moto asked as he propped Obo’s head up, hoping the front of Obo’s neck might reattach. But Obo’s eyes did not list from their split-eyed gaze, and his body was fully limp.
Obo had cleared a wide, flaming circle around them, a lake of combusted corpses, but Obo had not killed them all. A thousand threads of murderous purpose stretched through the flames and latched on to Obo’s golden Spark
Mandri wrenched up in rage.
“NO!”
He grabbed hold of his golden knife, and he slashed at those strangling threads as he’d seen Elrahet do. His wild flailing nearly slashed Moto’s hand, but he didn’t care, he slashed out again, and again, and again, and with each slicing stroke, bundles of these puppetry strings fell away and grew right back, rejoining themselves to Obo’s Spark.
“They come!” Moteah wailed, and her frightened cry was chased by a bout of cackling laughter as Pel spied their despair from the dark above. She swooped down, and her black robe billowed like smoke as she alighted upon the back of a smoldering toad-man demon whose long tongue rolled out on the floor. The sight of her beaming smile filled Mandri with rage.
In her hand was her golden blade, and her golden Spark was free from the net of purpose which enmeshed everything else. But Mandri did not need to see a bright white thread to know her purpose, for she licked her long teeth at the sight of Obo’s Spark.
That would not do.
Mandri took his golden knife and sliced open a gash right down Obo’s chest, all the way down to the belly. He reached in and pulled at the ribs, which easily unbuckled from the gleaming white sternum. It opened like the wing of a bird cage, and when Mandri saw his own severed hand laying there in the goop, he almost burst into tears, for that hand was the only part of him that had done anyone any good. There it lay, unused.
“Halt!” Pel shouted. The horde of demons halted by her side. The command was also meant for Mandri, and an anxious quiver split Pel’s lips. “Put down the knife,” she said. “You know not what you wield.”
Mandri gripped the knife more tightly. He looked down at Obo’s spherical stomach which listed in the oozing, smoking mess that was Obo’s insides. And there was Obo’s golden Spark. Mandri did not know what to do with it. He only knew that he didn’t want Pel to have it. More than anything he’d ever wanted, he wanted to stop that old witch from swallowing this blessed Spark. 
He reached down with his blade and nicked the stomach’s wet curve. An amber juice spilled out and mixed in with the rest of Obo’s muck.
And the Spark was there, bright as ever. A glorious sliver of its golden light peeped through the hole in the membrane and muscle.
Mandri hesitated.
He looked for a thread of purpose connecting him to it. Was he supposed to do it? Could he choose?
He saw nothing but the threads of others. Nothing connecting him.
Then Pel let loose a wild scream and took flight. She shot straight for him, and the shock of her gnashing teeth nearly cowed Mandri like it had done back on his farm in Meskalim.
He bent and sipped that liquid Spark into his mouth, then swallowed.
The Spark slimed down his throat.
Pel, flying furious, dodged Moto and Moteah’s swinging swords for their savage arcs were betrayed by arcs of preceding purpose. And just before her gnashing teeth smacked into Mandri’s chest, Obo’s golden Spark merged with Mandri’s own.
At once he was struck by both the witch and an all encompassing bliss. His body crashed to the floor while his mind was lost in senseless joy. Nothing mattered. This wasn’t despair, this was liberation. He was at the bottom of being, and down there was a warmth there that he could dwell. There was a presence there. He was being hugged. Somehow, Obo was with him, as was Elrahet, and that gnawing loneliness which plagued him since he came wailing out of his mother’s womb was gone, gone as if it were never there.
He was brought back to reality by Pel’s haunting laughter.
He lay on the ground, and she was kneeling over him. The brightness of her Spark was dazzling. The brightness of his own Spark glinted in her eyes, but she did not move to feast. And in the depths of Mandri’s bliss, her smile took on new meaning. Instead of delighting in his fear, she seemed satisfied, as if his swallowing of the Spark were a job well done.
“Beautiful,” she muttered as she marveled at Mandri’s joy. And more than admiration, the look in her eyes was one of longing. She locked her gaze with his, and Mandri could feel the emotion pouring out of her as vividly as if she were his mother, a lover, a dearest friend, a most hated enemy. All their history felt tied together, and this was a final parting.
“You see, don’t you, that there is a being greater than yourself.”
She then raised her knife in the air and brought it down upon her own belly. She ripped the gash wide with a pained jerk. Blood poured over her fingers, and with her free hand, she reached in, grabbed her stomach, and yanked out of her belly.
Her stomach’s mouth had been severed, but the attached intestines trailed along like a horrible, squelching, worm. she lowered her stomach’s open lip to Mandri’s awestruck mouth.
“Savor the taste,” she wheezed as she tipped her stomach like a wine bag.
Her Spark spilled out and it forced its way into Mandri’s throat. Reality twanged as Schisol’s gift merged with Solraheen’s—twinned divinities combined into one.
Mandri felt he might explode.
His flesh was not built to house this power.
He coughed.
His stomach wretched.
Pel’s bony hands fell upon his mouth and forced his jaw shut. With each new breath, her strength dwindled, and as the seed of divinity took root in a stomach fold, she fell back. The smack of her shoulders against the ground forced out the sigh of long ages.
With her death, the net of purpose which bound the horde of demons snapped. Their snarling, spitting, chatter went silent, and they all stood dumb as cattle. Moto and Moteah huddled together, dumbfounded by all they had just witnessed. The nearest demon, a bubble-backed ox with a single fang, stood dumb. Out of its pink spark came a wiggling thread of purpose. It latched onto the nearest Spark, a sand cat demon with human limbs.
The Ox turned its great heat towards the cat.
Slobber dripped down its jowl, and it let loose a bovine bleat.
The whole cavern erupted into chaos as the demonic horde fell upon itself. Snake and fowl chased each other. Lizard-man squared off against lizard-woman. Fangs and fingernails ripped at every manner of stomach, and if any demon stopped to eat, its own flesh was torn.
Mandri jumped up with such vigor as he had never felt. He grabbed Pel’s golden knife out of her stomach, and he ran towards the huddled siblings. Their Sparks shone bright. They were almost all he could see. Moteah’s face was a blur. Moto’s voice seemed disembodied.
“We need to get out of here!” Moto screamed as a bat-man demon flew low, chasing a giant fly with the head of a purse-lipped fish.
Mandri handed Pel’s golden knife out to the blur that was Moto.
“Swing it in the air,” he said.
“What?”
Mandri lashed out with his own golden knife and cut a thread of insatiable purpose as it wandered towards Moto’s hip.
“Just start swinging and follow me!”
He raced away. The siblings followed, and he charted a certain path through the ravenous, self-defeating horde. He hopped over flailing tail and limb, and he slid under a giant man-stork’s strides. He paused every now then to make sure that threads which snuck by Moto’s flailing knife were cut away. 
They ran and ran, and all the while, Mandri was losing his sense of bliss. Fear crept in between heavy breaths—not fear of demons, he could avoid them easily. Fear of something else. Something much deeper. Something that he’d swallowed.</Text>

        <Text>Mandri did not have to look long for an unnatural hole which might lead down to Shis, as there was one in the cluttered study that lay adjacent to the throne room.
The king’s study.
Greskal’s study.
The man must have found some dark grimoire that lured him to seek succor in Shis. Or so Mandri supposed. Finding that book would be difficult, as it seemed every book in the room had its spine cut and its innards loosed, and sheets of paper were scattered about like moon moths. Some were stuck to the walls. Some alighted on the large upturned table that lay canted on the far side of the room, its legs sticking up like a bloated cow. Some paper fluttered on the rim of a shield-sized hole in the center of the floor. A green carpet hung down into that hole’s depths, a carpet ripped to rags by a track of claw marks. Ascending claw marks, judging from the direction of the rip.
Moto dropped his torch down into this hole, revealing a red rock floor some few meters away.
“This should be fun,” said Obo. Mandri agreed. He felt invincible with Obo staring over his shoulder, though he was a tad worried that if a snarling demon dripped down out of the black, Obo’s purging flame might singe his cheek.
Mandri paused to take a quick sip of his God’s Eye burgeon, for the God’s Eye sight had faded. Obo had preternatural senses, and he wanted them too, especially now that he’d be taking the lead. When he’d stowed that burgeon away nice and safe inside his robe, he jumped down into that hole and picked up Moto’s torch.
At first there was a single tunnel, and its walls were fixed in brick and reinforced with wooden beams, but these constructions soon gave way to a meandering maze of natural stone which felt as old as the world itself. Mandri led, torch in hand, then Moteah followed, with Moto following close behind. The air was alive with the sounds of footfalls and heavy breathing—some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight, no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons waiting for a chance to strike. After some tracking and backtracking through this maze, Mandri turned a tight corner and came upon a doorless stone arch of ordinary size. This arch’s posts were perfectly plumb and square, and unfamiliar symbols were etched into them.
Mandri hesitated.
“Cold feet?” Moteah asked behind him. 
Mandri’s feet were cold, but that had nothing to do with it. He waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock and asked of anyone, “Can you read this?”
“It’s Schisol’s creed,” Obo said.
Every good Jandri child knows the words to Schisol’s creed. It is a creed which has floated through the Old Jandri world since forever. Solitants address it in mocking tones to rob the words of their power. In Hrkan law, whenever the creed is written in text, each line must be accompanied by a marginal note that explains the utter foolishness of it.

Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth.	(Premise assumes conclusion)
Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right. 	(Ambiguous terms.)
Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.	(Demonstrably wrong.)
Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be together.	(Pseudoprofundity)

That final, ominous line has spurred many a suicide pact, despite demystification. Such events are the work of demons, Solitants say. Demons put it in people’s heads that they’ll be less lonely in Shis if they bring other people down with them. It explains murder-suicides too. It’s all the influence of demons. And here Mandri was, heading down to Shis, being followed.
“We should keep moving,” Moteah said as she nudged Obo’s litter.
Mandri could not take his sight from the threshold. The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of symbols. He dared to reach out and touch them, and he found the grooves to be free of dust. All of it was remarkably clean.
Obo’s reassuring voice popped into his ear. “Whatever’s down here, I’ll handle it.” He then gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder, and confidence returned to Mandri’s legs. He stepped through the gate.
What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone arch made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs, and that was barely enough to allow descent. This path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. As Mandri had only one hand, he gave his torch to Obo to hold. And again his confidence fled—Obo might be able to save him from demons, but he couldn’t chase away a deep abyss such as this. 
When he’d shimmied halfway across, he slipped on a loose shard of rock that went tumbling into the void. He was able to regain his balance fairly easily, but he didn’t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the abyss, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up from below. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him. Neither Moto nor Moteah said anything, and so they journeyed on.
The rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. In places, the walls were so narrow that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways. Obo had to walk, which for him meant swiveling along on his stubs. Next came a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill. He started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself. The torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable—hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows that looked like shallow divots gave way to potholes that twisted his ankle. But the longer it went on the less and less he cared about these scrapes and bruises, because the ways were much more up-and-down than anything in the desert, or even the Goree Pass, and an unremitting burn set into his thighs.
They rested for a while underneath a hang of rock. Moto set up a house of twigs, set them alight, and when these twigs burned to ash they moved on again. They walked for another long while, became sore again, rested again, and at this point no one could agree on whether it was night or day above.
The God’s Eye sight came to Mandri on the third march. First came that familiar flash of white. His vision was flooded with a cosmic swirl of shimmering brightness, and when Mandri shucked his mind free of this blinding vision, he could see everyone’s Sparks stirring in their stomachs. Obo’s gold Spark outshone them all, but bright as he was, bright as they all were, they illuminated nothing. The dark dominion was oppressive, nothing like the Sand above, where even the rocks were coated with fibrous purpose. Down here the rocks were dead, and the only threads of purpose he could see were those which connected their Sparks, as well as those few threads which stretched out of their Sparks and into the tunnel ahead, drawing out the paths which they would walk.
Mandri followed his own thread of purpose and traced its movement with his stomach-dwelling Spark.
It was strange, seeing the future.
Following it was even stranger—did he follow it because he could see it and wanted to know where it went? Or did he follow it because it drew him along like some sort of puppet. The others were puppeted along, no doubt, as they couldn’t see what he saw. They couldn’t see the threads, and so they couldn’t see the choice, much less make one.
Then they came to a fork in the tunnel. All threads of purpose chose to wander right. Moto and Moteah argued about which way to go. Mandri stayed silent. Obo claimed he could hear faint echoes coming from the right, and so they chose to head right.
But Mandri knew that turning right was not a choice. The noise that Obo heard had a cause, and that cause was also caused, and so causes carry on in an infinite regress which could only end in the hand of Solraheen weaving a desired future. Mandri truly believed that this thread he followed was put there by Solraheen, and it was this great faith that comPeled him to see it through.
Soon, the way spilled out into a short, brickworked hall, and his shoes slapped onto flat stone tile. This hall then opened up into a cavern whose size was difficult to estimate. It was large enough to hide the echoes of their shuffling feet, so it must have been larger than Shulgi’s throne room. And the entirety of this cavern floor was paved in tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps or so, the floor’s simple square pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. 
This black sun was an unfamiliar design, like a flower with its petals closed and all points pointing inwards. In some sense, it was the opposite of the eightfold Jandri sun. Mandri took it to be a sign of Schisol, and he did not stop to study any of them. He hunched along as if sneaking. He almost laughed at the sight of Moto and Moteah skulking along behind, because if any demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they’d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches.
But there were no demons. In all the blackness around them, there were no demons or demon Sparks. And there weren’t any threads of purpose sPeling out their doom. There was only that faint swirl of guiding purpose floating in front of them and disappearing into the dark. 
They walked through this cavern for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern’s end. The purpose ended here—they could go no further. The stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a monstrous stone double-door that would require a team of oxen to open. These doors seemed sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures mostly, snarling demons doing unmentionable things to men and women unfleshed.
Set atop these doors was a stone head, bald like Obo’s, and twice as unnerving because it seemed to be licking its lips at sight of Mandri’s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders. The rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly limbs stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door’s bottom hinges.
Moteah eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn. “What do we do now?”
Mandri was dismayed to see his thread of purpose knot up at the base of the door. “I don’t know,” he said. “I think I just stand here and…”
“Knock?” said Moto.
Mandri reached out to knock, but there wasn’t a clean spot for it. The door’s panel was too full of sculpted, snarling demons. In the end he made no decision, as a thread of purpose alighted out of nothing to guide his knuckles toward the forehead of an anguished man who was being yanked along by hooks set into his skin.
The sound of Mandri’s knock was soft and barely there, two quick raps.
He took a step back, and waited.
He did not wait long, for out of the air around him there arose a voice, a woman’s voice, a voice as old and aggrieved as Elrahet’s.
“Come in,” it said, and it was followed by the sound of stone grinding against stone as these great doors of Shis swiveled in their hinges. They swiveled inward, and the doors’ two halves split to reveal a split of black. Tucked inside this darkness was a golden Spark.
The Spark floated forth and the torchlight revealed its figure—an old woman, tall and graceful, robed in a single black satin sheet that draped down to the floor but did not touch. Mandri recognized her long nose and imperious glare instantly—it was Pel.
It was the demon-witch who’d killed is ox back on his farm in Meskalim. The witch who’d set this all into motion, if causes could begin with her. Foul causes surely did. Not Solraheen’s hand, but Schisol’s.
Moto and Moteah drew their swords.
Pel drew a thin lipped smile.
“Oh, please,” she said to them, “Where are your manners?”
Obo, confident in his litter, said to the siblings, “Put your swords away.”
They both hesitated, but when Moteah sheathed her sword, so did Moto.
“Thank you,” said Pel. “And thank you,” she said as she cast an adoring eye upon Mandri. “You don’t know how long I’ve been trying to end Elrahet, and you managed it perfectly.”
Mandri could not speak. He was entranced by the sight of Pel’s Spark. It was gold, like Elrahet’s, like Obo’s, though it was completely devoid of purpose. Not a single thread in all the world was attached to it.
“Tongue tied?” Pel asked as she glided effortlessly towards him. “Do I frighten you? Speak, Mandrameen. This is your moment.” 
Moto was the one to seize it. “Mazid, Kill her!”
Obo climbed out of his litter and he sat on Mandri’s shoulder like an overgrown cat. He rested his elbow on Mandri’s head and said to Pel, “I’ve heard stories about you.”
“Such irony. A creature spends its short life searching for freedom, and found it by enslaving a Spark.”
“As may be,” said Obo. “But they say that you are my enemy, that you are a great evil, and that I should kill you.”
Pel stood there silently. She was either unwilling or unable to respond. Her face betrayed nothing, set as it was in a stony glare.
Obo said, “Have you nothing to say in your defense?”
Pel curled her lip. “Nothing I say will change what you will do. You will all do what you will.”
“That is a curious turn of phrase,” said Obo. “But, help me understand, was it you who corrupted the old king Greskal and brought forth the Amalgamete?”
“None but the Amalgamete can bring forth the Amalgamete.”
Moto was sweating rain despite the cavern’s chill. He shouted, “Why are you talking to her? Kill her!”
Pel rolled her eyes at the outburst. “Don’t fret, child, I am not the one who condemned you. That was Solraheen, your benevolent, loving, murderous god.”
“She’s Schisol’s shadow—kill her!”
“I am Schisol’s shadow, yes, and proud of it! Know that Solraheen is false and he does not love you. Know that Solraheen never called down that rock of Fabled Black to kill Himself and save the world. Know that this was done by Schisol, know that He sacrificed himself for your sakes, that Solraheen could no longer torture your Sparks.”
“Do you have any proof of your claims?” Obo asked. “Or do witchy women only speak in stories?”
“The proof is the peace that is soon to come. A peace which you will find in the belly of the Amalgamete.”
“I’ve killed your Amalgamete.”
Pel deflected this triumph away with a twitch of her sharp chin. “Another will come. In fact, he stands now on my doorstep.”
Her eyes settled on Mandri and an excited smile played on her lips.
“Mandri?” Obo asked, confused.
“Me?” Mandri echoed.
“You,” Pel said staunchly. “Why else would you be here before me now?”
Mandri’s dignity and vanity welled up his chest, for in no possible world would he assent to eating flesh or looking as foul as that putrid king. He raised his voice and declared, “I’m here because you killed my ox. I’m here because you—”
“Oh, please,” Pel moaned. “Do not bother me with trifles. Know that your grievances are Mandrameen’s, and that Mandrameen is an illusion. Mandrameen was born and he will die, but your real being knows neither beginning nor end. Come with me into Shis, I can show you what I mean. You can bring your friends along.”
It was then that Mandri noticed a new thread of purpose manifesting itself into being. It was drawn from his Spark and it led through Pel’s hip and disappeared behind her, through the doors of Shis.
Mandri took a step back.
“No,” he said firmly. “I’m not going anywhere with you.”
“Why else would you be here?” she asked, and her jagged lips eased into a beatific smile. “Mandrameen, the portrait painter. You’ve painted a thousand faces, but never your own. You may have painted a self-portrait, but know that a true self-portrait is impossible. A mirror hardly helps—you can never capture that look of looking away. And worse, your eyes always see straight into themselves. You are always alert. You are always alive. You are always there. But you have never seen yourself sleeping. You will never see what you look like when you’re dead. Everyone else’s eyes close and will close forever, but you’re own…who’s to say it’s not the world that disappears every time you blink?”
“She’s mad,” Moteah mumbled.
Mandri agreed, but more off-putting than this witch’s rambling was the realization that he hadn’t blinked since the doors of Shis had opened. Maybe it had been longer, maybe not since the God’s Eye burgeon took hold of him. And more than this, Pel had locked her gaze with his, and for a shuttered instant, her true eyes flashed, glowing gold, declaring mystic tidings which Mandri could not comprehend but he could feel—bright, and warm, and thankful.
Then she blinked and her eyes went dark again.
“Do you sleep, Mandrameen? Do you sleep? What happens to Mandrameen when you sleep? Where does he go?”
“I… I’ve never thought about it.”
“Good,” she said. “You’re honest. That’s more than I can say for those who seek an end to their suffering.”
“Kill her already!” Moto pleaded.
Pel seemed pleased to hear Moto’s voice crack.
“Look at this man,” she said as she flicked her beady eyes over the strong-backed Zosan. “See how frightened he is of dying. What does he fear? All he’ll lose are his illusions. Merge his Spark with yours and he shall know peace.”
“Aren’t you forgetting about me?” Obo asked as he readjusted himself atop Mandri’s shoulder. He was peeved to not be the center of attention, and he grunted when Pel ignored him. She stepped aside to clear a path towards the open doors behind her, and she held out an entreating arm towards Mandri, and with the back of her hand, she brushed the thread of purpose which led into the void. “Come young Mandrameen. Do not worry about the darkness, your eyes will adjust.”
Mandri stood dumbstruck at the sight of that thread of purpose leading him astray, and he gasped when he realized that he’d taken a single step forward.
As quickly as he could manage, he pulled Elrahet’s golden knife from out of his robe, and he slashed that bright white cord in two.
The thread of purpose burst into a spark-sprinkled mist, and Pel’s smirk shattered into a wrinkling frown.
“Whose purpose do you think you’ve cut!?” she snipped.
Moto and Moteah traded confused looks, unaware of what just happened, and for the first time ever, Obo’s hairless brow scrunched up like paper. “What is she talking about?” he asked.
Pel’s frown curdled into a withering scowl as she replied, “I speak of purpose! Your purpose. Mandrameen’s. All the gods are dead, they no longer weave their purpose into our world. All purpose is yours.” She stared down her long nose at Mandri. “The thread you cut was your own. You put it there, no one else. Yet that frightened you. Why?”
“Because I don’t want to do what you want me to do.”
“Hah! Yes! We speak with Mandrameen! He sees through everyone’s manipulations except his own. Typical. Typical of you all. You slavers of Sparks. You sifters of Selves. Pool your purpose together, and still it will fade.” She turned her scouring stare to the darkness of the cavern, and she threw her voice out into it, saying, “Gentler Sparks….would you grace us with your presence?”
Her request fell into the black, and a moment later the black began stir. Mandri tried to rub the insanity out of his eyes, but yes, the black itself began to stir, and as it weaved and wound like liquid smoke it squelched out growls and shrieks. Bright points of light emerged within it like swallowed stars, and these stars mounded up and grew brighter into full grown Sparks. Then came the pinching laughter of demons—not just two, or three, or twenty demons, for that sky of Sparks was joined by a horde of torch reflecting eyes. Thousands of blinking eyes in a thousand different configurations, all hovering there in the dark—eyes set wide, bovine eyes, mousey eyes, saucer eyes of squid, eightfold sets of spider eyes swaying overhead. 
The first demon to reveal itself was a naked knuckle-walking monkey, vaguely human, with a mouthless face that was scrunched up towards the middle, as if its lips were stuffed up into its nose. Then another set of glowing eyes stepped forth into the light, revealing itself to be a goat headed demon with black Zosan skin and a chiseled physique, and it stood on ungulate legs complete with cloven hooves. This demon was joined by a circle of new grotesqueries, each leaping out, it seemed, from Mandri’s childhood dreams. Every manner of mashed-up anatomy between man, insect, and beast, and this circle of dread surrounded him and his companions, a circle broken only by Pel and the doors of Shis behind her.
“You see,” Pel said, “If you have come to offer yourselves to the slaughter, then I accept.”
Mandri was stuck in shock at the sight of so great an evil—rank upon rank of evil. Enough evil here to bring about the end of days.
“Hold on,” said Obo, unconcerned. “These demons here, they want to kill me?”
“Nothing so crude,” Pel replied. “They simply want to put your Spark back into its rightful place.”
One of the demons nearest Mandri, a tusked woman with the body of a boar snarled and hissed, spraying Mandri’s leg with its stinking spittle.
“She is hungry,” Pel said, amused.
“I’m afraid that this is all unacceptable.”
Obo’s repudiation jolted Pel into amazement. Her thin lips grew tight, her brows jumped, and then she burst into a tremendous fit of laughter, a cackle which was taken up by her demon horde and escalated into a roar.
“Oh, my, my!” she said. “Unacceptable?! My dear creature, we have collected an uncountable number of Sparks throughout the ages. Yours will be no different.”
“Of that uncountable number, how many belonged to Mazid?”
“We have collected the Sparks of gods. I assure you, yours will be no different.”
“Then it seems a peaceable conclusion to our disagreement is not possible.”
“It never was.”
“Very well,” said Obo, and he opened his mouth. His throat ran gold and fire poured out in a beam as bright as the sun, smashing through the air where Pel had been—had been. The old witch expected this turn, and she’d flown away in a blur before Obo’s fire could singe her. Instead, his burst of blazing flame smashed into the doors of Shis.
“Huh,” Obo sputtered. “She’s fast for an old bat.”
Then Pel’s voice screamed out from the void above, “FEAST!”
That word was, as far as witchy pronouncements go, frighteningly unambiguous. It set the sea of demons to chattering—teeth chatter, giggle chatter, yapping-sucking-squealing chatter, and to Mandri’s horror, he saw threads of guiding purpose spool out of these demon’s Sparks and latch onto his own, and onto Obo’s, and onto Moto’s and and Moteah’s. There were so many demons and so many threads that the purpose was thick as a blanket, a circular blanket that split when a black, goat-headed demon took a step forward from the demon’s circle. Next to it was a fish-headed bear giant, and they both loomed large and snarled.
“Relax,” said Obo without a hint of worry, “We can all survive this. If you keep low and—”
The hunting shriek of a demon screeched out as the beast swooped down upon them. This demon was truly frightening—bat-winged and the size of a child, with a child’s flat face and enormous funnel ears that wrapped around its goofy head to frame its pea-sized eyes. It reached down with its feet and splayed its finger-talons wide, and just as it made to shriek again, its whole head was wooshed away by a roaring burst of Mazidfire.
The flame was so hot that it heated the demon’s chest into incandescence. The headless body burst into flames and hurtled overhead like a meteor before crashing into the crowd of demons behind. 
As the first blow struck, all Shis broke loose.
Demons came running, hopping, sliding, striding, galloping towards Mandri and the others. Scales sparkled and muscles bulged, whiskered snouts snapped and fanged maws hissed, pointed beaks screamed for oblivion—but Obo’s golden fire screamed back. He swung his coruscating flame in two great sweeping arcs, and he cut down a circle around Mandri, Moto, and Moteah, obliterating the first rank of evil, cutting the confidence out of that goat-headed demon at the waist. Those that scurried underneath Obo’s sweeping flame—the dog, hog, and lizard demons, the beetle demons—these Obo dispatched with incredible precision and blinding speed as more than twenty beams of fire flared out of his mouth in space of a breath, vaporizing the head of each demented creature on contact. Every smoking corpse burst into flame, leaving a ring of sizzling flesh to serve as stumbling blocks to the rest of the onrushing horde. 
Moto and Moteah gathered close to Mandri, close to Obo, who danced atop Mandri’s shoulder and dealt death to this demon horde. His fire spiraled round and round, and at each turn his flame traveled further out, mowing down larger and larger swathes of evil. In the wake of his golden beam was a smattering of distant explosions as those who fell combusted. 
But the demons were undeterred by the slaughter. On they came. It was not bravery, it was dumb, single-minded evil which drove them to consume all Sparks. And on and on they came. Thousands. Obo blasted birds and bats and all manner of giant insects out of the sky. But more flew and climbed out from unseen holes in the faraway ceiling. Their rippling backs glinted against the flash of Mazidfire, and it seemed the very skin of the cavern rock was writhing, for the swarm of Shis poured forth to protect their nest.
Each of them were tethered by shimmering threads to Mandri’s Spark, yet Obo’s fire spiraled through them all, and one by one these threads burst into mist as their sources were snuffed out. Amongst the roar of fire and agony, Mandri was pricked by the thought that Obo might be a god, a new god for a new age, a god who could conquer malignant purpose. And this little god stood supreme on Mandri’s shoulders, and Mandri could not contain himself as he whooped his excitement. Obo—disgraceful, graceful, pitiful, glorious Obo—was turning away the army of Shis all by himself.
Mandri’s eyes welled up with tears, as being so close to such awesome power was overwhelming. He also cried from the pain as Obo pulled sharply on his hair to keep from falling. But mostly the tears were due to honest awe and fascination. Obo’s pale skin glowed hot as the golden fire poured out of him, and for Mandri, that heat was the sun. He basked in its radiance. He craned his neck to view his savior’s face, and he marveled at the quickness of Obo’s eyes, darting from evil to evil, scouring them with his light.
Then something in Obo’s neck snapped, a muscle or tendon, and Obo’s silver eyes rolled back in their sockets as his flame continued to ruin the dark. His head tilted backwards, undirected, and a worrisome bulge extruded out the side of his white-hot neck until it burst.
Mandri screamed in horror as a gout of golden fire fountained out of that hole in Obo’s throat. Its heat was terrifying, and the force of its surge split the rest of Obo’s neck wide open. Then came a final, sputtering flash of gold, and Obo’s head peeled all the way back onto his shoulders. His fingers lost their grip on Mandri’s hair, and he fell off his perch.
Mandri twisted round and caught the falling Mazid.
“What happened!?” Moteah cried as she scanned the black sky above for some renewed assault which Obo might have missed, but there was only a rain of streaming flames as dead demons fell to the ground.
“Is it dead?” Moto asked as he propped Obo’s head up, hoping the front of Obo’s neck might reattach. But Obo’s eyes did not list from their split-eyed gaze, and his body was fully limp.
Obo had cleared a wide, flaming circle around them, a lake of combusted corpses, but Obo had not killed them all. A thousand threads of murderous purpose stretched through the flames and latched on to Obo’s golden Spark
Mandri wrenched up in rage.
“NO!”
He grabbed hold of his golden knife, and he slashed at those strangling threads as he’d seen Elrahet do. His wild flailing nearly slashed Moto’s hand, but he didn’t care, he slashed out again, and again, and again, and with each slicing stroke, bundles of these puppetry strings fell away and grew right back, rejoining themselves to Obo’s Spark.
“They come!” Moteah wailed, and her frightened cry was chased by a bout of cackling laughter as Pel spied their despair from the dark above. She swooped down, and her black robe billowed like smoke as she alighted upon the back of a smoldering toad-man demon whose long tongue rolled out on the floor. The sight of her beaming smile filled Mandri with rage.
In her hand was her golden blade, and her golden Spark was free from the net of purpose which enmeshed everything else. But Mandri did not need to see a bright white thread to know her purpose, for she licked her long teeth at the sight of Obo’s Spark.
That would not do.
Mandri took his golden knife and sliced open a gash right down Obo’s chest, all the way down to the belly. He reached in and pulled at the ribs, which easily unbuckled from the gleaming white sternum. It opened like the wing of a bird cage, and when Mandri saw his own severed hand laying there in the goop, he almost burst into tears, for that hand was the only part of him that had done anyone any good. There it lay, unused.
“Halt!” Pel shouted. The horde of demons halted by her side. The command was also meant for Mandri, and an anxious quiver split Pel’s lips. “Put down the knife,” she said. “You know not what you wield.”
Mandri gripped the knife more tightly. He looked down at Obo’s spherical stomach which listed in the oozing, smoking mess that was Obo’s insides. And there was Obo’s golden Spark. Mandri did not know what to do with it. He only knew that he didn’t want Pel to have it. More than anything he’d ever wanted, he wanted to stop that old witch from swallowing this blessed Spark. 
He reached down with his blade and nicked the stomach’s wet curve. An amber juice spilled out and mixed in with the rest of Obo’s muck.
And the Spark was there, bright as ever. A glorious sliver of its golden light peeped through the hole in the membrane and muscle.
Mandri hesitated.
He looked for a thread of purpose connecting him to it. Was he supposed to do it? Could he choose?
He saw nothing but the threads of others. Nothing connecting him.
Then Pel let loose a wild scream and took flight. She shot straight for him, and the shock of her gnashing teeth nearly cowed Mandri like it had done back on his farm in Meskalim.
He bent and sipped that liquid Spark into his mouth, then swallowed.
The Spark slimed down his throat.
Pel, flying furious, dodged Moto and Moteah’s swinging swords for their savage arcs were betrayed by arcs of preceding purpose. And just before her gnashing teeth smacked into Mandri’s chest, Obo’s golden Spark merged with Mandri’s own.
At once he was struck by both the witch and an all encompassing bliss. His body crashed to the floor while his mind was lost in senseless joy. Nothing mattered. This wasn’t despair, this was liberation. He was at the bottom of being, and down there was a warmth there that he could dwell. There was a presence there. He was being hugged. Somehow, Obo was with him, as was Elrahet, and that gnawing loneliness which plagued him since he came wailing out of his mother’s womb was gone, gone as if it were never there.
He was brought back to reality by Pel’s haunting laughter.
He lay on the ground, and she was kneeling over him. The brightness of her Spark was dazzling. The brightness of his own Spark glinted in her eyes, but she did not move to feast. And in the depths of Mandri’s bliss, her smile took on new meaning. Instead of delighting in his fear, she seemed satisfied, as if his swallowing of the Spark were a job well done.
“Beautiful,” she muttered as she marveled at Mandri’s joy. And more than admiration, the look in her eyes was one of longing. She locked her gaze with his, and Mandri could feel the emotion pouring out of her as vividly as if she were his mother, a lover, a dearest friend, a most hated enemy. All their history felt tied together, and this was a final parting.
“You see, don’t you, that there is a being greater than yourself.”
She then raised her knife in the air and brought it down upon her own belly. She ripped the gash wide with a pained jerk. Blood poured over her fingers, and with her free hand, she reached in, grabbed her stomach, and yanked out of her belly.
Her stomach’s mouth had been severed, but the attached intestines trailed along like a horrible, squelching, worm. she lowered her stomach’s open lip to Mandri’s awestruck mouth.
“Savor the taste,” she wheezed as she tipped her stomach like a wine bag.
Her Spark spilled out and it forced its way into Mandri’s throat. Reality twanged as Schisol’s gift merged with Solraheen’s—twinned divinities combined into one.
Mandri felt he might explode.
His flesh was not built to house this power.
He coughed.
His stomach wretched.
Pel’s bony hands fell upon his mouth and forced his jaw shut. With each new breath, her strength dwindled, and as the seed of divinity took root in a stomach fold, she fell back. The smack of her shoulders against the ground forced out the sigh of long ages.
With her death, the net of purpose which bound the horde of demons snapped. Their snarling, spitting, chatter went silent, and they all stood dumb as cattle. Moto and Moteah huddled together, dumbfounded by all they had just witnessed. The nearest demon, a bubble-backed ox with a single fang, stood dumb. Out of its pink spark came a wiggling thread of purpose. It latched onto the nearest Spark, a sand cat demon with human limbs.
The Ox turned its great heat towards the cat.
Slobber dripped down its jowl, and it let loose a bovine bleat.
The whole cavern erupted into chaos as the demonic horde fell upon itself. Snake and fowl chased each other. Lizard-man squared off against lizard-woman. Fangs and fingernails ripped at every manner of stomach, and if any demon stopped to eat, its own flesh was torn.
Mandri jumped up with such vigor as he had never felt. He grabbed Pel’s golden knife out of her stomach, and he ran towards the huddled siblings. Their Sparks shone bright. They were almost all he could see. Moteah’s face was a blur. Moto’s voice seemed disembodied.
“We need to get out of here!” Moto screamed as a bat-man demon flew low, chasing a giant fly with the head of a purse-lipped fish.
Mandri handed Pel’s golden knife out to the blur that was Moto.
“Swing it in the air,” he said.
“What?”
Mandri lashed out with his own golden knife and cut a thread of insatiable purpose as it wandered towards Moto’s hip.
“Just start swinging and follow me!”
He raced away. The siblings followed, and he charted a certain path through the ravenous, self-defeating horde. He hopped over flailing tail and limb, and he slid under a giant man-stork’s strides. He paused every now then to make sure that threads which snuck by Moto’s flailing knife were cut away. 
They ran and ran, and all the while, Mandri was losing his sense of bliss. Fear crept in between heavy breaths—not fear of demons, he could avoid them easily. Fear of something else. Something much deeper. Something that he’d swallowed.</Text>

        <Title>Before Ixnay Obo</Title>
        <Text>Mandri did not have to look long for an unnatural hole which might lead down to Shis, as there was one in the cluttered study that lay adjacent to the throne room.
The king’s study.
Greskal’s study.
The man must have found some dark grimoire that lured him to seek succor in Shis. Or so Mandri supposed. Finding that book would be difficult, as it seemed every book in the room had its spine cut and its innards loosed, and sheets of paper were scattered about like moon moths. Some were stuck to the walls. Some alighted on the large upturned table that lay canted on the far side of the room, its legs sticking up like a bloated cow. Some paper fluttered on the rim of a shield-sized hole in the center of the floor. A green carpet hung down into that hole’s depths, a carpet ripped to rags by a track of claw marks. Ascending claw marks, judging from the direction of the rip.
Moto dropped his torch down into this hole, revealing a red rock floor some few meters away.
“This should be fun,” said Obo. Mandri agreed. He felt invincible with Obo staring over his shoulder, though he was a tad worried that if a snarling demon dripped down out of the black, Obo’s purging flame might singe his cheek.
Mandri paused to take a quick sip of his God’s Eye burgeon, for the God’s Eye sight had faded. Obo had preternatural senses, and he wanted them too, especially now that he’d be taking the lead. When he’d stowed that burgeon away nice and safe inside his robe, he jumped down into that hole and picked up Moto’s torch.
At first there was a single tunnel, and its walls were fixed in brick and reinforced with wooden beams, but these constructions soon gave way to a meandering maze of natural stone which felt as old as the world itself. Mandri led, torch in hand, then Moteah followed, with Moto following close behind. The air was alive with the sounds of footfalls and heavy breathing—some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight, no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons waiting for a chance to strike. After some tracking and backtracking through this maze, Mandri turned a tight corner and came upon a doorless stone arch of ordinary size. This arch’s posts were perfectly plumb and square, and unfamiliar symbols were etched into them.
Mandri hesitated.
“Cold feet?” Moteah asked behind him. 
Mandri’s feet were cold, but that had nothing to do with it. He waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock and asked of anyone, “Can you read this?”
“It’s Schisol’s creed,” Obo said.
Every good Jandri child knows the words to Schisol’s creed. It is a creed which has floated through the Old Jandri world since forever. Solitants address it in mocking tones to rob the words of their power. In Hrkan law, whenever the creed is written in text, each line must be accompanied by a marginal note that explains the utter foolishness of it.

Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth.	(Premise assumes conclusion)
Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right. 	(Ambiguous terms.)
Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.	(Demonstrably wrong.)
Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be together.	(Pseudoprofundity)

That final, ominous line has spurred many a suicide pact, despite demystification. Such events are the work of demons, Solitants say. Demons put it in people’s heads that they’ll be less lonely in Shis if they bring other people down with them. It explains murder-suicides too. It’s all the influence of demons. And here Mandri was, heading down to Shis, being followed.
“We should keep moving,” Moteah said as she nudged Obo’s litter.
Mandri could not take his sight from the threshold. The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of symbols. He dared to reach out and touch them, and he found the grooves to be free of dust. All of it was remarkably clean.
Obo’s reassuring voice popped into his ear. “Whatever’s down here, I’ll handle it.” He then gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder, and confidence returned to Mandri’s legs. He stepped through the gate.
What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone arch made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs, and that was barely enough to allow descent. This path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. As Mandri had only one hand, he gave his torch to Obo to hold. And again his confidence fled—Obo might be able to save him from demons, but he couldn’t chase away a void such as this. 
When he’d shimmied halfway across, he slipped on a loose shard of rock that went tumbling into the void. He was able to regain his balance fairly easily, but he didn’t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the void, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up from below. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him. Neither Moto nor Moteah said anything, and so they journeyed on.
The rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. In places, the walls were so narrow that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways. Obo had to walk, which for him meant swiveling along on his stubs. Next came a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill. He started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself. The torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable—hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows that looked like shallow divots gave way to potholes that twisted his ankle. But the longer it went on the less and less he cared about these scrapes and bruises, because the ways were much more up-and-down than anything in the desert, or even the Goree Pass, and an unremitting burn set into his thighs.
They rested for a while underneath a hang of rock. Moto set up a house of twigs, set them alight, and when these twigs burned to ash they moved on again. They walked for another long while, became sore again, rested again, and at this point no one could agree on whether it was night or day above.
The God’s Eye sight came to Mandri on the third march. First came that familiar flash of white. His vision was flooded with a cosmic swirl of shimmering brightness, and when Mandri shucked his mind free of this blinding vision, he could see everyone’s Sparks stirring in their stomachs. Obo’s gold Spark outshone them all, but bright as he was, bright as they all were, they illuminated nothing. The dark dominion was oppressive, nothing like the Sand above, where even the rocks were coated with fibrous purpose. Down here the rocks were dead, and the only threads of purpose he could see were those which connected their Sparks, as well as those few threads which stretched out of their Sparks and into the tunnel ahead, drawing out the paths which they would walk.
Mandri followed his own thread of purpose and traced its movement with his stomach-dwelling Spark.
It was strange, seeing the future.
Following it was even stranger—did he follow it because he could see it and wanted to know where it went? Or did he follow it because it drew him along like some sort of puppet. The others were puppeted along, no doubt, as they couldn’t see what he saw. They couldn’t see the threads, and so they couldn’t see the choice, much less make one.
Then they came to a fork in the tunnel. All threads of purpose chose to wander right. Moto and Moteah argued about which way to go. Mandri stayed silent. Obo claimed he could hear faint echoes coming from the right, and so they chose to head right.
But Mandri knew that turning right was not a choice. The noise that Obo heard had a cause, and that cause was also caused, and so causes carry on in an infinite regress which could only end in the hand of Solraheen weaving a desired future. Mandri truly believed that this thread he followed was put there by Solraheen, and it was this great faith that compelled him to see it through.
Soon, the way spilled out into a short, brickworked hall, and his shoes slapped onto flat stone tile. This hall then opened up into a cavern whose size was difficult to estimate. It was large enough to hide the echoes of their shuffling feet, so it must have been larger than Shulgi’s throne room. And the entirety of this cavern floor was paved in tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps or so, the floor’s simple square pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. 
This black sun was an unfamiliar design, like a flower with its petals closed and all points pointing inwards. In some sense, it was the opposite of the eightfold Jandri sun. Mandri took it to be a sign of Schisol, and he did not stop to study any of them. He hunched along as if sneaking. He almost laughed at the sight of Moto and Moteah skulking along behind, because if any demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they’d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches.
But there were no demons. In all the blackness around them, there were no demons or demon Sparks. And there weren’t any threads of purpose spelling out their doom. There was only that faint swirl of guiding purpose floating in front of them and disappearing into the dark. 
They walked through this cavern for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern’s end. The purpose ended here—they could go no further. The stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a monstrous stone double-door that would require a team of oxen to open. These doors seemed sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures mostly, snarling demons doing unmentionable things to men and women unfleshed.
Set atop these doors was a stone head, bald like Obo’s, and twice as unnerving because it seemed to be licking its lips at sight of Mandri’s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders. The rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly limbs stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door’s bottom hinges.
Moteah eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn. “What do we do now?”
Mandri was dismayed to see his thread of purpose knot up at the base of the door. “I don’t know,” he said. “I think I just stand here and…”
“Knock?” said Moto.
Mandri reached out to knock, but there wasn’t a clean spot for it. The door’s panel was too full of sculpted, snarling demons. In the end he made no decision, as a thread of purpose alighted out of nothing to guide his knuckles toward the forehead of an anguished man who was being yanked along by hooks set into his skin.
The sound of Mandri’s knock was soft and barely there, two quick raps.
He took a step back, and waited.
He did not wait long, for out of the air around him there arose a voice, a woman’s voice, a voice as old and aggrieved as Elrahet’s.
“Come in,” it said, and it was followed by the sound of stone grinding against stone as these great doors of Shis swiveled in their hinges. They swiveled inward, and the doors’ two halves split to reveal a split of black. Tucked inside this darkness was a golden Spark.
The Spark floated forth and the torchlight revealed its figure—an old woman, tall and graceful, robed in a single black satin sheet that draped down to the floor but did not touch. Mandri recognized her long nose and imperious glare instantly—it was Pel.
It was the demon-witch who’d killed his ox back on his farm in Meskalim. The witch who’d set this all into motion, if causes could begin with her. Foul causes surely did. Not Solraheen’s hand, but Schisol’s.
Moto and Moteah drew their swords.
Pel drew a thin lipped smile.
“Oh, please,” she said to them, “Where are your manners?”
Obo, confident in his litter, said to the siblings, “Put your swords away.”
They both hesitated, but when Moteah sheathed her sword, so did Moto.
“Thank you,” said Pel. “And thank you,” she said as she cast an adoring eye upon Mandri. “You don’t know how long I’ve been trying to end Elrahet, and you managed it perfectly.”
Mandri could not speak. He was entranced by the sight of Pel’s Spark. It was gold, like Elrahet’s, like Obo’s, though it was completely devoid of purpose. Not a single thread in all the world was attached to it.
“Tongue tied?” Pel asked as she glided effortlessly towards him. “Do I frighten you? Speak, Mandrameen. This is your moment.” 
Moto was the one to seize it. “Mazid, Kill her!”
Obo climbed out of his litter and he sat on Mandri’s shoulder like an overgrown cat. He rested his elbow on Mandri’s head and said to Pel, “I’ve heard stories about you.”
“Such irony. A creature spends its short life searching for freedom, and found it by enslaving a Spark.”
“As may be,” said Obo. “But they say that you are my enemy, that you are a great evil, and that I should kill you.”
Pel stood there silently. She was either unwilling or unable to respond. Her face betrayed nothing, set as it was in a stony glare.
Obo said, “Have you nothing to say in your defense?”
Pel curled her lip. “Nothing I say will change what you will do. You will all do what you will.”
“That is a curious turn of phrase,” said Obo. “But, help me understand, was it you who corrupted the old king Greskal and brought forth the Amalgamete?”
“None but the Amalgamete can bring forth the Amalgamete.”
Moto was sweating rain despite the cavern’s chill. He shouted, “Why are you talking to her? Kill her!”
Pel rolled her eyes at the outburst. “Don’t fret, child, I am not the one who condemned you. That was Solraheen, your benevolent, loving, murderous god.”
“She’s Schisol’s shadow—kill her!”
“I am Schisol’s shadow, yes, and proud of it! Know that Solraheen is false and He does not love you. Know that Solraheen never called down that rock of Fabled Black to kill Himself and save the world. Know that this was done by Schisol, know that He sacrificed himself for your sakes, that Solraheen could no longer torture your Sparks.”
“Do you have any proof of your claims?” Obo asked. “Or do witchy women only speak in stories?”
“The proof is the peace that is soon to come. A peace which you will find in the belly of the Amalgamete.”
“I’ve killed your Amalgamete.”
Pel deflected this triumph away with a twitch of her sharp chin. “Another will come. In fact, he stands now on my doorstep.”
Her eyes settled on Mandri and an excited smile played on her lips.
“Mandri?” Obo asked, confused.
“Me?” Mandri echoed.
“You,” Pel said staunchly. “Why else would you be here before me now?”
Mandri’s dignity and vanity welled up his chest, for in no possible world would he assent to eating flesh or looking as foul as that putrid king. He raised his voice and declared, “I’m here because you killed my ox. I’m here because you—”
“Oh, please,” Pel moaned. “Do not bother me with trifles. Know that your grievances are Mandrameen’s, and that Mandrameen is an illusion. Mandrameen was born and he will die, but your real being knows neither beginning nor end. Come with me into Shis, I can show you what I mean. You can bring your friends along.”
It was then that Mandri noticed a new thread of purpose manifesting itself into being. It was drawn from his Spark and it led through Pel’s hip and disappeared behind her, through the doors of Shis.
Mandri took a step back.
“No,” he said firmly. “I’m not going anywhere with you.”
“Why else would you be here?” she asked, and her jagged lips eased into a beatific smile. “Mandrameen, the portrait painter. You’ve painted a thousand faces, but never your own. You may have painted a self-portrait, but know that a true self-portrait is impossible. A mirror hardly helps—you can never capture that look of looking away. And worse, your eyes always see straight into themselves. You are always alert. You are always alive. You are always there. But you have never seen yourself sleeping. You will never see what you look like when you’re dead. Everyone else’s eyes close and will close forever, but you’re own…who’s to say it’s not the world that disappears every time you blink?”
“She’s mad,” Moteah mumbled.
Mandri agreed, but more off-putting than this witch’s rambling was the realization that he hadn’t blinked since the doors of Shis had opened. Maybe it had been longer, maybe not since the God’s Eye burgeon took hold of him. And more than this, Pel had locked her gaze with his, and for a shuttered instant, her true eyes flashed, glowing gold, declaring mystic tidings which Mandri could not comprehend but he could feel—bright, and warm, and thankful.
Then she blinked and her eyes went dark again.
“Do you sleep, Mandrameen? Do you sleep? What happens to Mandrameen when you sleep? Where does he go?”
“I… I’ve never thought about it.”
“Good,” she said. “You’re honest. That’s more than I can say for those who seek an end to their suffering.”
“Kill her already!” Moto pleaded.
Pel seemed pleased to hear Moto’s voice crack.
“Look at this man,” she said as she flicked her beady eyes over the strong-backed Zosan. “See how frightened he is of dying. What does he fear? All he’ll lose are his illusions. Merge his Spark with yours and he shall know peace.”
“Aren’t you forgetting about me?” Obo asked as he readjusted himself atop Mandri’s shoulder. Pel regarded him with an uninterested eye. “You can come along as well.” She then stepped aside to clear a path towards the open doors behind, and she held out an entreating arm towards Mandri. With the back of her hand, she brushed the thread of purpose which led into the void. “Come young Mandrameen. Do not worry about the darkness, your eyes will adjust.”
Mandri stood dumbstruck at the sight of that thread of purpose leading him astray, and he gasped when he realized that he’d taken a step forward.
As quickly as he could manage, he pulled Elrahet’s golden knife from out of his robe, and he slashed that bright white cord in two. The thread of purpose burst into a shimmering mist. Pel hissed and set her furious gaze on Mandri. “Whose purpose do you think you’ve cut?”
Moto and Moteah traded confused looks, unaware of what just happened, and for the first time ever, Obo’s hairless brow scrunched up like paper. “What is she talking about?” he asked.
Pel’s frown curdled into a withering scowl. “I speak of purpose!” she screeched. “Your purpose. Mandrameen’s. Whose purpose have you cut? All the gods are dead, they no longer weave their purpose into our world. All purpose here is yours.” She stared down her long nose at Mandri. “The thread you cut was your own. You put it there, no one else. That frightened you. Why?”
“Because I don’t want to do what you want me to do.”
“Hah! Yes! We speak with Mandrameen! He sees through everyone else’s manipulations except his own. Paints everyone’s picture except his own. Typical. Typical of you all. You slavers of Sparks. You sifters of Selves. Pool your purpose together, and still it will fade.” She turned her scouring stare to the darkness of the cavern, and she threw her voice out into it, saying, “Gentler Sparks….would you grace us with your presence?”
Her request fell into the black, and a moment later the black began stir. Mandri tried to rub the insanity out of his eyes, but yes, the black itself began to stir, and as it weaved and wound like liquid smoke it squelched out growls and shrieks. Bright points of light emerged within it like swallowed stars, and these stars mounded up and grew brighter into full grown Sparks. Then came the pinching laughter of demons—not just two, or three, or twenty demons, for that sky of Sparks was joined by a horde of torch reflecting eyes. Thousands of blinking eyes in a thousand different configurations, all hovering there in the dark—eyes set wide, bovine eyes, mousey eyes, saucer eyes of squid, eightfold sets of spider eyes swaying overhead. 
The first demon to reveal itself was a naked knuckle-walking monkey, vaguely human, with a mouthless face that was scrunched up towards the middle, as if its lips were stuffed up into its nose. Then another set of glowing eyes stepped forth into the light, revealing itself to be a goat headed demon with black Zosan skin and a chiseled physique, and it stood on ungulate legs complete with cloven hooves. This demon was joined by a circle of new grotesqueries, each leaping out, it seemed, from Mandri’s childhood dreams. Every manner of mashed-up anatomy between man, insect, and beast, and this circle of dread surrounded him and his companions, a circle broken only by Pel and the doors of Shis behind her.
“You see,” Pel said, “If you have come to offer yourselves to the slaughter, then I accept.”
Mandri was stuck in shock at the sight of so great an evil—rank upon rank of evil. Enough evil here to bring about the end of days.
“Hold on,” said Obo, unconcerned. “These demons here, they want to kill me?”
“Nothing so crude,” Pel replied. “They simply want to put your Spark back into its rightful place.”
One of the demons nearest Mandri, a tusked woman with the body of a boar snarled and hissed, spraying Mandri’s leg with its stinking spittle.
“She is hungry,” Pel said, amused.
“I’m afraid that this is all unacceptable.”
Obo’s repudiation jolted Pel into amazement. Her thin lips grew tight, her brows jumped, and then she burst into a tremendous fit of laughter, a cackle which was taken up by her demon horde and escalated into a roar.
“Oh, my, my!” she said. “Unacceptable?! My dear creature, we have collected an uncountable number of Sparks throughout the ages. Yours will be no different.”
“Of that uncountable number, how many belonged to Mazid?”
“We have collected the Sparks of gods. I assure you, yours will be no different.”
“Then it seems a peaceable conclusion to our disagreement is not possible.”
“It never was.”
“Very well,” said Obo, and he opened his mouth. His throat ran gold and fire poured out in a beam as bright as the sun, smashing through the air where Pel had been—had been. The old witch expected this turn, and she’d flown away in a blur before Obo’s fire could singe her. Instead, his burst of blazing flame smashed into the doors of Shis.
“Huh,” Obo sputtered. “She’s fast for an old bat.”
Then Pel’s voice screamed out from the void above, “FEAST!”
That word was, as far as witchy pronouncements go, frighteningly unambiguous. It set the sea of demons to chattering—teeth chatter, giggle chatter, yapping-sucking-squealing chatter, and to Mandri’s horror, he saw threads of guiding purpose spool out of these demon’s Sparks and latch onto his own, and onto Obo’s, and onto Moto’s and and Moteah’s. There were so many demons and so many threads that the purpose was thick as a blanket, a circular blanket that split when a black, goat-headed demon took a step forward from the demon’s circle. Next to it was a fish-headed bear giant, and they both loomed large and snarled.
“Relax,” said Obo without a hint of worry, “We can all survive this. If you keep low and—”
The hunting shriek of a demon screeched out as the beast swooped down upon them. This demon was truly frightening—bat-winged and the size of a child, with a child’s flat face and enormous funnel ears that wrapped around its goofy head to frame its pea-sized eyes. It reached down with its feet and splayed its finger-talons wide, and just as it made to shriek again, its whole head was wooshed away by a roaring burst of Mazidfire.
The flame was so hot that it heated the demon’s chest into incandescence. The headless body burst into flames and hurtled overhead like a meteor before crashing into the crowd of demons behind. 
As the first blow struck, all Shis broke loose.
Demons came running, hopping, sliding, striding, galloping towards Mandri and the others. Scales sparkled and muscles bulged, whiskered snouts snapped and fanged maws hissed, pointed beaks screamed for oblivion—but Obo’s golden fire screamed back. He swung his coruscating flame in two great sweeping arcs, and he cut down a circle around Mandri, Moto, and Moteah, obliterating the first rank of evil, cutting the confidence out of that goat-headed demon at the waist. Those that scurried underneath Obo’s sweeping flame—the dog, hog, and lizard demons, the beetle demons—these Obo dispatched with incredible precision and blinding speed as more than twenty beams of fire flared out of his mouth in space of a breath, vaporizing the head of each demented creature on contact. Every smoking corpse burst into flame, leaving a ring of sizzling flesh to serve as stumbling blocks to the rest of the onrushing horde. 
Moto and Moteah gathered close to Mandri, close to Obo, who danced atop Mandri’s shoulder and dealt death to this demon horde. His fire spiraled round and round, and at each turn his flame traveled further out, mowing down larger and larger swathes of evil. In the wake of his golden beam was a smattering of distant explosions as those who fell combusted. 
But the demons were undeterred by the slaughter. On they came. It was not bravery, it was dumb, single-minded evil which drove them to consume all Sparks. And on and on they came. Thousands. Obo blasted birds and bats and all manner of giant insects out of the sky. But more flew and climbed out from unseen holes in the faraway ceiling. Their rippling backs glinted against the flash of Mazidfire, and it seemed the very skin of the cavern rock was writhing, for the swarm of Shis poured forth to protect their nest.
Each of them were tethered by shimmering threads to Mandri’s Spark, yet Obo’s fire spiraled through them all, and one by one these threads burst into mist as their sources were snuffed out. Amongst the roar of fire and agony, Mandri was pricked by the thought that Obo might be a god, a new god for a new age, a god who could conquer malignant purpose. And this little god stood supreme on Mandri’s shoulders, and Mandri could not contain himself as he whooped his excitement. Obo—disgraceful, graceful, pitiful, glorious Obo—was turning away the army of Shis all by himself.
Mandri’s eyes welled up with tears, as being so close to such awesome power was overwhelming. He also cried from the pain as Obo pulled sharply on his hair to keep from falling. But mostly the tears were due to honest awe and fascination. Obo’s pale skin glowed hot as the golden fire poured out of him, and for Mandri, that heat was the sun. He basked in its radiance. He craned his neck to view his savior’s face, and he marveled at the quickness of Obo’s eyes, darting from evil to evil, scouring them with his light.
Then something in Obo’s neck snapped, a muscle or tendon, and Obo’s silver eyes rolled back in their sockets as his flame continued to ruin the dark. His head tilted backwards, undirected, and a worrisome bulge extruded out the side of his white-hot neck until it burst.
Mandri screamed in horror as a gout of golden fire fountained out of that hole in Obo’s throat. Its heat was terrifying, and the force of its surge split the rest of Obo’s neck wide open. Then came a final, sputtering flash of gold, and Obo’s head peeled all the way back onto his shoulders. His fingers lost their grip on Mandri’s hair, and he fell off his perch.
Mandri twisted round and caught the falling Mazid.
“What happened!?” Moteah cried as she scanned the black sky above for some renewed assault which Obo might have missed, but there was only a rain of streaming flames as dead demons fell to the ground.
“Is it dead?” Moto asked as he propped Obo’s head up, hoping the front of Obo’s neck might reattach. But Obo’s eyes did not list from their split-eyed gaze, and his body was fully limp.
Obo had cleared a wide, flaming circle around them, a lake of combusted corpses, but Obo had not killed them all. A thousand threads of murderous purpose stretched through the flames and latched on to Obo’s golden Spark
Mandri wrenched up in rage.
“NO!”
He grabbed hold of his golden knife, and he slashed at those strangling threads as he’d seen Elrahet do. His wild flailing nearly slashed Moto’s hand, but he didn’t care, he slashed out again, and again, and again, and with each slicing stroke, bundles of these puppetry strings fell away, but they grew right back, rejoining themselves to Obo’s Spark.
“They come!” Moteah wailed, and her frightened cry was chased by a bout of cackling laughter as Pel spied their despair from the dark above. She swooped down, and her black robe billowed like smoke. She alighted upon the back of a smoldering toad-man demon whose long tongue rolled out onto the floor. The sight of her beaming smile filled Mandri with rage.
In her hand was her golden blade, and her golden Spark was free from the net of purpose which enmeshed everything else. But Mandri did not need to see a bright white thread to know her purpose, for she licked her long teeth at the sight of Obo’s Spark.
That would not do.
Mandri took his golden knife and sliced open a gash right down Obo’s chest, all the way down to the belly. He reached in and pulled at the ribs, which easily unbuckled from the gleaming white sternum. It opened like the wing of a bird cage, and when Mandri saw his own severed hand laying there in the goop, he almost burst into tears, for that hand was the only part of him that had done anyone any good. There it lay, unused.
“Halt!” Pel shouted. The horde of demons halted by her side. The command was also meant for Mandri, and an anxious quiver split Pel’s lips. “Put down the knife,” she said. “You know not what you do.”
Mandri gripped the knife more tightly. He looked down at Obo’s spherical stomach which listed in the oozing, smoking mess that was Obo’s insides. And there was Obo’s golden Spark. Mandri did not know what to do with it. He only knew that he didn’t want Pel to have it. More than anything he’d ever wanted, he wanted to stop that old witch from swallowing this blessed Spark. 
He reached down with his blade and nicked the stomach’s wet curve. An amber juice spilled out and mixed in with the rest of Obo’s muck.
And the Spark was there, bright as ever. A glorious sliver of its golden light peeped through the hole in the membrane and muscle.
Mandri hesitated.
There was a thread of purpose connecting him to it.
“Yes!” Pell cackled. “Deny my will. Do what you want. Be young Mandrameen and swallow that Spark.”
An anxious moment passed as Mandri wondered what he should do. The many faces of evil surrounded him. Their number was dwarfed by the darkness. Mandri tried to find the thread which marked his future winding through them, but it was all too complex. In the end, it was the sight of Obo’s broken face which made his mind, and at that same instant, Pel let loose a wild scream and took flight. She shot straight for Mandri, and the shock of her gnashing teeth nearly cowed him.
Mandri bent and sipped that liquid Spark into his mouth, then swallowed.
The Spark slimed down his throat.
Pel, flying furious, dodged Moto and Moteah’s swinging swords for their savage arcs were betrayed by arcs of preceding purpose. And just before her gnashing teeth smacked into Mandri’s chest, Obo’s golden Spark merged with Mandri’s own.
At once he was struck by both the witch and an all encompassing bliss. His body crashed to the floor while his mind was lost in senseless joy. Nothing mattered. This wasn’t despair, this was liberation. He was at the bottom of being, and down there was a warmth there that he could dwell. There was a presence there. He was being hugged. Somehow, Obo was with him, as was Elrahet, and that gnawing loneliness which plagued him since he came wailing out of his mother’s womb was gone, gone as if it were never there.
He was brought back to reality by Pel’s haunting laughter.
He lay on the ground, and she was kneeling over him. The brightness of her Spark was dazzling. The brightness of his own Spark glinted in her eyes, but she did not move to feast. And in the depths of Mandri’s bliss, her smile took on new meaning. Instead of delighting in his fear, she seemed satisfied, as if his swallowing of the Spark were a job well done.
“Beautiful,” she muttered as she marveled at Mandri’s joy. And more than admiration, the look in her eyes was one of longing. She locked her gaze with his, and Mandri could feel the emotion pouring out of her as vividly as if she were his mother, a lover, a dearest friend, a most hated enemy. All their history felt tied together, and this was a final parting.
“You see, don’t you, that there is a being greater than yourself.”
She then raised her knife in the air and brought it down upon her own belly. She ripped the gash wide with a pained jerk. Blood poured over her fingers, and with her free hand, she reached in, grabbed her stomach, and pulled it out of her belly.
Her stomach’s mouth had been severed, but the intestines trailed along like a horrible, squelching, worm. She lowered her stomach’s open lip to Mandri’s awestruck mouth.
“Savor the taste,” she wheezed as she tipped her stomach like a wine bag.
Her Spark spilled out and it forced its way into Mandri’s throat. Reality twanged as Schisol’s gift merged with Solraheen’s—twinned divinities combined into one inside his body.
Mandri felt he might explode.
His flesh was not built to house this power.
He coughed.
His stomach spasmed.
Pel’s bony hands fell upon his mouth and forced his jaw shut. With each new breath, her strength dwindled, and as the seed of divinity took root in a stomach fold, she fell back. The smack of her shoulders against the ground forced out an eonic sigh.
With her death, the net of purpose which bound the horde of demons snapped. Their snarling, spitting, chatter went silent, and they all stood as dumb as cattle. Moto and Moteah huddled together against the weight of what they’d witnessed. The demon nearest to them, a bubble-backed ox with a single fang, mooed at them as if in recognition. Then out of that demon’s pink spark came a wiggling thread of purpose. It latched onto the wiggling tail of a sand cat demon with reticulated fur.
The Ox turned its great head towards the cat. Slobber dripped down its jowl. It let loose a bovine bleat, then charged. The cat yowled and reared, and as fast as a thunderclap the whole cavern erupted into chaos—the whole demonic horde fell upon itself. Snake and fowl chased each other. Lizard-man squared off against lizard-woman. Limbs and blood and bodies went flying through the air. Fangs and fingernails ripped at every manner of stomach, and if any demon stopped to eat, its own flesh was torn.
Mandri jumped up with such vigor as he had never felt. He grabbed Pel’s golden knife out of her stomach, and he ran towards the huddled siblings. Their Sparks shone bright. They were almost all he could see. Moteah’s face was a blur. Moto’s voice seemed disembodied.
“We need to get out of here!” Moto screamed as a bat-man demon flew low, chasing a giant fly with the head of a purse-lipped fish.
Mandri handed Pel’s golden knife out to the blur that was Moto.
“Swing it in the air,” he said.
“What?”
Mandri lashed out with his own golden knife and cut a thread of demonic purpose as it wandered towards Moto’s hip.
“Just start swinging and follow me!”
Mandri raced away. The siblings followed, and he charted a certain path through the ravenous, self-defeating horde. He hopped over flailing tail and claw, and he slid under a giant man-stork’s strides. He paused every now then to make sure that insatiable threads which snuck by Moto’s flailing knife were cut away. 
They ran and ran, and all the while, Mandri was losing his sense of bliss. Fear crept in between heavy breaths—not fear of demons, he could avoid them easily. Fear of something else. Something much deeper. Something that he’d swallowed.</Text>
