        <Title>Ending Q</Title>
        <Text>Ayram soon outpaced them all to take the lead, and as he did, Elrahet climbed up and over his monstrous pack and then climbed down the other side to sit atop his shoulders like a toddler. 
“Faster!” she cried as she twisted around to glare at all who lagged behind.
Mandri struggled. The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a canyon valley, but Ayram’s pace was furious, and the giant scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree, and to Mandri’s unworked arms and legs it might as well have been a  tallest mountain in the world. Moto had to push him up, and near the top, Moteah had to pull him.
From there, the jogged along a shelf of sturdy rock, and this way ran right aside the road below until it dead ended into wall of reddish stone, solid stone save for narrow crack which split it in two. This crack’s opening was hardly an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders, but somehow Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
 Mandri’s arms and legs bumped and scraped against this crack’s striated walls. If he wasn’t blushing with exhaustion and fear he might have savored the scene—layers of red and off-red rock stacked on top each other to compose dramatic sweeping forms that towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky. The sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he ran along, and such was the height and swerve of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mushy pile of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
 The way twisted and bent, right and left, and soon Mandri was so far behind that he rarely caught a glimpse of Moteah, much less anyone else beyond her. He was chasing the sounds of their paddling feet. Then he came to fork in the road, and didn’t know which way to take, as the Ayramun had charged ahead without sparing care for him.
Before he could get to worried, a packless, Elrahetless Ayram came sprinting back from the leftern way.
“Keep going!” Ayram growled as he charged towards Mandri. It seemed as if the giant was about to tackle him, but the man stuck his iron spear into the sand and vaulted right over Mandri’s head.
 The giant landed as soft as rain, and when he did he spared another glare for Mandri, and that set Mandri’s legs in motion again, he ran down the leftern way, wondering why Ayram was headed in the opposite direction. 
Mandri ran on and on without catching sight of anyone. Twice he asked Obo for confirmation that they were headed the right way, and Obo simply stated that there was only the one way to go. He also said to hurry up, for he could sense the Riga was warming its whistle.
Soon a whole hand had passed, measured out by the oppressive eye of the sun as it crossed the thin bridge of blue above. Mandri’s sprint slowed to a half-hearted, heavy-breathing jog, for he was weak and the air was heating up. Unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off Mandri’s skin the moment it beaded up. Few feelings are more uncomfortable than a soggy lower back being patted by Obo’s litter. The vortex of steamy air that emerged there in that gap was a weather system unto itself, and this self-sustaining convection current, shaped by the contours of muscle, leather, and spine, was only good for one thing—distracting him from thinking about demons.
But it only worked for so long. He marched at the quickest pace he could muster, and when this slowed to a walk he found himself searching the shadows for camouflaged demons that might leap out to get him.
He remembered the burgeon he’d stolen from Seb. If his eyes couldn’t see the demons that he felt must be there, then the God’s Eye sight might reveal them. He patted the burgeon bulb inside his robe to make sure it was still there, and as he weighed the pros and cons of risking his vision to its juice, the way belled out into a short stripe of rock-rubble valley, revealing the rest of the Ayramun.
It was a miniature valley of sorts, as it was only there because a great length of the rock on either side had collapsed. The valley’s belly was clogged up by a mound of rock, though enough of this mound had been cleared away to make a thin, passable trail. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope was the Goree’s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision, and above that, the latter-day sun blazed down. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were the Ayramun. They were arguing about something, and as Mandri approached he heard Moto say, “…and no backtalk. And that goes for you too, Seb. You been getting uppity these days and it’s time to stop.”
Seb soured at this sudden turn. “I don’t give lip. I give suggestions.”
“No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
Mandri joined their huddle and asked, “What’s going on?”
“I’m in charge,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram went to go do Ayram things.”
“Ayram things?”
“He’s going to bother the Hrks and distract the Riga. Maybe even kill it. What we got to do is divvy up Ayram’s stuff and keep going.”
Ayram’s great pack was lying there on the ground. The shadow it cast was almost as long as the shadow of the boulder Mandri was hiding in. He let loose an exhausted groan and said, “I can’t carry any of that.”
Moto stared Mandri square and said slowly, stressing the threat of punishment, “You’ll do what I tell you to do.”
Mandri shrank back and raised his hands to surrender.
Moteah laughed.
“You got something to say?” Moto asked to his sister.
“Come on,” said Moteah. “Look at him. He’s a twig, he can hardly carry himself.”
Moto’s jaw went tight. He stood up even straighter. His nose flared as he sniffed that elevated air of authority. He pointed a finger at Moteah and declared, “Then you will carry his share.”
Moteah scoffed and settled in for a fight. She put her hand-on-sidethrust-hip, and not to be outskilled in art of finger-wagging, she flicked her finger right back at Moto and said, “How about, for once, you take up the weight when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a slapback lizard unfurling it’s frills, he rolled his shoulders back to puff his chest. The siblings might have come to blows if a wad of borcandi juice didn’t go flying right between them.
“I’ll carry it,” Seb grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop bitchin’ and we can get on with it, I’ll carry the damn thing.”
“There’s no room in your pack,” said Moto.
“Sol’s sake, lash it to my spine then.”
Seb unshouldered her pack and dropped it at Moto’s feet. Moto, unhappy with Seb’s act of charity, kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he gathered some of Ayram’s gear and stuffed what he could into Seb’s pack.
Seb bore her new burden with the stolidity of an ox, and she charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though her springy step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the weight.
Elrahet followed after her, and after gathering some Ayram’s things, Moteah followed too, being sure to brush by her brother with a smirk.
Moto tossed a few blankets and the heavier ropes onto a nearby rock, as they weren’t needed, and when he got annoyed with Mandri watching, he pointed after the others and said, “Get going.”
Day progressed, the canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky dimmed into purpler hues. It was near the golden hour when their path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau.
There, Mandri was greeted with a sight which pushed out all concerns—Hrks, Rigas, Amalgametes, demonry, his own exhaustion—for there in front of him was an enormous structure, at once a building and a mountain, at once a flat-topped chunk of natural stone looming into the sky and a richly ornamented temple whose walls were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes—circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles—and these shapes were joined together to roughly resemble faces. There were animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval the size of two-floor building demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the nose of a snarling demon. It was patterns inside of patterns, lines inside of lines, and Mandri had to crane his neck to look up at it, for temple, named Shulgi according to Seb, was set on top of a sloping hill of rock rubble, rubble laid down by both the despoiling hands of time and humanity.
Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights Shulgi should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered serve well to heighten the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crowns, and that’s even after accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays painted the stone with flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they’d have a much easier time of it because the building was a hollow husk. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arches, each as empty of candlelight as the next. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a pretty lizard woman. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
Moto jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramless file. He guided them up the well-trodden slope to the foot of a long flight of stairs which led up to the temple entrance. These were troublesome stairs, and there were at least a hundred of them. They were steep, and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms for they each had their own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.
Three steps up and Mandri noticed a dark stain climbing up the stairs with him as he went. He guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be a number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement—a temple that large had to have drainage somewhere, though yes, it would be odd that they’d have it running out the front door. 
But he knew it was blood. 
Because of course it was blood.
There were demons about and there weren’t any people where people were expected to be.
It had to be blood. Blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under skin, it explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple’s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. Then his eyes alighted on the temple entrance, which itself had been sculpted in that curvilinear language into the head of a viper. It’s fangs were similarly stained by that dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the building itself had eaten the Greskalun. 
They crossed the pillared court at decent clip. Moto drew his sword as if to do battle with the building itself. He stopped before crossing the threshold. He peered inside, then drew away and said, “We’ll wait for Ayram somewhere else.”
Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion, “I’m not going back down,” she said. “I climbed up these steps and I’ll be damned if I don’t stick my head in and see what’s happened.”
“No,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram said that we should only wait inside if it was empty.”
“Someone get a torch going,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moteah was a step ahead of her, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks that Seb was holding. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.
Moto yanked the torch out of his sister’s hands.
“Ayram put me in charge,” he said.
Elrahet sneered. “Take charge of your wits and march yourself inside.”
Moto stewed in a wordless anger. He took a moment and a long-sipped breath to compose himself, and he thrust the torch into the temple interior. 
As soon he did, a swarm of bats screeched in the darkness and took flight. Their wingbeats battered the torch smoke as they swirled out of the viper’s mouth, and they swerved along the temple wall before disappearing into some unseen hole.
Moto had to start all over with his composure. When he was ready, he leaned into the temple entrance and sniffed the air. His face immediately soured.
“It smells horrible.”
Moteah agreed. “It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“I suppose you would know.”
“Get a move on,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone filtered in behind. Mandri looked over his shoulder to Obo before he entered. Obo simply nodded.
Shulgi’s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a barge, thrice as long, and at least twice Ayram’s height. The torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dugout into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that was filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had swept some of this ash around the room, with trails of it sprinkling the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing the Ayramun, was a man sitting cross-legged.
Moto halted his people with a loud, “Ip!”, and he waved his torch back and forth.
The man did not move.
Moto shouted, “Hello!”, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.
The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was his black, ash splattered hair.
“Probably dead,” marked Seb.
“Oh, you think so?” said Moto.
“You’re the one that said ‘hello’ to it.”
Elrahet held out her hand towards Moto and made a grasping motion, requesting the torch. Moto handed it over, and with it’s light leading the way, she hobbled towards the mysterious figure.
“He must’ve been eating mice,” said Moto as he kicked a small spine that was lying on the floor.
“Or bats,” said Seb.
Now that Mandri knew that bones were there, he was seeing them everywhere, the scattered remains of small creatures littered the floor—thin boned lizard legs, bats, perhaps foxes, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. 
Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that cross-legged figure and poked him hard with her can.
The man fell onto his side. His impact kicked up a cloud of ash.
“He is indeed dead,” Elrahet declared. “And he is a not a man, or not wholly a man, I should say. His stomach is changed.”
She bent down and rubbed the dead man’s robe in between her fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “This is the raiment of Greskal’s prince.”
Moteah then asked what Mandri was thinking, “Was he the Amalgamete?”
“An Amalgamete…The Amalgamete…almost…maybe…but it is dead.”
Elrahet’s presence so far into the room gave Mandri the courage to join her. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be ‘inside’—that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so many days wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were dead critters and a dead body? So what if there were demons lurking in the shadows? It felt good to flout these ominous things. If he didn’t, he’d probably faint.
As he crept towards the fire-pit, he noticed a faint golden glimmer in the back of the room. He walked Elrahet and the body, towards that glimmer, for shining faintly in the torch’s dancing light was an enormous golden statue of Solraheen sitting at the back of the hall.
As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a rare Old Jandri piece where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling—a form outlawed by Hrk, for it was sacrilegious to suggest that Solraheen’s principles did not dwell in Jeket. Here, His golden skin was smooth and His body featureless. His face was round, alive, and enlightened. His pose was rigid as a board, as if someone who had never sat before had the act described to them by blind man. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to reality. It was more primitive, and therefore, more true. And it was huge, at least ten feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.
It was a beautiful sight. A source of serenity. None of it glittered as brightly as Mandrameen might have wanted, for a thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash had speckled His cheek. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. But what could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen’s golden skin was darkly mottled. It was tarnished.
Mandri winced at such impiety. Pure gold cannot tarnish, and so this meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals. No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their suffering. And worse—standing by Solraheen’s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine.
Now, he could not say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which couldn’t be ignored. Surely—surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.
One indignity to wash away another.
“They should have settled for a smaller statue,” Mandri mumbled.
“What’s that?” croaked Elrahet.
Mandri pointed to the statue. “It’s tarnished,” he said.
“What of it?”
“It’s not pure gold.”
Elrahet cackled then said, “Solraheen cares not for gold. What He cares about is this man here,” she poked the dead man again with her cane, “And that poor thing there.” She pointed with the torch to a dark lump sitting not ten feet away from Mandri. 
Mandri yelped in fright, for the round lump lurking on the floor in the shadows had an ear.
It had a mop of dark hair.
It had a neck, and attached to this neck were a few links of spine. What flesh there was looked like it had been gnawed on.
Mandri scuffled back towards the others.
“You were right, Mazid,” said Elrahet. “Though it wasn’t hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.”
Moto was standing over the green robed body. He said, “Are you saying that this man ate that other man over there?” 
Elrahet nodded. “It was his final meal.”
“Ok, we’re leaving,” said Moto.
“No,” said Elrahet. “The struggle in this room is over.”
“We should burn it. That’s what we came here to do!”
Elrahet shook her head. “Don’t be so quick to judge those touched by the darkness, for there is no greater struggle. This was one of Solraheen’s champions. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it transformed him completely. See here—”
She held the torch low to the firepit, and she poked around it with her cane to reveal, half buried in ash, a large round stomach. Evidently this green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it the intestines behind, and these he’d cut as well and tossed into the ash. 
“If he had lost his battle, this world’s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand.”
The stomach was black, nearly as black as Fabled Black, and while that might be expected for flesh cooking in flames, it seemed to Mandri that it was black for other reasons.
Moteah asked, “Was he responsible for the pilgrim poles?”
“Perhaps,” said Elrahet. She then pulled out her golden knife and cut the stomach open without effort. She used her cane to spread the halves apart, and she leaned over it as if to divine it.
Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ is subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance—there’s the stomach’s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the meaning of current and past events but predict the future. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach, that he would understand anything about what was going on. But when that stomach peeled open, it let loose a black puff of smoke that struck Mandri dumb with dread.
It seemed the room itself shuddered and gasped.
“Oooookay,” said Moto. “We’re not waiting in here.”
Elrahet ignored him. She sorted through the stomach’s contents with her blade, and her face grew more sullen with every poke. 
“Did you not hear me?” Moto asked. “I said we’re leaving.”
“Don’t have to tell me twice,” said Seb, and she rushed back towards the entrance. No one else budged.
“Elrahet,” Moto pleaded, “Please just do what I ask you to do.”


Elrahet snapped and said, “Go look for Ayram.”
Moto’s shoulders sank. He looked despondently up at the ceiling and sank into misery for a spell. Then he clapped his hands, and said, “Alright. Alllllright. If a demon falls down from the ceiling and starts making your insides be outsides, don’t complain to me.”
  He threw his pack down, pulled from it a rock crystal spyglass and hurried out into the oncoming night to watch for Ayram’s coming.
Elrahet shouted after him like a worried, but angry mother.
“Don’t stray far!”
And like every son with his own ideas, Moto ignored her.
Mandri decided to follow Moto, because the divination of entrails was not for him. He set his Obo-stuffed pack against an ash-brushed column and hurried outside. 
The evening breeze was a revelation, it told of just how foul the air in that hall really was. Mandri took a deep breath of it, hoping to clear the taint of that vile stomach from his senses. He could still see it in his mind’s eye, and now that he was thinking about it he wanted to vomit.
 He forced himself to think of prettier things. The sun was now a bright pink line in the west and that pinkness washed over a smattering of faint stars who were just beginning to twinkle. The fractured face of the plateau below mirrored the color of the sky. 

Describe plateau.

Mandri pops the burgeon.



The reason Mandri hadn’t seen Ayram is because Ayram wasn’t weaving his way through the dark canyons, he was out on top of the plateau, looking a bit like a flea on the back of a scaled lizard hide. He was sprinting towards the temple, leaping across the canyon gaps as he went. Some of these gaps were larger than Mandri thought was possible to traverse, but as Ayram jumped, he stabbed the ground with spear and practically threw himself across. The speed and power was incredible, even viewed so far away.

        <Text>“Faster!” Elrahet cried. She twisted in her perch atop Ayram’s shoulders to glare at all who lagged behind. Mandri struggled to keep up. While the start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a canyon valley, Ayram’s pace was furious, and the giant scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree, and to Mandri’s unworked hands and feet it might as well have been a wall of thorns. Moto had to push him up, and Moteah had to pull him up over the top.
From there, they jogged along a shelf of sturdy rock which ran parallel to the road below until it dead ended into wall of reddish stone—solid stone save for a narrow crack which split it in two. The crack’s opening seemed only an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders, but somehow Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
 Mandri’s arms and legs bumped and scraped against the crack’s striated walls. If he wasn’t racked with exhaustion and fear he might have savored the scene—shades of red rock stacked on top each other to compose dramatic sweeping forms that towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky. The sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he ran along, and such was the height and swerve of the walls that the sunlight never touched the morass of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
 The way twisted and bent, right and left, and soon Mandri was so far behind that he rarely caught a glimpse of Moteah, much less anyone else beyond her. He was chasing the sounds of their paddling feet. Then he came to a fork in the road, and didn’t know which way to take, as the Ayramun had charged ahead without sparing care for him and Obo.
Before he could get too panicked, a packless, Elrahetless Ayram came sprinting back from the leftmost way.
“Keep going!” Ayram growled as he charged towards Mandri. It seemed as if the giant was about to tackle him, but Ayram stuck his iron spear into the sand and vaulted right over Mandri’s head.
 The giant landed as soft as rain, and when he did he shouted again, “Keep going!”. That set Mandri’s legs in motion, and he ran down the way Ayram had come, wondering why Ayram was headed back towards the Goree Pass. 
Mandri ran on and on without catching sight of anyone. Twice he asked Obo for confirmation that they were headed the right way, and Obo simply stated that there was only the one way to go. He also said to hurry up, for he could sense the Riga was warming its whistle.

Mandri’s sprint slowed to a half-hearted, heavy-breathing jog, for he was weak and the air was heating up. Unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off Mandri’s skin the moment it beaded up. Mandri’s lower back was achy and soggy and constantly patted by Obo’s bouncing litter. The vortex of steamy air that emerged there in that gap was a weather system unto itself, good for nothing but distracting Mandri from thinking about demons.
But it wasn’t a good enough distraction. Mandri marched at the quickest pace he could muster, and when this slowed to a walk he found himself searching the shadows for camouflaged demons that might leap out to snap at his leg.
He remembered the burgeon he’d stolen from Seb. If his eyes couldn’t see the demons that he felt must be near, then the God’s Eye sight might reveal them. He patted the burgeon bulb inside his robe to make sure it was still there. Then he heard a shout for his name up ahead, and he started running again.
The way belled out into a short stripe of rock-rubble valley. It was a miniature valley of sorts, as it was only there because a great length of the rock on either side had collapsed. The valley’s belly was clogged by a mound of rock, though enough of this mound had been cleared away to make a thin, passable trail. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope, was the Goree’s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision, and above that, the latter-day sun blazed down. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were the Ayramun. They were arguing about something, and as Mandri approached he heard Moto say, “…and no backtalk. And that goes for you too, Seb. You been getting uppity these days and it’s time to stop.”
Seb soured at this sudden turn. “I don’t give lip. I give suggestions.”
“No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
Mandri joined their huddle and asked, “What’s going on?”
“I’m in charge,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram went to go do Ayram things.”
“Ayram things?”
“He’s going to bother the Hrks and distract the Riga. Maybe even kill it. What we got to do is divvy up Ayram’s stuff and keep going.”

Mandri shrank back and raised his hands to surrender.
Moteah laughed.
“You got something to say?” Moto snapped at his sister.
“Come on,” said Moteah. “Look at him. He’s a twig, he can hardly carry himself and Obo.”
Moto’s jaw tightened. He stood up straighter. His nose flared as he sniffed that elevated air of authority. He pointed a finger at Moteah and declared, “Then you will carry his share.”
Moteah scoffed and settled in for a fight, getting right up into Moto’s face. “How about, for once, you take up the weight when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a slapback lizard unfurling it’s frills, he rolled his shoulders back to puff his chest. The siblings might have come to blows if a wad of borcandi juice didn’t go flying right between them.
“I’ll carry it,” Seb grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop bitchin’ and we can get on with it, I’ll carry the damn thing.”
“There’s no room in your pack,” said Moto.
“Sol’s sake, lash it to my spine then.”
Seb unshouldered her pack and dropped it at Moto’s feet. Moto kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he gathered some of Ayram’s gear and stuffed what he could into Seb’s pack.
Seb bore her new burden with the stolidity of an ox as she charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though her springy step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the added weight.
Elrahet followed after her, and after gathering some of Ayram’s things for herself, Moteah followed too, being sure to brush by her brother with a smirk.
Moto tossed a few blankets and the heavier ropes onto a nearby rock, as they weren’t needed. He then pointed after the others and said to Mandri, “Get going.”
Day progressed, the canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky dimmed into deeper hues. It wasn’t until the sun began to set when their path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau.
There, Mandri was greeted with a sight which crowded out all concerns—Hrks, Rigas, Amalgametes, demonry, his own exhaustion—for there in front of him was an enormous structure, at once a building and a mountain, at once a flat-topped chunk of natural stone looming into the sky and a richly ornamented temple, the walls of which were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes—circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles all joined together to roughly resemble faces. There were animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the nose of a snarling demon. It was patterns inside of patterns, lines inside of lines, and Mandri had to crane his neck to look up at it.
Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this temple should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered serve well to heighten the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crowns, and that’s even after accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays painted the stone with flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they’d have a much easier time of it because the building was a hollow husk. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arches, each as empty of candlelight as the next. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a female. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
“Looks like Seb was wrong,” Moteah whistled. “Shulgi is empty.”
“Seb is always wrong,” Moto sighed as he jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramun file. He guided them up the well-trodden slope to the foot of a long flight of stairs which led up to the temple entrance. These were troublesome stairs, and there were at least a hundred of them. They were steep, and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms for each step had its own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.
Three steps up and Mandri noticed a dark stain climbing up the stairs with him as he went. He guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be any number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement—a temple that large had to have drainage somewhere, though yes, it would be odd that they’d have it running out the front door. 
But he knew it was blood. 
Because of course it was blood.
There were demons about and there weren’t any people where people were expected to be.
It had to be blood. Blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under skin, it explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple’s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. Then his eyes alighted on the temple entrance, which itself had been sculpted in that curvilinear language into the head of a viper. Its fangs were similarly stained by that dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the building itself had eaten the Greskalun. 
They crossed the pillared court at a decent clip. Moto drew his sword as if to do battle with the building itself. He stopped before crossing the threshold. He peered inside, then drew away and said, “We’ll wait for Ayram somewhere else.”
Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion, “I’m not going back down,” she said. “I climbed up these steps and I’ll be damned if I don’t stick my head in and see what’s happened.”
“No,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram said that we should only wait inside if it was empty.”
“Someone get a torch going,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moteah was a step ahead of her, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks that Seb was holding. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.
Moto yanked the torch out of his sister’s hands.
“Ayram put me in charge,” he said.
Elrahet sneered. “Take charge of your wits and march yourself inside.”
Moto stewed in a wordless anger. He took a moment and a long-sipped breath to compose himself, and he thrust the torch into the temple interior. 
As soon he did, a swarm of bats screeched in the darkness and took flight. Their wingbeats battered the torch smoke as they swirled out of the viper’s mouth, and they swerved along the temple wall before disappearing into some unseen hole.
Moto had to start all over with his composure. When he was ready, he leaned into the temple entrance and sniffed the air. His face immediately soured.
“It smells horrible.”
Moteah agreed. “It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“I suppose you would know.”
“Get a move on,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone filtered in behind. Mandri looked over his shoulder to Obo before he entered. Obo simply nodded.
Shulgi’s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a barge, thrice as long, and at least twice Ayram’s height. The torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that was filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had swept some of this ash around the room, with trails of it sprinkling the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing the Ayramun, was a man sitting cross-legged.
Moto halted his people with a loud, “Ip!”, and he waved his torch back and forth.
The man did not move.
Moto shouted, “Hello!”, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.
The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was his black, ash splattered hair.
“Probably dead,” marked Seb.
“Oh, you think so?” said Moto.
“You’re the one that said ‘hello’ to it.”
Elrahet held out her hand towards Moto and made a grasping motion, requesting the torch. Moto handed it over, and with its light leading the way, she hobbled towards the mysterious figure. They all followed close behind.
“He must’ve been eating mice,” said Moto as he kicked a small spine that was lying on the floor.
“Or bats,” said Seb.
Now that Mandri knew that bones were there, he was seeing them everywhere, the scattered remains of small creatures littered the floor—thin boned lizard legs, bats, perhaps foxes, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. 
Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that cross-legged figure and poked him hard with her cane.
The man fell onto his side. His impact kicked up a cloud of ash.
“He is indeed dead,” Elrahet declared. “And he is not a man, or I should say, not wholly a man. His stomach is changed.”
She bent down and rubbed the dead man’s robe between her fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “This is the raiment of Greskal’s prince.”
Moteah then asked what Mandri was thinking, “Was he the Amalgamete?”
“An Amalgamete? Yes…The Amalgamete? No.”
Elrahet’s willingness to walk so far into the room gave Mandri the courage to join her. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be ‘inside’—that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so many days wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were dead critters and a dead body? So what if there were demons lurking in the shadows? It felt good to flout these ominous things. If he didn’t, he’d probably faint.
As he crept towards the fire-pit, he noticed a faint golden glimmer at the back of the room. He walked past Elrahet and the body, towards that glimmer, for shining faintly in the torch’s dancing light was an enormous golden statue of Solraheen sitting at the back of the hall.
As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a rare Old Jandri piece where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling—a form outlawed by Hrk, for it was sacrilegious to suggest that Solraheen’s principles did not dwell in Jeket. Here, His golden skin was smooth and His body featureless. His face was round, alive, and enlightened. His pose was rigid as a board, as if someone who had never sat before had the act described to them by blind man. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned in their sculptures, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to reality. It was more primitive, and therefore, more true. And it was huge, at least ten feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.
It was a beautiful sight. A source of serenity. None of it glittered as brightly as Mandrameen might have wanted, for a thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash had speckled His cheek. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. But what could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen’s golden skin was darkly mottled. It was tarnished.
Mandri winced at such impiety. Pure gold cannot tarnish, and so this meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals. No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their suffering. And worse—standing by Solraheen’s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine.
Now, he could not say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which couldn’t be ignored. Surely—surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.
One indignity to wash away another.
“They should have settled for a smaller statue,” Mandri mumbled.
“What’s that?” croaked Elrahet.
Mandri pointed to the statue. “It’s tarnished,” he said.
“What of it?”
“It’s not pure gold.”
Elrahet tissked at Mandri’s charge and winced as if it wounded her.
“Solraheen cares not for gold,” she said sharply. “What He cares about is this man,” she poked the dead man again with her cane, “And that poor thing there.” She pointed with the torch towards a dark lump sitting not ten feet away from Mandri. 
That round lump on the floot had an ear.
It had a mop of dark hair.
It had a neck, and attached to this neck were a few links of white spine. It was a face-down severed head, and what flesh there was looked like it had been gnawed.
Mandri scuffled back towards the others.
“You were right, Mazid,” said Elrahet to Obo, who fidgeted on Mandri’s back. “Though it wasn’t hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.”
Moto was standing over the green robed body. “Are you saying that this man ate that other man over there?” 
Elrahet nodded. “It was his final meal.”
“Ok, we’re leaving,” said Moto.
“No,” said Elrahet. “The struggle in this room is over.”
“We should burn it. That’s what we came here to do!”
Elrahet shook her head. “Don’t be so quick to judge those touched by the darkness, for there is no greater struggle. This was one of Solraheen’s champions. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it transformed him completely. See here—”
She held the torch low to the firepit. She poked around with her cane to reveal, half buried in ash, a large round stomach. Evidently the green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it the intestines behind, and these he’d cut as well and tossed into the ash. 
“If he had lost his battle, this world’s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand.”
The stomach was black, nearly as black as Fabled Black, and while that might be expected for flesh cooked in flames, it seemed to Mandri that the organ was blackened by evil.
Moteah asked, “Was he responsible for the pilgrims in the Pass?”
“Perhaps,” said Elrahet. She then pulled out her golden knife and cut the stomach open without effort. She used her cane to spread the halves apart, and she leaned over it as if to divine it.
Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ is subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance—there’s the stomach’s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the meaning of current and past events but predict the future. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach, that he would understand anything about what was going on, but after a half a finger of silent staring, the stomach squirmed and burped up a black puff of smoke that struck Mandri dumb with dread.
It didn’t take a witch to interpret this sign.
Evil was here.
Death was coming.
“Aaaaallllright,” said Moto, his voice uneven. “We’re leaving now!”
Elrahet ignored him and continued to sort through the stomach’s putrid contents with her blade, and her face grew more sullen with every poke. 
Moteah watched as if she could read it too. “He couldn’t be the Amalgamete we’ve been hunting.”
Elrahet grunted in agreement, then she wiped her blade clean on the dead man’s robe. “This stomach is not grown enough for foul work. Our hunt continues. We must keep moving.”
“Did you people not hear me?” Moto asked, unable to comprehend why no one would listen to him. “I said we’re waiting outside.”
“Wait outside? For what?”
“For Ayram!”
Elrahet sneered at Moto’s shoulder rolling gutlessness. “Ayram can’t kill the Amalgamete any more than you can. Young Mandri can hunt the beast alone, can’t you, boy? You and the Mazid strapped to your back.”
She hobbled over to where Mandri stood. She held the torch up over his head, then waved it from side to side, as if the light playing over his features revealed something truer about him than simple fear. When her eyes flitted towards his stomach he realized what she was really looking at. What she really studied were the threads of purpose binding him to everything else, binding him to Obo. He knew that she could see them, even if he could not, and she studied them with an artist’s eye. While the artist’s eye is the same as the lover's eye, it’s also the same as the covetous eye, the jealous eye, the hateful eye, it is noticing to remember, often called beholding, and Mandri did not like to be held by anyone, much less a sneering old crone with a wild eye peering up at him from under the shadow of her cowl.
“The boy is ready,” she said, and she swirled away and carried her torch towards the statue of Solraheen at the end of the hall.
“Ayram hunts the Riga. He hunts to give us the chance to hunt the Amalgamete. Now come!”</Text>

        <Title>Before Ixnay Obo</Title>
        <Text>“Faster!” Elrahet cried. She twisted in her perch atop Ayram’s shoulders to glare at all who lagged behind. Mandri struggled to keep up. The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a canyon valley but Ayram’s pace was furious. The giant scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree, and to Mandri’s unworked hands and feet it might as well have been a wall of thorns. Moto had to push him up, and Moteah had to pull him when he neared the top.
From there, they jogged along a shelf of sturdy rock which ran parallel to the road below until they came to a wall of reddish stone split by a narrow crack. The crack’s opening was hardly an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders, but somehow Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
 Mandri’s arms and legs bumped and scraped against the crack’s striated walls. If he wasn’t racked with exhaustion and fear he might have savored the scene, for shades of red rock stacked on top each other to compose dramatic sweeping forms. This beauty towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky, where the sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he ran along. Such was the height and swerve of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mush of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
 The way twisted and bent, right and left, and soon Mandri was so far behind that he rarely caught a glimpse of Moteah’s beige robe, much less anyone else beyond her. He was chasing the sounds of their paddling feet. Then he came to a fork in the road, and didn’t know which way to take, for the Ayramun had charged ahead without sparing care for him or Obo.
Before he could get too panicked, a packless, Elrahetless Ayram came sprinting back from the leftmost way.
“Keep going!” Ayram growled as he charged towards Mandri. It seemed as if the giant was about to tackle him, but Ayram stuck his iron spear into the sand and vaulted right over Mandri’s head.
 The giant landed as soft as rain. He shouted back, “Keep going!”, and he disappeared behind a bend. Mandri obeyed, he kept to the left and ran. He ran on and on without catching sight of anyone. Soon a whole hand had passed, measured out by the oppressive eye of the sun as it crossed the thin river of blue above. Mandri’s sprint slowed to a half-hearted jog. Unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off his skin the moment it beaded up. His lower back was achy and soggy and constantly scratched by Obo’s bouncing litter. The vortex of steamy air that emerged there in that gap was a weather system unto itself, good for nothing but distracting Mandri from thinking about his impending doom.
He marched at the quickest pace he could muster, and when this slowed to a walk he found himself searching the shadows for camouflaged demons that might leap out to snap at his leg.
He remembered the burgeon he’d stolen from Seb. If his eyes couldn’t see the demons that he felt must be near, then the God’s Eye sight might reveal them. He patted the burgeon bulb inside his robe to make sure it was still there, and just as he was about to spit its juice, he heard a shout for his name up ahead. He started running again.
The way belled out into a short stripe of rock-rubble valley. It was a miniature valley of sorts, as it was only there because a great length of the rock on either side had collapsed. The valley’s belly was clogged by a mound of rock, though enough of this mound had been cleared away to make a thin, passable trail. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope, was the Goree’s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision. Above that plateau was the blazing, latter-day sun. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were the Ayramun. They were arguing about something, and as Mandri approached he heard Moto say, “…and no backtalk. And that goes for you too, Seb. You been getting uppity these days and it’s time to stop.”
Seb soured at this sudden turn. “I don’t give lip, I give suggestions.”
“No suggestions, then. I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
Mandri joined their huddle and asked, “What’s going on?”
“I’m in charge,” said Moto firmly.
“Where’s Ayram?”
“The Riga stole Obo’s pseudospark, so he’s going to steal the Riga.”
“All by himself?”
“Not like any of us can keep up with him. No, what we got to do is divvy up Ayram’s stuff and keep running in case of Hrks.”
Ayram’s great pack was lying on the ground. The shadow it cast was almost as long as the shadow of the boulder Mandri was hiding in. Mandri let loose an exhausted groan and said, “I can’t carry any of that.”
Moto stared squarely at Mandri and said, stressing the threat of punishment, “You’ll do what I tell you to do.”
Mandri shrank back and raised his hands to surrender.
Moteah laughed.
“You got something to say?” Moto snapped at his sister.
“Come on,” said Moteah. “Look at him. He’s a twig, he can hardly carry himself and Obo.”
Moto’s jaw tightened. He stood up straighter. His nose flared as he sniffed that elevated air of authority. He pointed a finger at Moteah and declared, “Then you will carry his share.”
Moteah scoffed and got right up into Moto’s face. “How about, for once, you take up the weight when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a slapback lizard unfurling its frills he rolled his shoulders back to puff his chest. The siblings might have come to blows if a wad of borcandi juice didn’t go flying right between them.
“I’ll carry it,” Seb grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop bitchin’ and we can get on with it, I’ll carry the damn thing.”
“There’s no room in your pack,” said Moto.
“Sol’s sake, lash it to my spine then.”
Seb unshouldered her pack and dropped it at Moto’s feet. Moto kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he gathered some of Ayram’s gear and stuffed what he could into Seb’s pack.
Seb bore her new burden with the stolidity of an ox as she charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though her springy step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the added weight.
Elrahet followed after her, and after gathering some of Ayram’s things for herself, Moteah followed too, being sure to brush by her brother with a smirk.
Moto tossed a few blankets and the heavier ropes onto a nearby rock, as they weren’t needed. He then pointed after the others and said to Mandri, “Get going.”
Day progressed, the canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky dimmed into deeper hues. It wasn’t until the sun began to set when their path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau.
There, Mandri was greeted with a sight which crowded out all concerns—Hrks, Rigas, Amalgametes, demonry, his own exhaustion—for there in front of him was an enormous structure, at once a building and a mountain, at once a flat-topped chunk of natural stone looming into the sky and a richly ornamented temple, the walls of which were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes—circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles all joined together to roughly resemble faces. There were animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the nose of a snarling demon. It was patterns inside of patterns, lines inside of lines, and Mandri had to crane his neck to look up at it.
Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this temple should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered serve well to heighten the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crowns, and that’s even after accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays painted the stone with flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they’d have a much easier time of it because the building was a hollow husk. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arches, each as empty of candlelight as the next. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a female. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
“Looks like Seb was wrong,” Moteah whistled. “Shulgi is empty.”
“Seb is always wrong,” Moto sighed as he jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramun file. He guided them up the well-trodden slope to the foot of a long flight of stairs which led up to the temple entrance. These were troublesome stairs, and there were at least a hundred of them. They were steep, and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms for each step had its own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.

Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion, “I’m not going back down,” she said. “I climbed up these steps and I’ll be damned if I don’t stick my head in and see what’s happened.”
“No,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram said that we should only wait inside if it was empty.”
“Someone get a torch going,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moteah was a step ahead of her, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks that Seb was holding. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.
Moto yanked the torch out of his sister’s hands.
“Ayram put me in charge,” he said.
Elrahet sneered. “Take charge of your wits and march yourself inside.”
Moto stewed in a wordless anger. He took a moment and a long-sipped breath to compose himself, and he thrust the torch into the temple interior. 
As soon he did, a swarm of bats screeched in the darkness and took flight. Their wingbeats battered the torch smoke as they swirled out of the viper’s mouth, and they swerved along the temple wall before disappearing into some unseen hole.
Moto had to start all over with his composure. When he was ready, he leaned into the temple entrance and sniffed the air. His face immediately soured.
“It smells horrible.”
Moteah agreed. “It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“You would know.”
“Get a move on,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone filtered in behind.
Shulgi’s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a barge, thrice as long, and at least four times Mandri’s height. The torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that was filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had swept some of this ash around the room, with trails of it sprinkling the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing the Ayramun, was a man sitting cross-legged.
Moto halted his people with a loud, “Hip!”, and he waved his torch back and forth.
The man did not move.
Moto shouted, “Hello!”, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.
The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was his black, ash splattered hair.
“Probably dead,” marked Seb.
“Oh, you think so?” said Moto.
“You said ‘hello’ to it.”
Elrahet held out her hand towards Moto and made a grasping motion, requesting the torch. Moto handed it over, and with its light leading the way, she hobbled towards the mysterious figure. They all followed close behind.

She bent down and rubbed the dead man’s robe between her fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “This is the raiment of Greskal’s prince.”
Moteah then asked what Mandri was thinking, “Was he the Amalgamete?”
“An Amalgamete? Yes…The Amalgamete? No.”

It had a neck, and attached to this neck were a few links of white spine. What flesh there was looked like it had been gnawed.
Mandri scuffled away from this severed head, and crept back towards the Ayramun.
“The Mazid was right,” said Elrahet said. “Though it wasn’t hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.”
Moto was standing over the green robed body. “Are you saying that this man ate that other man over there?” 
Elrahet nodded. “It was his final meal.”
“Ok, we’re leaving,” said Moto.
“No,” said Elrahet. “The struggle in this room is over.”
“We should burn it. That’s what we came here to do!”
Elrahet shook her head. “Don’t be so quick to judge those touched by the darkness, for there is no greater struggle. This was one of Solraheen’s champions. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it transformed him completely. See here—”
She held the torch low to the firepit. She poked around with her cane to reveal, half buried in ash, a large round stomach. Evidently the green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it the intestines behind, and these he’d cut as well and tossed into the ash. 
“If he had lost his battle, this world’s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand.”
The stomach was black, nearly as black as Fabled Black, and while that might be expected for flesh cooked in flames, it seemed to Mandri that the organ was blackened by evil.
Moteah asked, “Was he responsible for the pilgrims in the Pass?”
“Perhaps,” said Elrahet. She then pulled out her golden knife and cut the stomach open without effort. She used her cane to spread the halves apart, and she leaned over it as if to divine it.
Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ is subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance—there’s the stomach’s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the meaning of current and past events but predict the future. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach, that he would understand anything about what was going on, but after a half a finger of silent staring, the stomach squirmed and burped up a black puff of smoke that struck Mandri dumb with dread.
It didn’t take a witch to interpret this sign.
Evil was here.
Death was coming.
“Aaaaallllright,” said Moto, his voice uneven. “We’re leaving now!”
Elrahet ignored him and continued to sort through the stomach’s putrid contents with her blade, and her face grew more sullen with every poke. 
Moteah watched as if she could read it too. “He couldn’t be the Amalgamete we’ve been hunting.”
“Did you people not hear me?” Moto asked, unable to comprehend why no one would listen to him. “I said we’re waiting outside.”
“Wait outside? For what?”
“For Ayram!”
Moto turned to leave, but as he did, a black shadow scurried through Shulgi’s threshold. He yelped and jumped back, and good thing he did, for standing there, framed by the doorway, was a demon roach the size of a dog.
It had an oily-black shell and human hands sprouting out the ends of its segmented legs. Its face was an unholy mix between an insect’s and a man’s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling. Its mouth gulped the air like fish out of water.
“Get back!” Elrahet shouted, but Moto and Moteah were already on their way, swords drawn. Mandri retreated all the way back to the statue of Solraheen. He would have climbed up onto Solraheen’s lap if he didn’t consider it to be sacrilege.
“It’s only a hag-beetle,” Elrahet said as the creature climbed up onto the wall. “It does have a spine inside its shell which can kill—careful when it opens.”
Both Moto and Moteah did not look eager to engage. Mandri clung to Solraheen’s foot.
Elrahet pointed to the demon and shouted, “Stiffen up and kill it!” She sneered at Moto’s shoulder rolling gutlessness. She was about to hit him with her cane when ten more hag-beetles scurried in from outside.
“What now!?” Moto shouted as he aimed his sword at the lead beetle advancing along the wall.
Elrahet said simply, “Run.”
Fear rooted to Solraheen’s side as Seb and Elrahet rushed by and fled into a hall nearby. Moto grabbed Mandri’s robe by the collar and yanked him along. Mandri didn’t find his feet until he got over the thought of Elrahet’s incompetence—if she could see the future, she should have been able to see a swarm of demons trapping them in this temple. Either she couldn’t see very far, or she’d led them here on purpose.</Text>

        <Title>Befory Reorder Hrk Entrance</Title>
        <Text>“Faster!” Elrahet cried. She twisted in her perch atop Ayram’s pack to glare at all who lagged behind. Mandri struggled to keep up. The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a gentle canyon but Ayram’s pace was furious. The giant scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree, and to Mandri’s unworked hands and feet it might as well have been a wall of thorns. Moto had to push him up, and Moteah had to pull him from above.
Atop this slope, they jogged along a shelf of sturdy rock which ran parallel to the road below until they came to a wall of red stone split by a narrow crack. The crack’s opening was hardly an inch wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders. Somehow Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
 Mandri’s arms and legs bumped and scraped against the crack’s striated walls. If he wasn’t racked with exhaustion and fear he might have savored the scene, for varying shades of red rock stacked on top each other to compose dramatic sweeping forms. This beauty towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky. There the sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandri as he ran himself ragged. Such was the height and swerve of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mush of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
 The way twisted and bent, right and left, and soon Mandri was so far behind that he rarely caught a glimpse of Moteah’s beige robe, much less anyone else beyond her. He chased the sounds of their paddling feet until he came to a fork in the road. He didn’t know which way to take, for the Ayramun had charged ahead without sparing a care for him.
Before he could get too panicked, a packless, Elrahetless Ayram came sprinting back from the leftmost way.
“Keep up!” he growled as he charged towards Mandri. It seemed as if the giant was about to tackle him, but the man stuck his iron spear into the sand and vaulted right over Mandri’s head.
He landed as soft as rain and shouted, “Go!”. Mandri obeyed. He kept to the left and ran. He ran on, and on, with Ayram right behind. He ran so long that the oppressive eye of the sun had time to cross the streamlet of sky above. Then his sprint slowed to a half-hearted jog. This was the quickest pace he could muster for at least half a hand, and when this slowed to a walk Ayram slapped the back of his head.
Mandri remembered the burgeon he’d stolen from Seb. He patted the burgeon bulb inside his robe to make sure it was still there, and just as he was about to spit its juice, he heard a shout for Ayram up ahead. Ayram called back with a whistle, and forced Mandri back into a sprint.
The way belled out into a valley rimmed by slopes of rubble. It was a miniature valley of sorts, as it was only there because a great length of the canyon on either side had collapsed. Enough of the rock had been cleared away to make a thin, passable trail. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope, was the Goree’s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision. Above that plateau was the blazing, latter-day sun. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were the Ayramun. They were arguing about something, and as Mandri approached he heard Moto say, “…and no lip. And that goes for you too, Seb. You’ve been getting all uppity it’s time to stop.”
Seb soured at this sudden turn. “I don’t give lip. I give the truth.”
“I swear,” said Moto, glaring. “You’ve got me halfway to breaking your jaw.”
They all made way for Mandri and Ayram to join their huddle in the shadow of an oblique standing stone.
Moto was the one to answer Ayram’s questioning look.
“I can’t carry all this,” he said, pointing to Ayarm’s propped up pack. “We have to stop and sort it out.” 
“The Hrkan Riga stole our Mazid’s breath. 

“I’m in charge,” said Moto firmly.
“Where’s Ayram?”
“The Riga stole Obo’s pseudospark, so he’s going to steal the Riga.”
“All by himself?”


Moto’s jaw tightened. He pointed a finger at Moteah and declared, “Then you carry it.”
Moteah scoffed and got right up into her brother’s face. “How about, for once, you take up the weight when Ayram gives it to you.”
All the muscles in Moto’s shoulders tensed up, and like a slapback lizard unfurling its frills he rolled his shoulders back to puff his chest. The siblings might have come to blows if a wad of borcandi juice didn’t go flying right between them.
“I’ll carry it,” Seb grumbled. “If’n it means you two stop bitchin’ and we can get on with it. I’ll carry the damn thing. Sol’s sake, lash it to my spine.”
“No,” said Ayram. “We stop here.”
“What? Why?”
“We make our stand here.”
“I thought we were going to—”
“This is perfect spot. There’s scraps of shadows everywhere. The Hrks will come in thin, then we’ll snag the Riga and keep running.”
“But what about—”
“Het will take Mandri up ahead. He’ll be the bait. The rest of you...”
The rest of them were already dumping their packs and preparing for a fight.
But the fight was upon them before , 
“Hah-HA!” he exclaimed triumphantly. “As I predicted.” He was a zosan, dark skin, with a natural limp in his step. The soldier next to him fumbled with his horn, but the scribe caught his elbow. “It’s a little soon for that, don’t you think?”
He stood straighter. His nose flared as he sniffed that elevated air of authority, and shouted towards the Ayramun, “It is good that you’ve given up the chase! There is no place where we would not have followed.”

Mandri looked for the riga, but did not see it. 
“You pokes never learn. When you try draw up water you cannot reach, the effort makes you weak. You end up worse off than having nothing at all.”
Well pleased with his proverb.
“Hand over the Mazid.”
“How about a trade?”
“You have nothing I want.”
“We have the Mazid.”
“Ah, you misread the situation. That Mazid already belongs to the Lordship. It is a simple matter of retrieving it. If you do not resist we might…well…to be honest, you should probably resist.”


For there, a naked child with a distended belly sporting Schisol’s swirl stepped up to the edge. 
Look around in utter confustion, not least the scribe. He turned to a nearby soldier and commanded, “You there, bring that thing down.”
“I said bring it down, not kill it.”
And stepped forward, the child had thrown a rock right at his head. And crumpled him. 

Day progressed, the canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky dimmed into deeper hues. It wasn’t until the sun began to set when their path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau.
There, Mandri was greeted with a sight which crowded out all concerns—Hrks, Rigas, Amalgametes, demonry, his own exhaustion—for there in front of him was an enormous structure, at once both a building and a mountain; a flat-topped chunk of natural stone looming into the sky and a richly ornamented temple, the walls of which were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes—circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles all joined together to roughly resemble faces. There were animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the nose of a snarling demon. It was patterns inside of patterns, lines inside of lines, and Mandri had to crane his neck to look up at it.
Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this temple should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered serve well to heighten the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crowns, and that’s not even accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays painted the stone with flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they’d have a much easier time of it because the building was a hollow husk. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arches, each as empty of candlelight as the next. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a female. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
“Looks like Seb was wrong,” Moteah whistled. “Shulgi is empty.”
“Seb is always wrong,” Moto sighed as he jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramun file. He guided them up the well-trodden slope to the foot of a long flight of stairs which led up to the temple entrance. These were troublesome stairs, and there were at least a hundred of them. They were steep, and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms for each step had its own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.
Three steps up and Mandri noticed a dark stain climbing up the stairs with him as he went. He guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be any number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement—a temple that large had to have drainage somewhere, though yes, it would be odd that they’d have it running out the front door. 
But he knew it was blood. 
Because of course it was blood.
There were demons about and there weren’t any people where people were expected to be.
It had to be blood. Blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under skin, it explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple’s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. Then his eyes alighted on the temple entrance, which itself had been sculpted in that curvilinear language into the head of a viper. Its fangs were similarly stained by that dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the building itself had eaten the Greskalun. 
They crossed the pillared court at a decent clip. Moto drew his sword as if to do battle with the building itself. He stopped before crossing the threshold. He peered inside, then drew away and said, “We’ll wait for Ayram somewhere else.”
Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion, “I’m not going back down,” she said. “I climbed up these steps and I’ll be damned if I don’t stick my head in and see what’s happened.”
“No,” said Moto firmly. “Ayram said that we should only wait inside if it was empty.”
“Someone get a torch going,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moteah was a step ahead of her, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks that Seb was holding. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.
Moto yanked the torch out of his sister’s hands.
“Ayram put me in charge,” he said.
Elrahet sneered. “Take charge of your wits and march yourself inside.”
Moto stewed in a wordless anger. He took a moment and a long-sipped breath to compose himself, and he thrust the torch into the temple interior. 
As soon he did, a swarm of bats screeched in the darkness and took flight. Their wingbeats battered the torch smoke as they swirled out of the viper’s mouth, and they swerved along the temple wall before disappearing into some unseen hole.
Moto had to start all over with his composure. When he was ready, he leaned into the temple entrance and sniffed the air. His face immediately soured.
“It smells horrible.”
Moteah agreed. “It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“You would know.”
“Get a move on,” Elrahet grumbled.
Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone filtered in behind.
Shulgi’s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a barge, thrice as long, and at least four times Mandri’s height. The torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that was filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had swept some of this ash around the room, with trails of it sprinkling the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing the Ayramun, was a man sitting cross-legged.
Moto halted his people with a loud, “Hip!”, and he waved his torch back and forth.
The man did not move.
Moto shouted, “Hello!”, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.
The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was his black, ash splattered hair.
“Probably dead,” marked Seb.
“Oh, you think so?” said Moto.
“You said ‘hello’ to it.”
Elrahet held out her hand towards Moto and made a grasping motion, requesting the torch. Moto handed it over, and with its light leading the way, she hobbled towards the mysterious figure. They all followed close behind.
“He must’ve been eating mice,” said Moto as he kicked a small spine that was lying on the floor.
“Or bats,” said Seb.
Now that Mandri knew that bones were there, he was seeing them everywhere, the scattered remains of small creatures littered the floor—thin boned lizard legs, bats, perhaps foxes, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. 
Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that cross-legged figure and poked him hard with her cane.
The man fell onto his side. His impact kicked up a cloud of ash.
“He is indeed dead,” Elrahet declared. “And he is not a man, or I should say, not wholly a man. His stomach is changed.”
She bent down and rubbed the dead man’s robe between her fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “This is the raiment of Greskal’s prince.”
Moteah then asked what Mandri was thinking, “Was he the Amalgamete?”
“An Amalgamete? Yes…The Amalgamete? No.”
Elrahet’s willingness to walk so far into the room gave Mandri the courage to join her. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be ‘inside’—that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so many days wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were dead critters and a dead body? So what if there were demons lurking in the shadows? It felt good to flout these ominous things. If he didn’t, he’d probably faint.
As he crept towards the fire-pit, he noticed a faint golden glimmer at the back of the room. He walked past Elrahet and the body, towards that glimmer, for shining faintly in the torch’s dancing light was an enormous golden statue of Solraheen sitting at the back of the hall.
As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a rare Old Jandri piece where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling—a form outlawed by Hrk, for it was sacrilegious to suggest that Solraheen’s principles did not dwell in Jeket. Here, His golden skin was smooth and His body featureless. His face was round, alive, and enlightened. His pose was rigid as a board, as if someone who had never sat before had the act described to them by blind man. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned in their sculptures, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to reality. It was more primitive, and therefore, more true. And it was huge, at least ten feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.
It was a beautiful sight. A source of serenity. None of it glittered as brightly as Mandrameen might have wanted, for a thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash had speckled His cheek. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. But what could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen’s golden skin was darkly mottled. It was tarnished.
Mandri winced at such impiety. Pure gold cannot tarnish, and so this meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals. No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their suffering. And worse, standing by Solraheen’s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine.
Now, he could not say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which couldn’t be ignored. Surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.
One indignity to wash away another.
“They should have settled for a smaller statue,” Mandri mumbled.
“What’s that?” croaked Elrahet.
Mandri pointed to the statue. “It’s tarnished,” he said.
“What of it?”
“It’s not pure gold.”
Elrahet tissked at Mandri’s charge and winced as if it wounded her.
“Solraheen cares not for gold,” she said sharply. “What He cares about is this man,” she poked the dead man again with her cane, “And that poor thing there.” She pointed with the torch towards a dark lump on the floor. It wasn’t but ten feet away from Mandri. 
It had a mop of dark hair.
It had a human ear.
It had a neck, and attached to this neck were a few links of white spine. What flesh there was looked like it had been gnawed.
Mandri scuffled away from this severed head, and crept back towards the Ayramun.
“The Mazid was right,” said Elrahet said. “Though it wasn’t hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.”
Moto was standing over the green robed body. “Are you saying that this man ate that other man over there?” 
Elrahet nodded. “It was his final meal.”
“Ok, we’re leaving,” said Moto.
“No,” said Elrahet. “The struggle in this room is over.”
“We should burn it. That’s what we came here to do!”
Elrahet shook her head. “Don’t be so quick to judge those touched by the darkness, for there is no greater struggle. This was one of Solraheen’s champions. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it transformed him completely. See here—”

“If he had lost his battle, this world’s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand.”
The stomach was black, nearly as black as Fabled Black, and while that might be expected for flesh cooked in flames, it seemed to Mandri that the organ was blackened by evil.

That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach, that he would understand anything about what was going on, but after a half a finger of silent staring, the stomach squirmed and burped up a black puff of smoke that struck Mandri dumb with dread.
It didn’t take a witch to interpret this sign.
Evil lived here.
Death was coming.
“Aaaaallllright,” said Moto, his voice uneven. “We’re leaving now!”
Elrahet ignored him and continued to sort through the stomach’s putrid contents with her blade, and her face grew more sullen with every poke. 
Moteah watched as if she could read it too. “He couldn’t be the Amalgamete we’ve been hunting.”
“Did you not hear me?” Moto asked, unable to comprehend why no one would listen to him. “I said we’re waiting outside.”
“Wait outside? For what?”
“For Ayram!”




Moto turned to leave, but as he did, a black shadow scurried through Shulgi’s threshold. He yelped and jumped back, and good thing he did, for standing there, framed by the doorway, was a demon roach the size of a dog.
It had an oily-black shell and human hands sprouting out the ends of its segmented legs. Its face was an unholy mix between an insect’s and a man’s, flat and bug-eyed, lidless, staring up at the ceiling. Its mouth gulped the air like fish out of water.
“Get back!” Elrahet shouted, but Moto and Moteah were already on their way, swords drawn. Mandri retreated all the way back to the statue of Solraheen. He would have climbed up onto Solraheen’s lap if he didn’t consider it to be sacrilege.
“It’s only a hag-beetle,” Elrahet said as the creature climbed up onto the wall. “It does have a spine inside its shell which can kill—careful when it opens.”
Both Moto and Moteah did not look eager to engage. Mandri clung to Solraheen’s foot.
Elrahet pointed to the demon and shouted, “Stiffen up and kill it!” She sneered at Moto’s shoulder rolling gutlessness. She was about to hit him with her cane when ten more hag-beetles scurried in from outside.




“What now!?” Moto shouted as he aimed his sword at the lead beetle advancing along the wall.
Elrahet said simply, “Run.”
Fear rooted to Solraheen’s side as Seb and Elrahet rushed by and fled into a hall nearby. Moto grabbed Mandri’s robe by the collar and yanked him along. Mandri didn’t find his feet until he got over the thought of Elrahet’s incompetence—if she could see the future, she should have been able to see a swarm of demons trapping them in this temple. Either she couldn’t see very far, or she’d led them here on purpose.</Text>

        <Title>Introduce Pyetle</Title>
        <Text>It had been a while since Mandri had seen so many men gathered at once. Description of them.
The Ayramun were forced to lead. His pace was furious, and his path-finding was nonsensical. The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a winding canyon.  Once around the fist bend, the giant scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree. Pyetle assumed the giant was attempting an escape, but Ayram waited at the top for all to follow. To Mandri’s unworked hands and feet it might as well have been a wall of thorns. Moto had to push him up from behind, and Moteah had to pull him from above. Pyetle was forced to leave his horse behind with a bevy of men.
Once atop this slope, they shimmied along a shelf of sturdy rock which ran parallel to the road below until they came to a narrow crack in the wall of red stone behind them. The crack’s opening was hardly wider than the width of Mandri’s shoulders. Somehow, Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step.
 It waseven tougher going from then on. If Mandri wasn’t racked with fear he might have savored the scene, for the stacked layers of rock on either side were were made of chalky reds bent into dramatic, sweeping forms. This beauty towered overhead and bracketed a thin, winding strip of blue sky above. There the sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandri as he ran himself ragged. Such was the height and swerve of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mush of sand and fallen rock that was the floor.
Mandri ran on, and on, with Seb right behind. He ran so long that the oppressive sun had time to cross the streamlet of sky above. Ayram’s sprint eventually slowed to a half-hearted jog, but this was still a faster pace than Mandri could muster. He began to fall behind, and when he slowed to a walk Seb slapped the back of his head.
Mandri consoled himself with the thought of the God’s Eye burgeon in his pocket. He patted the bulb inside his robe to make sure his little victory was still there. That’s when he heard a thumb-finger whistle calling from up ahead. Seb called back with a whit-wheeting whistle, and she forced Mandri back into a sprint.
The way belled out into a valley fringed by slopes of rubble. It was a miniature valley of sorts, recently made as a great length of the canyon on either side had collapsed. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope, was the Goree’s tallest plateau. It stretched beyond vision. Above that plateau was the blazing, latter-day sun. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were the Ayramun, waiting for Mandri and Seb to catch up.
“We’re almost there,” Moteah said upon seeing Mandri’s pained expression.
“Almost where?”
“You’ll see.”
Day progressed, the canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky dimmed into deeper hues. The sky was pink when their path began to lead upwards, first up a steep rise and then a more gradual slope that emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau.
There, Mandri was greeted with a sight which crowded out his aches. Some hundred yards away was the start of a dizzying staircase which led up to another massive plateau. Halfway through tired groan he realized that the massive plateau above was actually a temple. It drew high into the sky, a single curved wall embossed with geometric patterns—circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles all joined together to roughly resemble faces. From a distance, there were animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape. The nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the skull of what seemed to be a mouse. It was patterns inside of patterns, lines inside of lines, densely packed, wrapping around the rock like some kaleidoscopic belt.
Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this temple should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered heighten the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crowns, and that’s not even accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays painted the stone with flame.
The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have conquered it a long time ago. If they learned of it now, they’d have an easier time of it because the building appeared to be deserted. Above the graven faces on the temple’s wall were rows of mullioned arches, each as empty of candlelight as the next. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a lizard lady. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. 
“Looks like Seb was wrong,” Moteah whistled. “Shulgi is empty.”
“Seb is always wrong,” Moto sighed.
Ayram guided them up a well-trodden slope to the foot of the long flight of stairs which led up to the temple entrance. These were troublesome stairs, and there were at least two hundred of them. They were steep, and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms for each step had its own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.
Three steps up and Mandri noticed a dark stain climbing up the stairs with him as he went. He guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be any number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement—a temple that large had to drain out somewhere, though it would be odd that they’d have it running out the front door. 
But he knew it was blood. 
Because of course it was blood.
There was evil near, and there weren’t any people where people were expected to be.
That meant demons. And that meant blood. Blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under skin. It explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple’s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. Then his eyes alighted on the temple entrance, itself a curvilinear sculpture to match the designs on the wall; this one a head of a viper. Its fangs were similarly stained by that dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the building itself had eaten the Greskalun. More explanatory power.
They crossed the pillared court at a decent clip. Moto drew his sword as if to do battle with the building itself. He stopped before crossing the threshold. He peered inside, then drew away and said to Ayram, “I suppose  you should go first.”
For the first time in perhaps his life, Ayram was worried. He hesitated before the yawning entrance.
Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion. “We are not going back,” she said resolutely.
“Someone get a torch going,” Ayram grumbled.
Moto was a step ahead of him, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.
Moto sipped a long breath to compose himself, and he thrust the torch into the temple interior. 
Sent a swarm of bats screeching and the Ayramun reeling. The creature’s took flight, they swarmed out of the entrance in a frightening swarm. Their wingbeats battered the torch smoke as they swirled out of the viper’s mouth, and they swerved along the temple wall before disappearing into some unseen hole.
After the last few stragglers dripped out, Moto recomposed himself and leaned his torch back into the temple entrance.
When nothing stirred, he leaned himself in as well and sniffed the air.
His face immediately soured.
“It smells horrible.”
Moteah agreed. “It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“You would know.”
“Get a move on,” Ayram grumbled.
Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone else filtered in behind with Ayram ensuring the rear.
Shulgi’s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a Lord’s barge, thrice as long, and at least four times Mandri’s height. Moto’s torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that was filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had swept some of this ash around the room, with trails of it sprinkling the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing the Ayramun, was a man sitting cross-legged.
Moto halted his column with an outstretched arm, and he waved his torch back and forth.
The man did not move.
“Hello!”, Moto shouted, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.
The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was his black, ash matted hair.
“Probably dead,” Seb marked.
“You think so?” said Moto dryly.
“You the one who said ‘hello’ to it.”
Elrahet made a grasping motion towards Moto, requesting the torch. Moto acquiesced, and with the torchlight leading the way, Elrahet hobbled towards the mysterious figure. Everyone else followed with much less surety in their step.
“He must’ve been eating mice,” said Moto as he kicked a small spine that was lying on the floor.
“Or the bats,” said Seb.
Now that Mandri knew that bones were there he was seeing them everywhere. The scattered remains of small creatures littered the floor—thin boned lizard legs, bats, perhaps foxes, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too. Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that cross-legged figure and poked him hard with her cane.
The man fell onto his side. His impact kicked up a cloud of ash.
“He is indeed dead,” Elrahet declared. “And he is not a man, or I should say, not wholly a man. His stomach is changed.”
She bent down and rubbed the dead man’s robe between her fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “This is the raiment of a prince.”
Moteah then asked what Mandri was thinking, “This is Greskal?”
“Greskal’s son.”
“He’s not the Amalgamete?”
“No. But he almost was.”
Elrahet’s willingness to walk so far into the room gave Mandri the courage to join her. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be ‘inside’—that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so many days wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were dead creatures and a dead body and general atmosphere of gloom? So what if there were demons lurking in the shadows? It felt good to flout these ominous things. If he didn’t, he’d probably faint.
He crept towards the fire-pit and noticed a faint golden glimmer at the back of the room. He walked past Elrahet and the firepit, towards that glimmer, for shining faintly in the torch’s dancing light was an enormous golden statue of Solraheen sitting at the back of the hall.
As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a rare Old Jandri piece where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling—a form outlawed by Hrk, for it was sacrilegious to suggest that Solraheen did not dwell in Jeket alone. Here, His golden skin was smooth and His body featureless. His face was round, alive, and enlightened. His pose was rigid as a board, as if crafted by someone who had never sat before and had the act described. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to reality. It was more primitive, and therefore, more true. And it was huge, at least ten feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.
It was a beautiful sight. A source of serenity. None of it glittered as brightly as Mandri might have wanted, for a thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash speckled Him over. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. But what could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen’s golden skin was darkly mottled.
Tarnished.
Mandri cringed at the impiety. Pure gold cannot tarnish. This meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals.
No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their suffering.
And worse, standing by Solraheen’s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine.
It was impossible to say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which could not be ignored. Surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.
One indignity to wash away another.
“They should have settled for a smaller statue,” Mandri mumbled.
“What’s that?” Elrahet croaked.
Mandri pointed to the statue. “It’s tarnished,” he said.
“What of it?”
“It’s not pure gold.”
Elrahet tissked at Mandri’s charge and winced as if it wounded her.
“Sol cares not for gold,” she said sharply. “What He cares about is this man,” she poked the dead prince again with her cane, “And that poor thing there.” She pointed with the torch towards a dark lump on the floor. It wasn’t but ten feet away from Mandri. 
It had a mop of dark hair.
It had a human ear.
It had a neck, and attached to this neck were a few links of spine. What flesh there was looked like it had been munched on.
Mandri shuffled away from this severed head, and crept back towards the Ayramun.
“Bastard must’ve been hungry,” Seb joked.
“No,” Elrahet corrected. “It wasn’t hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.”
Moto was standing over the green robed body. “This man ate that other man over there?” 
Elrahet nodded. “It was his final meal.”
“Okay, we’re leaving,” said Moto.
“There is nothing to fear here,” said Elrahet. “The struggle which took place in this room is over.”
“We should burn it,” Moteah suggested.
Elrahet shook her head. “Don’t be so quick to judge those fell into Schisol’s shadow. There is no greater struggle. This boy was one of Solraheen’s champions. He was braver than any of you. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it transformed him completely. See here—”
She held the torch low to the firepit. She poked around with her cane to reveal, half buried in ash, a large round stomach. Evidently the green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure which dragged with it the intestines, and these he’d cut as well and tossed into the ash. 
“If he had lost his battle, this world’s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand. We’d have two Amalgametes instead of one.”
The stomach was black, nearly as black as Fabled Black, and while that might be expected for flesh cooked in flames, it seemed to Mandri that the organ was blackened by evil.
Moteah asked, “Was he responsible for the pilgrims in the Pass?”
“Perhaps,” said Elrahet. She then pulled out her golden knife and cut the stomach open without effort. She used her cane to spread the halves apart, and she leaned over it as if to divine it.
Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew that the stomach was the seat of the Spark, and that the organ is subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance—there’s the stomach’s stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there are the patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the meaning of current and past events but predict the future. That was all that Mandri knew. It was not a functional knowledge. He did not expect, when Elrahet cut into that black stomach, that he would understand anything about what was going on, but after a half a finger of silent staring, the stomach squirmed and burped up a black puff of smoke that struck Mandri dumb with dread.
It didn’t take a witch to interpret this sign.
Evil lived here.
Death was coming.
“Aaaaallllright,” said Moto, his voice uneven. “We’re leaving now!”
Elrahet ignored him and continued to sort through the stomach’s putrid contents with her blade, and her face grew more sullen with every poke. 
Moteah watched as if she could read it too.
“It wasn’t him,” she said.
“What do you mean?”
It was Elrahet who answered. “This is not the one who poled those pilgrims. There is another, and he is close. He is here.”

        <Title>Ixnay Riga</Title>
        <Text>The vessels of Hrk wore their plain white robes proudly. Their Hrk-white cloaks, trimmed with color, were almost dust free. Quite the accomplishment. Mandri wondered if they’d developed some secret oil bath which held the cloth strong against the smear of sand, sweat, and difficulty. They should have applied it to the skin before stepping into the courtyard, for there the men themselves unraveled. Half of them cried out at the smell of the pilgrim poles, a few vomited at the sight, the rest were enraged. There wasn’t one level head among them, save for Pyetle, who was inevitable up on his horse. He barked orders with clean diction, orders assiduously planned just for such an occasion.
The men were reorganized into their squares.
A squad of the literate was formed to anatomize the scene.
Messengers were dispatched.
Scouts were ordered to seek water and foraging opportunities for their continued journey.
“A return journey,” was Pyetle’s hope. When Moto implied their imminent death by saying there might not be a return journey, Pyetle laughed. 
“We can manage a demon or two,” he said. “Or twenty.” He then ordered Ayram to move ahead and give tongue the moment he saw any sign of their quarry. Ayram assented with a grunt.
The start of the Goree Pass was a gently rising wagon path leading into a winding canyon. Once around the fist bend, Ayram scrambled up a slope to the left, a near vertical scree. Pyetle ordered most to follow. To Mandri’s unworked hands, the slope might as well have been a wall of thorns. Moto had to push him up from behind, and Moteah had to pull him from above.
Down below, Pyetle took pause to consider how to divide his force. He couldn’t bring his horse up with him. Then there was the matter of the Riga child. He decided in the end to leave them both behind with a small bevy of men, for their protection. After giving the order he paused to consider the look of doom Elrahet was channeling. The sun was high and behind her, so her stooped figure cast an long, ominous shadow down the length of the slope, ending right at Pyetle’s feet
“Is something the matter?” he asked.
Mandri couldn’t quite see Elrahet’s face from where he stood, but he could feel a black loathing emanating from her cowl.
“It would be wise to bring the Riga.” Elrahet grumbled, her words rolling down the rocky slope like warning stones. “Wiser still to restore the Mazid’s breath. Only Mazidfire can defeat what awaits us.”
Pyetle smiled back proudly. “Do you think me stupid?” he asked. “I would never unleash that Mazid. That would defeat the whole purpose of my being here.”
“Come then!” Elrahet hissed. She flicked her hand at the Hrkan commander. “And do leave strong men behind. You’ll need them to tender your carcass to the knackers.”
Mandri was sad to see the Riga be lifted up onto Pyetle’s horse and trotted away. It was like watching a debt collector making off with half his harvest. It meant he would have to get used to the hunger for breath. And there was the hunger of speech as well. He had a few choice words he wanted to share with the soldiers who cursed at him as they climbed up the slope.
The first of them, a swarthy man with a twisted nose spat on Mandri’s shoes.
“That’s the last bit o’ water you’ll take from me!”
Other Hrks assembled variations on this theme. Apparently Pyetle had driven his men hard for days without stopping to find a well. One man patted down Mandri’s robe,looking for a waterskin. When it was clear Mandri had nothing to steal, he worked in an elbow to the ribs.
Once everyone had climbed up to this wide shelf of sturdy rock, the Ayramun were split apart. Ayram, the spotter, the wayfinder, was kept in front, while Elrahet was kept in back. The rest were divvied up and lost amongst a white cloud of shared suspicion. Mandri moved somewhere in the middle, sandwiched between two unwashed loaves of man.
At length, the way dipped into a narrow crack set into in the northern rock face. The crack’s opening was hardly wider than Mandri’s shoulders. Ayram barreled into it without so much as a stutter step; it was his trademark cat-like, lizard-like, bendy-bone movement, feral movement, and the Hrkan soldier nearest Mandri muttered, “Demon!”
This drew a click of the tongue from Pyetle, alongside an order to follow.
One by one, they all squeezed into the chasm.
It was tougher going from then on. If Mandri wasn’t racked with anxiety he might have savored the scene, for the stacked layers of rock on either side were were made from chalky reds bent into dramatic, sweeping forms, with both sides bracketing a thin, winding strip of sky in which the sun was happy to play a game of peekaboo. Such was the height and swerve of the walls that the sunlight never touched the mush of sand and fallen rock that was the floor. And they marched so long that the sun had time to hop the streamlet of sky above and disappear altogether.
Mandri consoled himself with the thought of the God’s Eye burgeon in his pocket. He patted the bulb to make sure the little beauty was still there. 
It was.
“Git movin’!”
Mandri hustled to catch up with the fluttering white cloak in front him.
He next found himself in the bottom of a belled out valley whose slopes bulged with piles of red sandstone. It seemed as if a great length of the chasm on either side had collapsed. To the left, towering above the precarious western slope, was the Goree’s tallest plateau, which stretched beyond vision. Above that plateau was the blazing, latter-day sun. Hiding in the shadows of the larger rocks were blots of soldiers. Among them, Moteah, who kept a keen eye on Mandri.
“We’re almost there,” she said upon seeing Mandri’s pained expression.
“Almost where?” a rather haggard soldier asked.
Moteah did not answer him.
From then on, the Hrkan march was stretched into a trickle of white-cloaks dribbling down rubble strewn paths. As the day progressed, the brilliant blue of the sky dimmed into its deeper hues. The shadows grew black. It was then that their path began to lead more steeply upwards. Soon it emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau, though there was still a little ways yet to reach the sky.
When Mandri next lifted his eyes from the ankle-twisting rocks, he saw, some hundred yards away, the start of a dizzying staircase rising up to another massive plateau. Halfway through a tired, silent groan, he realized that the massive plateau in front of him, that monumental knob of rock, was actually a building. 
It drew itself up high, exposing a rocky skin incised with thin geometric patterns which flared pink in the light of the setting sun. Such was the hour that the pink gradated into red at at the mountain’s peak. After Mandri blinked his astonishment, he saw that the patterns, the diamonds, squares, and triangles, were joined together to paint abstract faces. There were animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval taller than ten men demarcated the edges of a fox’s gape. The nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a hawk, and the beak of the hawk was the tooth of the fox and also the skull of a mouse. This parade of creation wrapped all the way around the structure’s like a belt.
Mandri had never seen the like in a painting. All the monumental wonders get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights this isolated temple should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered vitalize the glory of the conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the Lordly crown, and that’s not even accounting for the effects of the sun’s red rays painting the stone with flame. The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Lords did not know of it. If they had, they would have conquered it a long time ago.
They’d have an easier time of it now because the building appeared to be deserted. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that’s been brushed with the scent of a female. 
When it was Mandri’s turn to climb the stairs, he took his time. There were at least two-hundred steps. They were steep and uneven. The wear of ages had them looking like layers of melted wax. And there was a dark stain was climbing up them. Mandri guessed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn’t oil, well, it could be any number of other substances. Perfumed wine, red berry brine, or ink. It could be slurried excrement—a temple that large had to drain out somewhere. Odd that they’d have it running out the front door. 
But he knew it was blood. 
Because of course it was blood.
There weren’t any people where people were expected to be.
And there was a demon somewhere near.
Blood had explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under his skin. It explained why his knees trembled and why, as he crested the final stair and stepped onto the temple’s forecourt, why he felt the urge to flee. And that wasn’t the end of it, for the many lines which drew the faces on the temple’s wall converged above the tall, narrow entrance into the mountain, and the point of convergence, the curved entrance arch, was stained by that same dark substance, leading Mandri to wonder if the Greskalun had disappeared because they’d been eaten by the building itself.
More explanatory power.
“Form up!” Pyetle barked, his voice a little weak in this thinner mountain air.
Someone grabbed Mandri by the neck and arranged him alongside the Hrkan squares.
When they were all finally gathered atop that barren table of rock, Pyetle began his final review. His eyes ticked proudly from face to face, but a sudden realization dawned and his brows quickly drew together. He stepped back, marched quickly up and down the five-fold squares while his concern gradually turned into panic.
“Where is he!?”
No one answered.
Pyetle ceased his pacing and revised the question.
“Where is the giant!?”
Mandri stood tip-toe to survey the swarm of bobbing white headscarves. Moto was there. Moteah, too, as well as Seb and Elrahet, all of them spread out like splintered wood amidst the sea of white-cloaks. Ayram’s towering frame should have been a black mast amongst them. He was missing.
“Who was charged with the giant’s keeping?”
A man in the first square wavered for a moment, then stepped forward. Anxiety rippled his words.
“They appear to be missing.” 
“WHAT!?” 
“Dars and Fally. They were with the giant. I suggest they’ve gone ahead, ventured into the building.”
“I was the first up the stair,” Pyetle countered. “I saw no one. They were behind!”
“I suggest that—”
“Quiet!”
Pyetle took a moment to compose himself. He then strode towards the veritable cliff behind him, but promptly dismissed the possibility that the giant had jumped off. His next suspicion fell upon Elrahet. He posted up in front of her and asked, calmly, “Where is he?”
Mandri could not see Elrahet’s scowl, but he could watch it work on Pyetle’s round face. The man’s right eye twitched. His full lips curled into a frown. His stiff beard bulged as he bit his tongue.
“I should guess,” Elrahet mumbled, “That he fled.”
The Hrk to Mandri’s left groaned. A curse reserved for liars was uttered—something to do with raking tongues against fish skin. Half the crowd murmured agreement. All this widened the crack in Pyetle’s calm facade, as now his attention was split between a defiant witch and his own insubordinate men.
Then shout came from the mountain entrance.
“Sir! There is someone in here!”
Pyetle spun around and hurried up to the threshold. He drew his sword as if to do battle with the mountain itself, then peered inside. After a moment’s inspection, he shouted, “Fetch the pokes!”
Mandri was picked up, carried, and dropped at Pyetle’s feet. The rest of the Ayramun were borne forth in a similar manner, save for Elrahet. She was driven towards the entrance arch by the threat of a spear.
“One of you get a torch going.”
Moto unshouldered his pack and quickly found the materials for a torch. He laid out a bundle of dried grass and resin, then knapped sparks onto it. Soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of the blackest smoke swirling into the air. He applied this flame to a pitch-wrapped stick, and offered it to Pyetle.
“No,” Pyetle said. “You are going in first.” 
Moto shrugged his shoulders—his way of calling Pyetle a coward. He then stood up, walked into the mouth of the mountain, and thrust his torch into its interior.
He immediately spun around and cupped his nose with the crook of his elbow.
“It smells like stale piss.”
“All piss smells stale,” said Seb.
“You would know.”
“Get on with it,” Pyetle commanded.
Moto turned back, held his torch aloft and stepped into the darkness. Pyetle followed, along with a few of his men. Mandri and the others were forced in behind.
The entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a Lord’s barge, thrice as long, and at least four times Mandri’s height. Moto’s torchlight could only tease the distant wall. In the middle of this dimness, dug out into the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit filled to the brim with white ash. Wind had tossed some of this ash around the room, leaving white trails sprinkled across the nearby columns and frosting the floor. On the other side of this pit, facing those gathered, was a man sitting cross-legged.
Moto halted and waved his torch back and forth.
The man did not move.
“Hello!” Moto shouted, but his words echoed back without rejoinder.
The figure, robed in green and splattered in ash, sat slumped, arms folded into his robe, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible skin was his nose which peeked out from behind the fall of his black, ash splattered hair.
“Probably dead,” Seb marked.
“You think so?” said Moto dryly.
“You the one who said ‘hello’ to it.”
Pyetle made a grasping motion towards Moto, requesting the torch. Moto acquiesced. With the torchlight leading the way, Pyetle approached the mysterious figure. The rest of his men began to filter into the room, each with much less surety in their step.
“Must have living on mice,” Moto remarked as he kicked a small spine that was lying on the floor.
“Bats,” said Seb.
The scattered remains of all manner of small creatures poked out of every shadow—thin boned lizard legs, bats, birds, mice, and plenty of beetle shells too.
For a moment there, Mandri was happy to be ‘inside, because that was a state of being that he forgot existed after spending so many days wandering in the wilderness.
But this was the den of a beast.
Then Elrahet waddled in. She let her heavy robes dragged through the ash, dirt, and bones. She stepped right up to the cross-legged figure as if he were her next meal, and she poked him with her cane.
The man’s head slumped onto his shoulder and his hair fell away from his cheek.
Elrahet poked again, and he fell onto his side. The thump of his impact kicked up a cloud of ash.
“Dead,” Elrahet declared.
She rubbed the dead man’s robe between her gnarled fingers. 
“Viggy wool,” she said confidently. “The raiment of a prince. Greskal’s son.”
Pyetle spread the light of his torch onto several more pitch-strapped sticks and handed them out to his men.
“Is that who who we’ve come to hunt?” he asked.
“No,” said Elrahet. “Though he did nearly fall to the hunger. See there—”
She pointed to pointed towards a dark lump on the floor about an arm’s length behind the dead prince.
That lump had a mop of dark hair.
It had a human ear.
It had a neck, and attached to that neck were a few links of spine. What mangled flesh there was appeared to have been munched on.
Pyetle’s eyes darted between this horror and green robed prince.
“You suggest that this man ate the other?” 
Elrahet turned on him fast, and her scowl deepened. “Do not judge this boy,” she said. “He was braver than any of you. See here—”
She grabbed Pyetle’s arm and forced his torch low against the firepit.  With her cane, she poked around in the ash to reveal, buried deeply, a large stomach. Evidently the green-robed prince had cut it out at the neck and then tossed it into the fire like a lure, dragging with it his intestines, which were cut as well and tossed inside. 
Pyetle drew away in disgust.
“If he had lost his battle,” Elrahet said, “we’d have two Burshageets to hunt instead of one.”
“Burshageet?” Pyetle asked, but Elrahet was too busy rolling the stomach around in its bed of ash to clarify.
And what a sight.
The stomach’s pinkish flesh was sticky, seared in patches, and as it turned some part of it squelched and fizzled, as if it were still digesting cinders.
Elrahet pulled out her black knife.
With a quick, terrible stroke, she cut the stomach open.
She knelt down, reached in, and carefully spread the halves apart. Then she leaned over it to divine the future. Or, perhaps she sought the past.
Mandri knew very little about the art of divination. He knew only that the stomach was the seat of the Spark and that the organ was subdivided into regions, each with its own special significance—the stem, the gate, the portal vein, the sphincter, and so on. Most importantly, there were patterns in the folds of the interior lining. One could, with the right training, not only interpret the true meaning of events with those folds, but predict them altogether.
But his was not a functional knowledge.
He did not expect, after half a finger of silent staring, that he would understand anything. Then the dissected stomach squirmed and burped up a puff of black smoke that spread unnaturally quick throughout the room.
It did not take a witch to interpret this sign. All knew by way of myth what a Spark looked like when it was destroyed.
“She’s put a curse upon us!” one Skulsi shouted, his voice cracking as he backed away from the fire-pit. Half-eaten bones clattered about his feet, causing another soldier’s resolve to break entirely. He fell to his knees and muttered a warding prayer while a third man took initiative. This one lowered his spear towards Elrahet and made to thrust.
Pyetle raised his hand with the quiet gravity of someone who had stood in darker rooms than this. His voice, low and measured, snipped the budding panic at the root. “Calm yourselves,” he said, and they did.
Mandri, however, was not calmed. 
There were skeletons strewn about.
Elrahet had bewitched the air.
It would have felt good to flout these ominous things. If he’d had his breath he would have done so. He could have laughed it off, or at least he could have distracted himself by accusing the room of being too well adjusted. Instead, he was forced to listen to his own pulse be metered by Moteah’s hand. Worse, he was forced to listen to Pyetle attempt a lecture on how good discipline and a righteous cause can conquer all.
Then he noticed a faint glimmer in the dark.
He snuck his way past Elrahet, Pyetle, and the rapt crowd of soldiers. He ventured all the way back, to the back of the room, and found, hung on the wall, an enormous golden mask in the image of Solraheen.
It was a rare Old Jandri relic, though a common design, where the facial planes were obscured by sphericality. Long, decorative lines traced the contours—the cheeks, the chin, lips, and so on. Heavy lidded eyes lent His visage a look serenity. Mandri loved it even if the style was long outlawed by Hrk. Evidently it was sacrilegious to depict Solraheen’s features with such certainty. One must not claim knowledge of such things. Only the most abstract representation—a circle—would do. Even stretching that circle into an oval so as to suggest a jaw and masculinity was forbidden on pain of having to start all over again.
This mask was huge, at least two heads tall. Hrkan sacral masks could actually be worn, but this much too large. And when Hrkan masks were out of use, they were inset into a wall or ensconced within a small wood shrine, but this one hung out in the open, mounted on a bronze plate and pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.
It was a beautiful sight.
Though none of it glittered as brightly as it should.
A thin layer of dust dulled its luster. Fire-lorn ash speckled His face like freckles.
All this could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to Him. What could not be forgiven was how His golden skin was darkly mottled.
Tarnished.
Pure gold cannot tarnish. 
The Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals.
No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their doom. And worse, standing at the foot of the wall were two long-necked shooki jugs—jugs of urine. It was impossible to say for certain what this urine was for, but there was narrative proximity here which could not be ignored. Surely the Greskalun were bathing their god in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.
One indignity to wash away another.
“They should have settled for a smaller Solraheen,” a creeping soldier said, in tune with Mandri’s own thoughts.
“What’s that?” Pyetle asked from the center of the room.
“There’s a sacral mask here!” the soldier exclaimed, pointing. 
This drew the attention of several torches. Their approaching light pulled back the veil of shadow from the massive wall. Emblazoned there was a design which stirred a thrill of disbelief.
At the center of it all was the golden mask. Radiating out of it, in sharp sandstone relief, were one hundred and twenty overlapping triangles—rays of the sun. The number did not need to be counted for the pattern exactly matched the sigil of Hrk. Indeed, the only real difference between this wall and the design on Pyetle’s badge was how the rays all terminated into the mouths of worried faces. These faces were carved with such realism that Mandri actually felt repulsed; repulsed by the threat of skill, and repulsed by the uncanny sense of an alien presence stuck inside the stone.
He wanted, again, to flee.
The Hrks, meanwhile, were drawn to it.
“What is this doing here?” one gruff fellow sneered. His warted nose sniffled as he spoke, as if even the hairs inside his nostrils were stood on end.
“Why should these pokes honor us?” asked another.
“Honor?” The warted one gasped. “This is defilement! They mock us!”
“They mock Solraheen,” said yet another Skulsi man. “The impure gold is damnable work.”
“What’s the matter?” Elrahet jeered as she crouched beside the fire-pit. All but her face was obscured by her billowing robes. She looked like she’d reverted to a larval stage.
“Are you not Hrkan men?” she asked. “Will none of you bow to the sigil of your Lordship?”
The crowd of white cloaks were loathe to hear her speak, much less question them. Pyetle retained his composure, even if his round features were a little puffed by a rush of blood.
He sheathed his sword.
“I know better than to hold an old witch’s enthusiasms against her,” he said. “I won’t even ask what you meant just now.”
He then drew himself up as best he could. With such a straight back and proud chin, he could have looked down his nose at anyone. 
“I will only ask this,” he said bluntly. “Where is your giant?”
His spoke his question straight, but there was a menace in his bearing. That might have been a trick of the torch, for any face uplit by a whipping flame is unsettling.
Elrahet was unaffected. “Ayram is not here,” she said. “He is not here because he thinks this journey will fail. And it will. Your refusal to return the Mazid’s breath has sealed it.”
“Is that so?” Pyetle said through a chuckle. “And I suppose you’ll next suggest that I doomed the world. Every witch whines about the doom of the world. I’ve never believed it. I never will.” 
“Then finish it.” She said gruffly. “Be done with me and mine.”
“It may come to that. Something nearby needs killing, and that may well be you. It is to be determined. First we have to search this temple.”
“This is no temple.”
“Oh?”
“It is called Shulgi. It is a prison.”
“The demon we hunt is imprisoned here?”
Elrahet grimaced as if offended.
“Have your histories forgotten Shulgi already?” She eyed the crowd of soldiers now. Her gaze, cold and steady, made her seem like a lizard deciding to leap. “This prison was built for Solraheen.”
Pyetle cocked his head as if he hadn’t heard correctly.
“The god of all creation? Imprisoned?”
“Only for a time,” Elrahet clarified. “He did escape.”
“I would have bet that He did.”
A few Hrks laughed in agreement, but Elrahet was not amused. She stood back up with effort, aided by her cane. 
“Every mind is bound by the power of the word,” she said fervently. “Duty. Honor. Oath. These words bind you to this place as readily as Solraheen was bound by the repetition of His name. If you had heard the chant—“
“Stop with this absurdity,” Pyetle muttered.
“If you had heard His name shattered into one hundred and twenty voices, each voice entering on the finger, each new note swelling the chord until the wash of noise did shake the earth…such was the echo that one and twenty blossomed into twelve and thousands!” She lifted her eyes from the shadow of her cowl and for a moment Mandri saw a younger face beneath her wrinkling years.
“It did subdue Him” Elrahet asserted. “For an age, it stilled His being.”
“And I suppose,” Pyetle said with a sneer, “That there was a witch involved, warning everyone against this course of action?”
“None could have foreseen the what happened next.” Elrahet’s gnarled hands trembled on her cane, not from weakness now, but urgency. “The choir’s song was strong!” An unsteady frown tugged at the edge of her lips. “Then Schisol’s yearning seeped into their mouths…they were inviscerated with gold.”
“I don’t quite follow,” Pyetle said.
“Nor should you!” Elrahet snapped. “Leave this place! Do not return!”
Pyetle appeared to appreciate Elrahet’s sincerity, but in the end he smiled.
“Your insistence that I should leave only deepens my resolve.”
He then looked to his men. Apprehension and confusion crossed their faces. But he said nothing. His stillness was enough to move them.
They gathered into their squares, squeezing shoulder to shoulder so long as no unseemly corpse was in the way.
“Blank!” Pyetle called, and the only Hrk in the room not wearing a headscarf stepped forward. This man, named Blank, was flat-faced with wide-set eyes and a bald, gleaming pate, presumably his namesake. His name could have also been derived from his blank expression. He did not appear to be a thinking man. He even moved like a puppet, with strings pulled by Pyetle’s considerations.
More than this, Mandri was struck by the sense that Blank’s blocky head could not, even in principle, be painted. His chin looked strong from from the front but was rather steep and weak from the side, while his nose was practically a wall from the side but barely there from any other angle. With a skull so wide and flat, no two-dimensional account of him could be made. It gave him the impression of having been sculpted by a middling artist who refused to use a reference model. Young artists were often stubborn in that way, thinking of art as mere vehicle for their own imagination. It was the kind of mind which needed humbling. Like Pyetle’s. Indeed, constructing a man like Blank would be a small sin compared to Pyetle’s current endeavor, which was picking and choosing which of his men would die. Blank, his apparent second in command, was to help him.
Pyetle claimed they were choosing who to send to hunt down Ayram, but Mandri knew this was only a pretext—those sent out of the temple would be spared from certain death. Everyone else would venture deeper into this prison, down to its stomach perhaps, likely never to return.
Blank wanted to cull the cowardly men from their adventuring party—he pointed out the shifters, the fidgeters, the men too eager for eye contact. Curiosity, as well, was a sign of weakness. A dominant man has no need of curiosity as he knows where he stood relative to his environment.
Pyetle waved all these suggestions away.
He opted to release the men with families, as well as the men who were nearing the end of their contracts. These men were gathered and dismissed.
Once they were out of sight, Pyetle began to strut in front his twenty-odd remaining men. His pace was building up to a speech.
“Solraheen put you here,” Pyetle said proudly, pointing to the golden mask at the back of the room. “He guided you, all through your long life, so that you would be standing here. Here and now. He guided each one of you to this very challenge.” He paused to let the weight of this obligation settle on shoulders.
“You are not unlucky to be here,” he continued. “Get rid of that feeling. You are lucky. Remember that few get to meet evil with the clarity that you do now. And how will you respond? Will you charge into the dark and kill whatever festers there? I will. Are you willing to die? I am. Now is the time for it, because I will die with the luxury of knowing exactly what I’ll say to Solraheen when I meet Him.”
“What will you say?” Blank asked with excitement.
“I’ll say send me back, so that I can finish the job!”
Blank encouraged a hurrah to percolate through through the ranks, and Pyetle swept this mild feeling up by drawing his sword.
“Think of your name being nailed to the head of a demon as children parade it through the streets of Jeket!”
“Think of the women!” Blank shouted.
“The meaty women!” Pyetle repeated to a swell of heartier cheers. And with their courage half-gathered, Pyetle ran into a dark passage that was barely there in the corner of the room.
Mandri was forced to trudge along. He did not share in such excited visions of the afterlife. It was almost like they’d all completely forgotten that they’d just seen a Spark dissolve into dust.</Text>
