        <Title>Before Ixnay obo</Title>
        <Text>Halfway through that first day’s journey, Mandri’s skin started to burn and Moteah offered him some kell oil. He dropped everything and slathered himself up with the sticky red stuff—he covered his hands, his face, the back of the neck. Obo reminded him to get the backs of his ears as well. Moteah told him to keep it away from the shallow of the eye, as kell oil stings the eyes.
Now Mandri was as red as the rest of them. He figured in a year, if he lived that long, he’d be indistinguishable from any other outland poke.</Text>
