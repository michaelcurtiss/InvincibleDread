        <Title>Old Goree Ending</Title>
        <Text>The creation and the curse of the Goree Pass is a simple story. An ancient tribe, called the Solgruin, asked Solraheen to split the Goree mountains so that their overland journey east would be made easier. Solraheen denied them, for He did not want to destroy any part of His creation just to accommodate trade. But the Solgruin asked again, and again, and on the fourth asking, Solraheen lost His patience. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there He stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
The curse he spoke was heard by every ear in all the world.
“Look upon this scar which mars My creation and hate your selfish ways. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, but so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
Mandri loved this story. It was one of his favorites. Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin, and Mandri used it as justification to rip up a painting to spite a client. 
He’d only ever done it once, but what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a month and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the barbarian King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would walk through her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a barbaric outland King on a richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, “That looks just like your Pookum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Pookum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with a righteous fury, as that unfamiliar euphoria motivated him to tear the painting completely in half, which he did, and he did it right in front of that cursed woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have killed that woman, just as Solraheen killed those who journeyed the Goree Pass. Well, Solraheen didn’t kill them exactly, He cursed them.
Curses, it turns out, can be avoided through sheer reason. Solraheen said, “Cursed are you who pass through it,” and it was argued that He meant the ‘you’ to be a restrictive ‘you’ which refers only to the Solgruin. Everyone else could pass through fine, and pass through they did. After all, here was Mandri and the Ayramun, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the Pass. And people lived in the Pass, most notably the Greskalun, led by Greskal, an old Jandri tribe whose charge was to keep the pass free from anyone who had a single drop of Solgruin blood.
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, and further out was the black rock sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib from spreading out of control. 
The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen’s spite became, for the ground under Mandri’s feet grew uneven, and rocks popped up like roots to trip him. The Goree’s walls grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground. An eon of blasting sand rounded the edges of these cracks, pillowed the seams, giving the rock the appearance of being bloated with infection. Mandri’s mood dimmed at the sight of them—it was quite apparent that the place was cursed. 
Soon the Goree Pass was sighted in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree’s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Obo informed Mandri that this splinter was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the breadth of the Pass’s mouth, protecting against ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now, and had done so for centuries.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through a debris field from a mountain cleft exploding.
The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been impossible to believe if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Solraheen standing up there on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the dusty wind. A god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe to set the mountains quaking, bursting, and out would come a torrent of stones the size of houses. In the blink of an eye, a long sliver of the mountain would be reduced to rubble.
The Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram walked with a bowed head, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his giant pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, like his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—brooding and quiet.
Seb was chewing her borcandi spines so hard that her jaw was going stiff and she had to sort of rub the spines between her stubby teeth instead of chew. And the woman wasn’t paying attention to where she was spitting his juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, she hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted herself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Don’t disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me disrespect you?”
“You threaten a woman with her kneecaps, that’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“It was an accident.”
“And I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He doubled back to make sure that he was listened to. “Nobody talks from here on out. Nobody except me.”
Mandri asked, “Why? Did you see someone?”
“I said nobody talks.”
Ayram’s deep voice rumbled Mandri to his core. Obo was not so affected. He added, from behind Mandri’s ear, “The Hrks will be on us today.”
Ayram’s eyes went wide. “You can sense the Hrks?”
“I can,” said Obo, “But the Hrks aren’t who you should be worried about. It’s the Greskalun. Something’s happened to them.”
Seb groaned. “Can we gag the damn thing up?”
Ayram’s grave visage lingered on Obo a moment, unsure of how much he could trust the Mazid. Then he set off again towards the Pass, this time more cautiously, more careful to crouch and hide his bulk behind boulders.
By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. This once living mountain was dead and rotted through. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock, for they were as friable as the hardtack Mandri was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased—when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against the mountain’s foot, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the mountain were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread.
Then there was the black tower that poked out of the Pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower. And no bright Spark ever builds in black, though Mandri admitted that the tower’s blackness lent it monumental significance. So it was fitting, in a way, as the central task of a monument is to look like it doesn’t belong. The tall spike sticking out of the Pass did this quite comfortably. It marked a curse which did not belong.
Mandri feared he’d die on the approach, for the brittle rock above threatened to come galloping down upon him every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks as Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by their invisible Hrkan pursuit. He pioneered a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo without seeing him, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered for making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof that Obo was wrong about the Hrks, and that he was wrong about ‘something happening’ to the Greskalun. 
Then the Goree pass opened up before them.
The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle of the narrow pass. Stubby black stone walls filled the short gaps on either side of it. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s gate at its base, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that Obo was right—something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off towards the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb broke the rule of silence with a whisper. “Maybe they all retreated, went back to their temple.” Seb was so stressed out that she was chewing two spines at once and her words were garbled by a slosh of spit.
“Retreated from what?” Moteah asked.
“Don’t ask me,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Mandri.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “That could be! Happened before. That’s what pokes do when the pox gets on them, they run away then stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.” 
“I don’t think we should go in,” Mandri said, though he knew his opinion didn’t matter. He received several annoyed glares for his trouble. “It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since forever.”
“It is not cursed,” said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows. But as soon as he said the words, a black vulture appeared to melt out of the the tower’s pointed roof. It squawked fiercely as it took flight.
“It’s only a bird,” Ayram muttered as they all watched the bird spread its long wings and ride a thermal high up into the air, where it wheeled around in circles.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and soared up to join their brother’s holding pattern. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient curse.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Ayram, “Then the Hrks would have all choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The giant tried to maintain his stoic frown, but Mandri could see that the mood was affecting even him, which was perfectly understandable, for the strongest men have the most to lose from a curse, and a curse was not something they could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion that everything was going according to plan.
Ayram marched over to Mandri, and Mandri flinched, fearing that Ayram had somehow heard his thoughts.
“Take off your pack,” Ayram grumbled.
Mandri obediently swung Obo’s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it, set it down, and he squatted next to it so he could get a clear look at Obo’s face, or maybe it was so Obo could get a clear look at his—the man looked ready to kill.
“Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?” he asked. There was no room in his tone for games.
“No,” said Obo, as if the question were a bore. “You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. I know you outland pokes abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when—”
“The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.”
Obo set his sight on the tower itself. This was the first time he’d seen it, as he’d been stuck on Mandri’s back up until now. His face betrayed nothing.
He said, “If you are asking me if there’s an army of Hrkan Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. However, I do think your instincts are correct—what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter.”
Seb spat at Obo, and the loogie just missed his shoulder and splatted harmlessly against a rock. “Them Greskalun could be here. Pox, Hrks, drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” said Moteah, doubtfully.
Obo rolled his eyes at both women, and instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter. His elbows stretched his swaddling robe as he twisted around. Mandri couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight of it—Obo looked like a toddler trying to roll over, trying to get comfortable for a nap. With effort, Obo poked his right hand up out of the neck of his tightly wrapped robe, and he used it to widen the opening so that he could stick his whole pale arm through. Once done, he reached out behind him and grabbed a bone that was half buried in the dirt.
“Interesting bone, isn’t it?” he said. “I’m surprised it escaped your notice.”
Obo set the bone out before him, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.
“This is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.”
Seb stomped over and nudged it with her toe. “You find one bone and you think them dead? One bone in the ground? A bone in the ground ain’t unusual. Where else you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Let the Mazid speak,” said Ayram.
Obo nudged the bone so that it flipped over.
“This is an unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
He stroked the length of the bone’s fracture with a thin, white finger. It was a jagged fracture which stretched almost along the whole length of the bone, leaving the upturned half looking like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unfazed.
“Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that would be expected, because that’s how bones naturally break. A break like this—it’s not likely to happen accidentally.”
Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “So you say this person was killed? That’s not unusual.”
Mandri blurted out, “I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the Pass.”
“We’re not in the Pass.”
Obo said, “Whoever it was, however they died, that is not significant. What is significant, is that a blow to the leg would not crack the bone lengthwise like that. It could happen, but the chances of it occurring are exceedingly slim.”
“Get on with it,” Ayram grumbled.
“I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri ruin. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating each other. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone up so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside. Lizards cant do this. Neither can dogs. They don’t have the hands for it.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with images of some grungy, sand-crusted cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his filed teeth.
Ayram held the bone out away from him as if it were diseased.
Elrahet waddled over and yanked the bone from the his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the open socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone into Obo’s stumpy lap, and as it fell, Mandri’s mind ran fresh with fear, for Obo hadn’t mentioned the most likely cause—yes, it couldn’t have been lizards or dogs because they didn’t have dexterous hands, but some demons do.
The demon that almost pulled him under the earth certainly did.
“Look!” Moteah shouted, forgetting the necessity of quiet.
She was pointing towards the tower’s gate, out of which Moto was sprinting. He sprinted at full speed, frenetic, as if being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust down there in the mouth of the Pass.
When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!” He looked over his shoulder and grimaced.
“Pick up the Mazid,” Ayram said to Mandri, and with that it was decided—Ayram would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower and its gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled, and bulging ever so slightly outward. Most of its bricks were chipped, some were twisted, some seemed to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The gate underneath was just as ominous, it was ten-men wide and its arch was fanged by metal teeth which would have scratched Ayram’s head if he did not duck. The gate tunnel was as long as the hall of a Hrkan Lord, cavernous enough to turn the thump of Ayram’s walking spear into an echoing beat. Aside from this steady meter, they passed through the dark in silence, casting wary glances at the empty door frames that pocketed either side.
Moto, who’d taken the lead, stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and the shadow of shadows passed over his face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it, and all around, stuck into the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were large wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
It was a desecration.
Such was the defilement that panic leapt into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. But he was rooted to the spot, for the horror robbed him of every faculty, and it set his stomach roiling in a terrible, growling fit.
The nearest wretch was only ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant pilgrim. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, lolled in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of Sol.
They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His broken scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor pilgrims littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.
Obo, with the use of his newly freed arm, hauled himself up onto Mandri’s shoulder to see for himself.
Mandri muttered, “What is this?”, and for once, Obo had no answer.
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Seb, a woman who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil scene halfway through tunnel, for she had not made it out into the courtyard. She was standing inside in the tunnel’s shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep as if her belly ached.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye towards his mournful band. He said, “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, even Hrkan pilgrims, but I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into her skin, and she said in turn, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? Sides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em ‘cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’.”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as she gestured at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them. “Moteah’s right.”
The stern assertion stunned them all back into silence, and Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the tunnel after the witch.
Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up as straight as her back allowed.
“Must have been the panic,” she said as she walked towards the courtyard. It seemed all her joints were aching, like every weary moment of the long journey was suddenly set upon her.
“Mere hate, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets a stomach growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light and surveyed the courtyard with a spiteful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? You have sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I don’t know what you—”
“PANIC!” Elrahet shrieked. “Panic sets its stomach growling. Panic wakes it up.”
“Wakes what up?” Mandri asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled.
“The Amalgamete.”
The graveled word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a rock aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“Was the Amalgamete that did this,” the witch declared. “A man who became the Amalgamete.”
Ayram, still composed, said, “We’ll do what we can for them, then we leave.”
“Nothing we can do can help these grim pilgrims.”
Seb spat her agreement onto the courtyard brick and said flatly, “Dead is dead.”
“They are not dead,” said Elrahet, sneering.
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim. He’d seen enough of death to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive.
On second glance the pilgrim’s wounds were quite peculiar. The strip of missing skin on the outside of his thigh was circumscribed by white-pink rings of fresh skin.
Fresh skin…
Still growing…
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered. Mandri sprang back just as the man’s ruined head jerked up, tossing a spill of blood at Mandri’s feet. The pilgrim’s tongue twisted out of his yawning mouth as he tried in vain to grasp a wet breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs. He wheezed and gulped, and his chest heaved against the rope of thorns, but in the end his eyes rolled back and his whole body went limp and quiet.
“His very Spark is bound to the pole,” Elrahet explained. She seemed unable to look upon the pilgrim. “He will die, and die, and die again.” Her bottom lip quivered, and she seemed about about to explode in rage, then she then stamped her cane into the ground and proclaimed, “This is not safe! We must leave at once!”
She turned hobbled back into the tunnel.
Moto was the first to follow. Then Ayram and Moteah. Mandri joined them in the shadow of the tower and was glad to be gone from that courtyard.
Seb remained.
“Hold on,” she said, indignant. “We’re goin’ back!? What about the Greskalun?” She jabbed an open hand towards the dark rent in the mountains behind, as if the Greskalun were right there and the others only had to squint a little to see them.
“There are no Greskalun,” Moteah said again.
But Seb stood her ground. “You can’t know that ‘til we go and have a look! We at least got to look!”
“That Pass is cursed!” Moto exclaimed, but Seb merely crossed her arms and argued, “Can’t be worse than Hrks.” And has her hip settled into a frustrated cant, there came from the desert a sharp and roaring bleat—the Hrkan horn of war.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommm

The call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and all eyes raced westward, for there in the distance was a horse and rider, galloping around from the sprawling tumble of the Goree’s shattered stones.
The horse, white as bone, came stumbling to a stop and reared up almost to the point of no control. The rider, little more than a speck so far away, was a man as dark as Moto and clad in the familiar blue robe of a Hrkan scribe. He shouted a command to his beast to settle it down, and all the while his head was trained on the tunnel where the Ayramun stood.
Behind him, from around the bend, came a double-column of Hrkan Skulsi.
Shuffling along in front them was a black-robed Mazidariga.
“RUN!” Ayram roared. 
Mandri needed no prodding. He turned and ran through the accursed courtyard, and he was soon outpaced by everyone but Ayram. Just as he began to wonder what Ayram was up to, there came the giant galloping by with Elrahet clinging to his pack like a spider.</Text>

        <Title>OBO ZOOPED</Title>
        <Text>The creation and the curse of the Goree Pass is a simple story. An ancient tribe, called the Solgruin, asked Solraheen to split the Goree mountains so that their overland journey east would be made easier. Solraheen denied them, for He did not want to destroy any part of His creation just to accommodate trade. But the Solgruin asked again, and again, and on the fourth asking, Solraheen lost His patience. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there He stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
The curse he spoke was heard by every ear in all the world.
“Look upon this scar which mars My creation and hate your selfish ways. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, but so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
Mandri loved this story. It was one of his favorites. Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin, and Mandri used it as justification to rip up a painting to spite a client. 
He’d only ever done it once, but what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a month and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the barbarian King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would walk through her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a barbaric outland King on a richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, “That looks just like your Pookum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Pookum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with a righteous fury, as that unfamiliar euphoria motivated him to tear the painting completely in half, which he did, and he did it right in front of that cursed woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have killed that woman, just as Solraheen killed those who journeyed the Goree Pass. Well, Solraheen didn’t kill them exactly, He cursed them.
Curses, it turns out, can be avoided through sheer reason. Solraheen said, “Cursed are you who pass through it,” and it was argued that He meant the ‘you’ to be a restrictive ‘you’ which refers only to the Solgruin. Everyone else could pass through fine, and pass through they did. After all, here was Mandri and the Ayramun, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the Pass. And people lived in the Pass, most notably the Greskalun, led by Greskal, an old Jandri tribe whose charge was to keep the pass free from anyone who had a single drop of Solgruin blood.
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, and further out was the black rock sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib from spreading out of control. 
The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen’s spite became, for the ground under Mandri’s feet grew uneven, and rocks popped up like roots to trip him. The Goree’s walls grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground. An eon of blasting sand rounded the edges of these cracks, pillowed the seams, giving the rock the appearance of being bloated with infection. Mandri’s mood dimmed at the sight of them—it was quite apparent that the place was cursed. 
Soon the Goree Pass was sighted in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree’s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Obo informed Mandri that this splinter was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the breadth of the Pass’s mouth, protecting against ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now, and had done so for centuries.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through a debris field from a mountain cleft exploding.
The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been impossible to believe if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Solraheen standing up on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the dusty wind. A god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe to set the mountains quaking, bursting, and out would come a torrent of stones the size of houses. In the blink of an eye, a long sliver of the mountain would be reduced to rubble.
The Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram walked with a bowed head, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his giant pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, as if his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—brooding and quiet.
Seb had been chewing her borcandi spines so hard that her jaw was going stiff and she had to sort of rub the spines between her stubby teeth instead of chew. And the woman wasn’t paying attention to where she was spitting her juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, she hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted herself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Don’t disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me disrespect you?”
“You threaten a woman with her kneecaps, that’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“It was an accident.”
“And I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He was so irritated with the two of them that he doubled back. “Nobody talks from here on out. Nobody except me.”
Mandri asked, “Why? Is something wrong?”
“I said nobody talks.”
Ayram’s deep voice rumbled Mandri to his core. Obo was not so affected. He added, from behind Mandri’s ear, “The Hrks will be on us today.”
Ayram’s eyes went wide. “You can sense the Hrks?”
“I can,” said Obo, “But the Hrks aren’t who you should be worried about. It’s the Greskalun. Something’s happened to them.”
Seb groaned. “Can we gag the damn thing up?”
Ayram’s grave visage lingered on Obo a moment, unsure of how much he could trust the Mazid. Then he set off again towards the Pass, this time more cautiously, more careful to crouch and hide his bulk behind boulders.
By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. This once living mountain was dead and rotted through. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock, for they were as friable as the hardtack Mandri was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased—when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against the mountain’s foot, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the mountain were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread.
Then there was the black tower that poked out of the Pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower. And no bright Spark ever builds in black, though Mandri admitted that the tower’s blackness lent it monumental significance. So it was fitting, in a way, as the central task of a monument is to look like it doesn’t belong. The tall spike sticking out of the Pass did this quite comfortably. It marked a curse which did not belong.
Mandri feared he’d die on the approach, for the brittle rock above threatened to come galloping down upon him every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks as Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by the apparently invisible Hrkan pursuit. He pioneered a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo using a Mazidariga, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered for making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof that Obo was wrong about the Hrks, and that he was wrong about ‘something happening’ to the Greskalun. 
Then the Goree pass opened up before them.
The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle of the narrow pass. Stubby black stone walls filled the short gaps on either side of it. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s gate at its base, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that Obo was right—something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off towards the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb broke the rule of silence with a whisper. “Maybe they all retreated, went back to their temple.” Seb was so stressed out that she was chewing two spines at once and her words were garbled by a slosh of spit.
“Retreated from what?” Moteah asked.
“Don’t ask me,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Mandri.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “That could be! Happened before. That’s what pokes do when the pox gets on them, they run away then stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.” 
“I don’t think we should go in,” Mandri said, though he knew his opinion didn’t matter. He received several glares for his trouble. “It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since forever.”
“It is not cursed,” said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows. But as soon as he said the words, a black vulture appeared to melt out of the tower’s pointed roof. It hissed as it took flight.
“It’s only a bird,” Ayram muttered as they all watched the bird spread its long wings and ride a thermal high up into the air, where it wheeled in circles.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and soared up to join their brother’s holding pattern. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient curse.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Ayram, “Then the Hrks would have all choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The giant tried to maintain his stoic frown, but Mandri could see that the mood was affecting even him, which was perfectly understandable, for the strongest men have the most to lose from a curse, and a curse was not something they could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion that everything was going according to plan.
Ayram marched over to Mandri, and Mandri flinched, fearing that Ayram had somehow heard his thoughts.
“Take off your pack,” Ayram grumbled.
Mandri obediently swung Obo’s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it, set it down, and he squatted next to it so he could get a clear look at Obo’s face, or maybe it was so Obo could get a clear look at his—the man looked ready to kill.
“Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?” he asked. There was no room in his tone for games.
“No,” said Obo, as if the question were a bore. “You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. I know you outland pokes abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when—”
“The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.”
Obo set his sight on the tower itself. This was the first time he’d seen it, as he’d been stuck on Mandri’s back up until now. His face betrayed nothing.
He said, “If you are asking me if there’s an army of Hrkan Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. However, I do think your instincts are correct—what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter.”
Seb spat at Obo, and the loogie just missed his shoulder and splatted harmlessly against a rock. “Them Greskalun could be here. Pox, Hrks, drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” said Moteah, doubtfully.
Obo rolled his eyes at both women, and instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter. His elbows stretched his swaddling robe as he twisted around. Mandri couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight of it—Obo looked like a toddler trying to roll over, trying to get comfortable for a nap. With effort, Obo poked his right hand up out of the neck of his tightly wrapped robe, and he used it to widen the opening so that he could stick his whole pale arm through. Once done, he reached out behind him and grabbed a bone that was half buried in the dirt.
“Interesting bone, isn’t it?” he said. “I’m surprised it escaped your notice.”
Obo set the bone out before him, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.
“This is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.”
Seb stomped over and nudged it with her toe. “You find one bone and you think them dead? One bone in the ground? A bone in the ground ain’t unusual. Where else you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Let the Mazid speak,” said Ayram.
Obo nudged the bone so that it flipped over.
“This is an unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
He stroked the length of the bone’s fracture with a thin, white finger. It was a jagged fracture which stretched almost along the whole length of the bone, leaving the upturned half looking like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unfazed.
“Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that would be expected, because that’s how bones naturally break. A break like this—it’s not likely to happen accidentally.”
Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “So you say this person was killed? That’s not unusual.”
Mandri blurted out, “I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the Pass.”
“We’re not in the Pass.”
Obo said, “Whoever it was, however they died, that is not significant. What is significant, is that a blow to the leg would not crack the bone lengthwise like that. It could happen, but the chances of it occurring are exceedingly slim.”
“Get on with it,” Ayram grumbled.
“I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri ruin. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating each other. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone up so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside. Lizards can’t do this. Neither can dogs. They don’t have the hands for it.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with images of some grungy, sand-crusted cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his filed teeth.
Ayram held the bone out away from him as if it were diseased.
Elrahet waddled over and yanked the bone from his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the open socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone into Obo’s stumpy lap, and as it fell, Moteah shouted, “Look!”
She was pointing towards the tower’s gate, out of which Moto was sprinting. He sprinted at full speed, frenetic, as if being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust down there in the mouth of the Pass.
When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!” He looked over his shoulder and grimaced.
“Pick up the Mazid,” Ayram said to Mandri, and with that it was decided—Ayram would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower and its gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled, and bulging ever so slightly outward. Most of its bricks were chipped, some were twisted, some seemed to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The gate underneath was just as ominous, it was ten-men wide and its arch was fanged by metal teeth which would have scratched Ayram’s head if he did not duck. The gate tunnel was as long as the hall of a Hrkan Lord, cavernous enough to turn the thump of Ayram’s walking spear into an echoing beat. Aside from this steady meter, they passed through the dark in silence, casting wary glances at the empty door frames that pocketed either side.
Moto, who’d taken the lead, stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and the shadow of shadows passed over his face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it, and all around, stuck into the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were large wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
It was a desecration.
Such was the defilement that panic leapt into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. But he was rooted to the spot, for the horror robbed him of every faculty, and it set his stomach roiling in a terrible, growling fit.
The nearest wretch was only ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant pilgrim. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, lolled in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of Sol.
They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His broken scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor pilgrims littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.
Obo, with the use of his newly freed arm, hauled himself up onto Mandri’s shoulder to see for himself.
Mandri muttered, “What is this?” and for once, Obo had no answer.
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Seb, a woman who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil scene halfway through the tunnel, for she had not made it out into the courtyard. She was standing inside in the tunnel’s shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep as if her belly ached.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye towards his mournful band. He said, “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, even Hrkan pilgrims, but I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into her skin, and she said in turn, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? Sides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em ‘cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’.”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as she gestured at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them. “Moteah’s right.”
The stern assertion stunned them all back into silence, and Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the tunnel after the witch.
Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up as straight as her back allowed.
“Must have been the panic,” she said as she walked towards the courtyard. It seemed all her joints were aching, like every weary moment of the long journey was suddenly set upon her.
“Mere hate, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets a stomach growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light and surveyed the courtyard with a spiteful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? You have sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I don’t know what you—”
“PANIC!” Elrahet shrieked. “Panic sets its stomach growling. Panic wakes it up.”
“Wakes what up?” Mandri asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled.
“The Amalgamete.”
The graveled word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a rock aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“Was the Amalgamete that did this,” the witch declared. “A man who became the Amalgamete.”
Ayram, still composed, said, “We’ll do what we can for them, then we leave.”
“Nothing we can do can help these grim pilgrims.”
Seb spat her agreement onto the courtyard brick and said flatly, “Dead is dead.”
“They are not dead,” said Elrahet, sneering.
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim. He’d seen enough of death to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive.
On second glance the pilgrim’s wounds were quite peculiar. The strip of missing skin on the outside of his thigh was circumscribed by white-pink rings of fresh skin.
Fresh skin…
Still growing…
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered. Mandri sprang back just as the man’s ruined head jerked up, tossing a spill of blood at Mandri’s feet. The pilgrim’s tongue twisted out of his yawning mouth as he tried in vain to grasp a wet breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs. He wheezed and gulped, and his chest heaved against the rope of thorns, but in the end his eyes rolled back and his whole body went limp and quiet.
“His very Spark is bound to the pole,” Elrahet explained. She seemed unable to look upon the pilgrim. “He will die, and die, and die again.” Her bottom lip quivered, and she seemed about to explode in rage, then she then stamped her cane into the ground and proclaimed, “This is not safe! We must leave at once!”
She hobbled back into the tunnel.
Moto was the first to follow. Then Ayram and Moteah. Mandri joined them in the shadow of the tower and was glad to be gone from that courtyard.
Seb remained.
“Hold on,” she said, indignant. “We’re goin’ back!? What about the Greskalun?” She jabbed an open hand towards the dark rent in the mountains behind, as if the Greskalun were right there and the others only had to squint a little to see them.
“There are no Greskalun,” Moteah said again.
But Seb stood her ground. “You can’t know that ‘til we go and have a look! We at least got to look!”
“That Pass is cursed!” Moto exclaimed, but Seb merely crossed her arms and argued, “Can’t be worse than Hrks.” And as her hip settled into a know-it-all’s tilt, there came from the desert a sharp and roaring bleat—the Hrkan horn of war.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommm

The call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and all eyes raced westward, for there in the distance was a speck of man set against the glare of the desert. All that could be made of him were the familiar blue robes of a Hrkan scribe. At his side was a shorter figure wrapped in black, a Mazidariga, and behind them, from around the sprawling tumble of the Goree’s shattered stones, was a double-column of white robed soldiers marching in even squares.
“RUN!” Ayram roared, and if that wasn’t enough to prod Mandri into motion, the Mazidariga’s warbling whistle split the air, sending Obo into convulsions inside his litter. 
Mandri turned and ran through the accursed courtyard, weaving a route around the pilgrim poles and up the courtyard slope. He did not slow down until the whistling died and Obo stopped squirming in his litter.
“You still there?” he asked, fearing that Obo’s pseudospark had been stolen, but he was relieved to hear the Mazid’s exasperated voice spring from behind his ear, “The Riga’s range is fixed, keep running!”
Mandri kept running. He was soon outpaced by everyone but Ayram, and then at last the giant came galloping by with Elrahet clinging to his pack like a spider. 
“Hurry!” she screeched, and she climbed over Ayram’s pack to ride his shoulders. Ayram then took his place at the head of their file, and led them running into the dark heart of the Pass</Text>

        <Title>Before Ixnay Obo</Title>
        <Text>The creation and the curse of the Goree Pass is a simple story. An ancient tribe, called the Solgruin, asked Solraheen to split the Goree mountains so that their overland journey east would be made easier. Solraheen denied them, for He did not want to destroy any part of His creation just to accommodate trade. But the Solgruin asked again, and again, and on the fourth asking, Solraheen lost His patience. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there He stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
The curse he spoke was heard by every ear in all the world.
“Look upon this scar which mars My creation and hate your selfish ways. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, but so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
Mandri loved this story. It was one of his favorites. Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin, and Mandri used it as justification to rip up a painting to spite a client. 
He’d only ever done it once, but what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a month and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the barbarian King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would walk through her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a barbaric outland King on a richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, “That looks just like your Pookum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Pookum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with a righteous fury, as that unfamiliar euphoria motivated him to tear the painting completely in half, which he did, and he did it right in front of that cursed woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have killed that woman, just as Solraheen killed those who journeyed the Goree Pass. Well, Solraheen didn’t kill them exactly, He cursed them.
Curses, it turns out, can be avoided through sheer reason. Solraheen said, “Cursed are you who pass through it,” and it was argued that He meant the ‘you’ to be a restrictive ‘you’ which refers only to the Solgruin. Everyone else could pass through fine, and pass through they did. After all, here was Mandri and the Ayramun, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the Pass. And people lived in the Pass, most notably the Greskalun, led by Greskal, an old Jandri tribe whose charge was to keep the pass free from anyone who had a single drop of Solgruin blood.
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, and further out was the black rock sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib from spreading out of control. 
The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen’s spite became, for the ground under Mandri’s feet grew uneven, and rocks popped up like roots to trip him. The Goree’s walls grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground. An eon of blasting sand rounded the edges of these cracks, pillowed the seams, giving the rock the appearance of being bloated with infection. Mandri’s mood dimmed at the sight of them—it was quite apparent that the place was cursed. 
Soon the Goree Pass was sighted in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree’s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Obo informed Mandri that this splinter was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the breadth of the Pass’s mouth, protecting against ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now, and had done so for centuries.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through a debris field from a mountain cleft exploding.
The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been impossible to believe if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Solraheen standing up on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the dusty wind. A god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe to set the mountains quaking, bursting, and out would come a torrent of stones the size of houses. In the blink of an eye, a long sliver of the mountain would be reduced to rubble.
The Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram walked with a bowed head, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his giant pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, as if his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—brooding and quiet.
Mandri was marching behind Seb, who was chewing her borcandi spines so hard that her jaw was going stiff. She had to sort of rub the spines between her stubby teeth instead of chew. And the woman wasn’t paying attention to where she was spitting her juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, she hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel above her.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted herself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Don’t disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me disrespect you?”
“You threaten a woman with her kneecaps, that’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“It was an accident.”
“And I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He was so irritated with the two of them that he doubled back. “Nobody talks from here on out. Nobody except me.”
Mandri asked, “Why? Is something wrong?”
“I said nobody talks.”
Ayram’s deep voice rumbled Mandri to his core. Obo was not so affected. He added, from behind Mandri’s ear, “The Hrks will be on us today.”
Ayram’s eyes went wide. “You can sense the Hrks?”
“I can,” said Obo, “But the Hrks aren’t who you should be worried about. It’s the Greskalun. Something’s happened to them.”
Seb groaned. “Can we gag the damn thing up?”
Ayram’s grave visage lingered on Obo a moment, unsure of how much he could trust the Mazid. Then he set off again towards the Pass, this time more cautiously, more careful to crouch and hide his bulk behind boulders.
By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. This once living mountain was dead and rotted through. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock, for they were as friable as the hardtack Mandri was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased—when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against the mountain’s foot, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the mountain were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread.
Then there was the black tower that poked out of the Pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower. And no bright Spark ever builds in black, though Mandri admitted that the tower’s blackness lent it monumental significance. So it was fitting, in a way, as the central task of a monument is to look like it doesn’t belong. The tall spike sticking out of the Pass did this quite comfortably. It marked a curse which did not belong.
Mandri feared he’d die on the approach, for the brittle rock above threatened to come galloping down upon him every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks as Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by the apparently invisible Hrkan pursuit. He pioneered a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo using a Mazidariga, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered for making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof that Obo was wrong about the Hrks, and that he was wrong about ‘something happening’ to the Greskalun. 
Then the Goree pass opened up before them.
The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle of the narrow pass. Stubby black stone walls filled the short gaps on either side of it. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s gate at its base, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that Obo was right—something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off towards the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb broke the rule of silence with a whisper. “Maybe they all retreated, went back to their temple.” Seb was so stressed out that she was chewing two spines at once and her words were garbled by a slosh of spit.
“Retreated from what?” Moteah asked.
“Don’t ask me,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Mandri.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “That could be! Happened before. That’s what pokes do when the pox gets on them, they run away then stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.” 
“I don’t think we should go in,” Mandri said, though he knew his opinion didn’t matter. He received several glares for his trouble. “It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since forever.”
“It is not cursed,” said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows. But as soon as he said the words, a black vulture appeared to melt out of the tower’s pointed roof. It hissed as it took flight.
“It’s only a bird,” Ayram muttered as they all watched the bird spread its long wings and ride a thermal high up into the air, where it wheeled in circles.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and soared up to join their brother’s holding pattern. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient curse.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Ayram, “Then the Hrks would have all choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The giant tried to maintain his stoic frown, but Mandri could see that the mood was affecting even him, which was perfectly understandable, for the strongest men have the most to lose from a curse, and a curse was not something they could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion that everything was going according to plan.
Ayram marched over to Mandri, and Mandri flinched, fearing that Ayram had somehow heard his thoughts.
“Take off your pack,” Ayram grumbled.
Mandri obediently swung Obo’s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it, set it down, and he squatted next to it so he could get a clear look at Obo’s face, or maybe it was so Obo could get a clear look at his—the man looked ready to kill.
“Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?” he asked. There was no room in his tone for games.
“No,” said Obo, as if the question were a bore. “You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. I know you outland pokes abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when—”
“The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.”
Obo set his sight on the tower itself. This was the first time he’d seen it, as he’d been stuck on Mandri’s back up until now. His face betrayed nothing.
He said, “If you are asking me if there’s an army of Hrkan Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. However, I do think your instincts are correct—what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter.”
Seb spat at Obo, and the loogie just missed his shoulder and splatted harmlessly against a rock. “Them Greskalun could be here. Pox, Hrks, drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” said Moteah, doubtfully.
Obo rolled his eyes at both women, and instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter. His elbows stretched his swaddling robe as he twisted around. Mandri couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight of it—Obo looked like a toddler trying to roll over, trying to get comfortable for a nap. With effort, Obo poked his right hand up out of the neck of his tightly wrapped robe, and he used it to widen the opening so that he could stick his whole pale arm through. Once done, he reached out behind him and grabbed a bone that was half buried in the dirt.
“Interesting bone, isn’t it?” he said. “I’m surprised it escaped your notice.”
Obo set the bone out before him, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.
“This is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.”
Seb stomped over and nudged it with her toe. “You find one bone and you think them dead? One bone in the ground? A bone in the ground ain’t unusual. Where else you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Let the Mazid speak,” said Ayram.
Obo nudged the bone so that it flipped over.
“This is an unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
He stroked the length of the bone’s fracture with a thin, white finger. It was a jagged fracture which stretched almost along the whole length of the bone, leaving the upturned half looking like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unfazed.
“Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that would be expected, because that’s how bones naturally break. A break like this—it’s not likely to happen accidentally.”
Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. He said, “So you say this person was killed? That’s not unusual.”
Mandri blurted out, “I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the Pass.”
“We’re not in the Pass.”
Obo said, “Whoever it was, however they died, that is not significant. What is significant, is that a blow to the leg would not crack the bone lengthwise like that. It could happen, but the chances of it occurring are exceedingly slim.”
“Get on with it,” Ayram grumbled.
“I’ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri ruin. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating each other. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone up so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside. Lizards can’t do this. Neither can dogs. They don’t have the hands for it.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with images of some grungy, sand-crusted cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his filed teeth.
Ayram held the bone out away from him as if it were diseased.
Elrahet waddled over and yanked the bone from his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the open socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone into Obo’s stumpy lap, and as it fell, Moteah shouted, “Look!”
She was pointing towards the tower’s gate, out of which Moto was sprinting. He sprinted at full speed, frenetic, as if being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust down there in the mouth of the Pass.
When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!” He looked over his shoulder and grimaced.
“Pick up the Mazid,” Ayram said to Mandri, and with that it was decided—Ayram would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower and its gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled, and bulging ever so slightly outward. Most of its bricks were chipped, some were twisted, some seemed to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The gate underneath was just as ominous, it was ten-men wide and its arch was fanged by metal teeth which would have scratched Ayram’s head if he did not duck. The gate tunnel was as long as the hall of a Hrkan Lord, cavernous enough to turn the thump of Ayram’s walking spear into an echoing beat. Aside from this steady meter, they passed through the dark in silence, casting wary glances at the empty door frames that pocketed either side.
Moto, who’d taken the lead, stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and the shadow of shadows passed over his face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it, and all around, stuck into the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were large wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
It was a desecration.
Such was the defilement that panic leapt into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. But he was rooted to the spot, for the horror robbed him of every faculty, and it set his stomach roiling in a terrible, growling fit.
The nearest wretch was only ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant pilgrim. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, lolled in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of Sol.
They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His broken scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor pilgrims littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.
Obo, with the use of his newly freed arm, hauled himself up onto Mandri’s shoulder to see for himself.
Mandri muttered, “What is this?” and for once, Obo had no answer.
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Seb, a woman who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil scene halfway through the tunnel, for she had not made it out into the courtyard. She was standing inside in the tunnel’s shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep as if her belly ached.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye towards his mournful band. He said, “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, even Hrkan pilgrims, but I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into her skin, and she said in turn, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? Sides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em ‘cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’.”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as she gestured at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them. “Moteah’s right.”
The stern assertion stunned them all back into silence, and Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the tunnel after the witch.
Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up as straight as her back allowed.
“Must have been the panic,” she said as she walked towards the courtyard. It seemed all her joints were aching, like every weary moment of the long journey was suddenly set upon her.
“Mere hate, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets a stomach growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light and surveyed the courtyard with a spiteful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? You have sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I don’t know what you—”
“PANIC!” Elrahet shrieked. “Panic sets its stomach growling. Panic wakes it up.”
“Wakes what up?” Mandri asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled.
“The Amalgamete.”
The graveled word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a rock aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“Was the Amalgamete that did this,” the witch declared. “A man who became the Amalgamete.”
Ayram, still composed, said, “We’ll do what we can for them, then we leave.”
“Nothing we can do can help these grim pilgrims.”
Seb spat her agreement onto the courtyard brick and said flatly, “Dead is dead.”
“They are not dead,” said Elrahet, sneering.
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim. He’d seen enough of death to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive.
On second glance the pilgrim’s wounds were quite peculiar. The strip of missing skin on the outside of his thigh was circumscribed by white-pink rings of fresh skin.
Fresh skin…
Still growing…
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered. Mandri sprang back just as the man’s ruined head jerked up, tossing a spill of blood at Mandri’s feet. The pilgrim’s tongue twisted out of his yawning mouth as he tried in vain to grasp a wet breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs. He wheezed and gulped, and his chest heaved against the rope of thorns, but in the end his eyes rolled back and his whole body went limp and quiet.
“His very Spark is bound to the pole,” Elrahet explained. She seemed unable to look upon the pilgrim. “He will die, and die, and die again.” Her bottom lip quivered, and she seemed about to explode in rage, then she then stamped her cane into the ground and proclaimed, “This is not safe! We must leave at once!”
She hobbled back into the tunnel.
Moto was the first to follow. Then Ayram and Moteah. Mandri joined them in the shadow of the tower and was glad to be gone from that courtyard.
Seb remained.
“Hold on,” she said, indignant. “We’re goin’ back!? What about the Greskalun?” She jabbed an open hand towards the dark rent in the mountains behind, as if the Greskalun were right there and the others only had to squint a little to see them.
“There are no Greskalun,” Moteah said again.
But Seb stood her ground. “You can’t know that ‘til we go and have a look! We at least got to look!”
“That Pass is cursed!” Moto exclaimed, but Seb merely crossed her arms and argued, “Can’t be worse than Hrks.” 
Then, from the desert, there came a sharp and roaring bleat—the Hrkan horn of war.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommm

The call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and all eyes raced westward, for there in the distance was a speck of man set against the glare of the desert. All that could be made of him were the familiar blue robes of a Hrkan scribe. At his side was a shorter figure wrapped in black, a Mazidariga, and behind them, from around the sprawling tumble of the Goree’s shattered stones, was a double-column of white robed soldiers marching in even squares.
“RUN!” Ayram roared, and if that wasn’t enough to prod Mandri into motion, the Mazidariga’s warbling whistle split the air, sending Obo into convulsions inside his litter. 
Mandri turned and ran through the accursed courtyard, weaving a route around the pilgrim poles and up the courtyard slope. There the whistle pitched into a mind splitting squeal. Mandri dropped to his knees. He cowered against the sound, and he prayed a broken prayer between gasps as Obo’s psuedospark was stolen.
When the whistling stopped, Mandri shrugged himself out of the litter’s straps and turned around to discover that Obo had gone limp.
Moteah ran right by him.
So did Moto.
Mandri shouted, “They got Obo!” 
Seb as she passed by and she shouted back, “Get runnin’ or you’re next!”
Mandri picked the litter back up and ran. Ayram came galloping by with Elrahet clinging to his pack like a spider. 
“Hurry!” she screeched. She climbed over Ayram’s pack to ride his shoulders as he overtook the file and led the flight into the dark heart of the Goree Pass.</Text>

        <Title>Before Ixnay Hrks</Title>
        <Text>All the people of the continent know the story of the creation of the Goree Pass. It is a simple story. An ancient tribe, called the Solgruin, petitioned Solraheen to split the Goree mountains so that their overland journey east would be simpler. Solraheen denied them. He did not want to destroy any part of His creation for any reason, much less to accommodate trade. But the Solgruin asked again, and again, and on the fourth asking, Solraheen lost His patience. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there He stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
Then he spoke a curse into the chasm.
The words he spoke was heard by every ear in all the world, no matter how far.
“Look upon this scar which mars My creation. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, but so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
Mandri loved this story. It was one of his favorites. Solraheen had ripped up the greatest of the Goree just to spite the Solgruin. It gave him the perfect excuse to spite any client who was unhappy with his own creations. 
He’d only ever ripped up a painting once, but what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a whole month and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the outland King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent—she wanted Mandri to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would walk through her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by barbarians on a richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a coiled curtain rope and say, “That looks just like your Googum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Googum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with a righteous fury. His euphoria moved him to tear the painting completely in half, and he did it right in front of that bumbling woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have cursed that woman as Solraheen cursed those who journeyed the Goree Pass. But he didn’t—not out of decency. He simply didn’t believe curses worked. Curses, it turns out, can be avoided through the trick of reason.
Solraheen said, “Cursed are you who pass through it,” and it was argued that He meant ‘you’ to be a restrictive ‘you’, referring only to the Solgruin. If he had meant to curse everyone, surely He would have said, “Cursed are all who pass through it.” So everyone but the Solgruin could pass through fine. Pass through they did. After all, here was Mandri and the Ayramun, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the Pass. And people lived in the Pass, most notably the Greskalun, an old Jandri tribe whose ancient charge was to keep the pass free from anyone who had a single drop of Solgruin blood. This was more for the protection of the Solgruin than their punishment. Not that it mattered. The Solgruin had ceased to exist centuries ago.
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, and further out was the black rock sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone. There were a thousand staggered plateaus up there, looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress chain built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib. 
The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen’s spite became, for the Goree’s walls grew more worn and pitted, and higher up they were beset by jagged, fern-like cracks with stems stretching straight to the ground. An eon of blasting sand had rounded the edges of these cracks, pillowed the seams, giving the mountains the appearance of being bloated with infection.
It wasn’t long until the Pass itself was sighted. It was a shadowed, sloping cut in a distant plateau. A black needle poked up out of it. This needle was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the narrow breadth of the Pass. It protected against ancient evils. It was the Greskalun’s home.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through the debris field of a cataclysmic explosion. The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been impossible to believe if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Him standing up on a now vanished peak, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the swirling dust; a god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it. It would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt and the rest of creation would manifest His will. A tap of His toe could set the mountains quaking, bursting, and out would come a torrent of stones the size of houses. However it happened, it would have happened quickly. In the blink of an eye, a long sliver of the mountain were reduced to rubble.
The Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram kept his chin low, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his giant pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, as if his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—brooding and quiet.
Mandri was marching behind Seb, who was chewing her borcandi spines so hard that her jaw was going stiff. She had to sort of roll the spines between her stubby teeth instead of chew them. And the woman wasn’t paying attention to where she was spitting her juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, she hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel above her.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted herself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Jus’ try to disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me disrespect you?”
“Threaten a woman with her kneecaps? That’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“An accident.”
“I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He was so irritated with the two of them that he doubled back. “Nobody talk. Nobody except me.”
His grave visage lingered on Seb a moment, then he set off again towards the Pass, this time more cautiously, careful to crouch and hide his bulk behind boulders.
By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. This once living mountain was dead and rotted through and he could feel it. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock, for they were as friable as the hardtack he was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased—when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against the mountain’s foot, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the stone were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread.
Then there was the black tower that poked out of the Pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on a flat frontier was the only legitimate use of a tower. The only redeeming quality of the Goree’s tower was its monumental significance. The central task of a monument is to look like it doesn’t belong, and that tall spike sticking out of the Pass did this quite comfortably, marking a curse which should not have been. It seemed to say, “You’re going to die if you come any closer,” a sensation magnified by the brittle slopes which threatened to come galloping down upon Mandri’s head every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks as Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by the apparently invisible Hrkan pursuit some ways behind them. He pioneered a course that led up into crumbling mountains. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track them with a Mazidariga, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered from making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding their hopeful allies, the Greskalun. 
Then the narrow Goree pass opened up before them.
The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle of it. Stubby black walls filled the short gaps on either side of it. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s gate at its base, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off into the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb broke the rule of silence with a whisper. “Maybe they all left, went back to the temple.” She was so stressed out that she was chewing two spines at once and her words were garbled by a slosh of spit.
“Retreated?” Moteah asked. “From what?”
“Don’t ask me,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Mandri.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “Could be! Happened before. That’s what these pokes do when the pox gets on them, they run away then stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Then where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could.” 
“It’s the curse,” Elrahet grumbled.
“It is not cursed,” said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows. “Greskal and his kin have been living here since—”, but he was interrupted by the sight of a black vulture melting out of the tower’s pointed roof. It hissed as it took flight.
“Only a bird,” Ayram muttered as they all watched the creature spread its long wings and ride a thermal high up into the air, where it wheeled in circles.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and soared up to join their brother’s holding pattern. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient curse.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Ayram, “Then the Hrks would have choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The giant tried to maintain his stoic self but the mood was affecting even him, which was perfectly understandable, for the strongest men have the most to lose from a curse. It wasn’t something he could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion that everything was going according to plan.
Ayram marched over to Mandri, clenched jaw and all, and loomed over Mandri as the empty tower loomed over him.
“Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?”
There was no room in his tone for games.
“No?” Mandri answered, confused.
“When we found you in the Junei, you came from the east. Did you come from here?”
“No. If you are asking me if there’s an army of Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush us as soon as we step through that gate, I have no idea.”
Seb cleared her throat of spit and said, “No way it was Hrks. I’m tellin’ ya, them Greskalun are at Shulgi. Pox, Hrks, drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” Moteah said, doubtfully.
Elrahet grumbled at both women, and instead of explaining she reached down and grabbed a bone that was half buried in the dirt.
“What’s that?” Seb asked, surprised. 
Elrahet set the bone out before her, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle. Distinctively human.
“A sign of the Greskalun,” the witch growled.
Seb stomped over and nudged it with her toe. “Ya find one bone and think them dead? One bone in the ground? This ain’t unusual. Where else you expecting to find it? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Let her speak,” said Ayram.
Elrahet flipped over.
“Unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
She stroked the length of the bone’s fracture with a thin finger. It was a jagged feature which stretched almost along the whole length of the bone, leaving the upturned half looking like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unfazed.
“It’s a split bone. Splitting a bone lengthwise, like so, is difficult. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that would be expected, that’s how bones will break. A break such as this—it’s not likely to be an accident.”
Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. “You say this person was killed?” he asked. “That’s not unusual.”
Mandri glanced around uneasily. “I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the Pass.”
“We’re not in the Pass.”
“We are,” said Elrahet, “But that is not significant. What is, is that a blow to the leg would not crack the bone lengthwise like so. I’ve seen material such as this in an Old Jandri ruin. A dead people. Too many of them and not enough bread. They started eating each other. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone to gnaw on the spongy marrow. Lizards can’t do this. Neither can dogs. They don’t have the hands for it.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with visions of some grungy, sand-crusted cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his filed teeth.
Ayram held the bone away from him as if it were diseased. Elrahet yanked it from his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone into dirt, and as it fell, Moteah shouted, “Look!”
She was pointing towards the tower’s gate. Moto was sprinting away from it. He sprinted at full speed, frenetic, as if being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust.
When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!”
He looked over his shoulder, towards the tower, and grimaced.
When Ayram moved, the matter was decided—he would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower and its gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled. It bulged ever so slightly outward. Most of its bricks were chipped, some were twisted, some seemed to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The gate underneath was ten-men wide and its arch was fanged by metal teeth which would have scratched Ayram’s head if he did not duck. The gate tunnel was as long as the hall of a Hrkan Lord, cavernous enough to turn the thump of Ayram’s walking spear into an echoing beat. Aside from this steady meter, they passed through the dark in silence, casting wary glances at the empty door frames that pocketed either side.
Moto, who’d taken the lead, stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and it seemed as though a shadow passed over his face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it, and all around, stuck into the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were large wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
It was a desecration.
Such was the defilement that panic leapt into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. But he was rooted to the spot, for the horror robbed him of every faculty, and it set his stomach roiling in a terrible, growling fit, even Sparkless as it was.
The nearest wretch was only ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A devout Solitant pilgrim. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and seemingly boneless, lolled in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of Sol.
They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His broken scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor pilgrims littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted with the same unthinking cruelty.
Mandri muttered, “What is this?” and for once, no one answered.
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Seb, a woman who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil scene halfway through the tunnel, for she had not made it out into the courtyard. She was kept herself there inside in the tunnel’s shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep as if about to vomit.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye towards his mournful band. He said, “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks. Even Hrkan pilgrims. I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into her skin, and she said in turn, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? Sides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em ‘cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’!”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as she gestured at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.
“Moteah’s right.”
The stern assertion stunned them all back into silence, and Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the tunnel after the witch.
Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up as straight as her back allowed.
“Must have been the panic,” she said as she walked towards the courtyard. It seemed all her joints were aching, like every weary moment of the long journey was suddenly set upon her.
“Mere hate, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets a stomach growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light and surveyed the courtyard with a hateful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I don’t know what you—”
“PANIC!” Elrahet shrieked. “Panic sets the stomach growling. Panic wakes it up.”
“Wakes what up?” Mandri asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled.
“The Amalgamete.”
The graveled word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a rock aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“Twas the Amalgamete which did this,” she declared. “Twas a man who became the Amalgamete.”
Ayram, still composed, said, “We will do what we can for them, then we leave.”
“Nothing we can do can help these pilgrims,” said Elrahet grimly.
Seb spat her agreement onto the courtyard brick and said flatly, “Dead is dead.”
“They are not dead.”
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim. He’d seen enough of death to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive.
On second glance the pilgrim’s wounds were quite peculiar. The strip of missing skin on the outside of his thigh was circumscribed by white-pink rings of fresh skin.
Fresh skin…
Still growing…
Healing…
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered. Mandri sprang back just as the man’s ruined head jerked up, tossing a spill of blood at Mandri’s feet. The poor man’s tongue twisted out of his yawning mouth as he tried in vain to grasp a wet breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs. He wheezed and gulped, and his chest heaved against the rope of thorns, but in the end his eyes rolled back and his whole body went limp and quiet again.
“His very Spark is bound to the pole,” Elrahet explained. She seemed unable now to look upon the pilgrim. “He will die, and die, and die again.” Her bottom lip quivered, and she seemed about to explode in rage. She then stamped her cane into the ground and proclaimed, “We are not safe! We must leave at once!”
She hobbled back into the tunnel.
Moto was the first to follow. Then Ayram and Moteah. Mandri joined them in the shadow of the tower and was glad to be gone from that courtyard.
Seb remained.
“Hold on,” she said, indignant. “We’re goin’ back!? What about the Greskalun?” She jabbed an open hand towards the dark rent in the mountains behind, as if the Greskalun were right there and the others only had to squint a little to see them.
“There are no Greskalun,” Moteah said again.
But Seb stood her ground. “You can’t know that ‘til we go and have a look! We at least got to look!”
“That Pass is cursed!” Moto exclaimed, but Seb merely crossed her arms and argued, “Can’t be worse than the Hrks.” 
Then, from the desert, there came a sharp and roaring bleat—the Hrkan horn of war.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommm

The call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and all eyes raced westward, for there in the distance was a speck of man set against the glare of the desert. All that could be made of him were the familiar blue robes of a Hrkan scribe. At his side was a shorter figure wrapped in black. 
A Mazidariga.
Behind them, from around the sprawling tumble of the Goree’s shattered stones, was a double-column of white robed soldiers marching in even squares.
“RUN!” Ayram roared, and if that wasn’t enough to prod Mandri into motion, the Mazidariga’s warbling whistle split the air, shooting a splitting ache into his head. 
He turned and ran through the accursed courtyard, weaving a route around the pilgrim poles and up the courtyard slope. There the whistle pitched into a mind splitting squeal. He dropped to his knees, cowered against the sound, and he prayed a broken prayer between gasps as he could feel his breath begin to leave him.
Suddenly, the whistling faded.
Mandri could breathe again. When he slid back into the present moment he found that Ayram was carrying him out of the Riga’s range.
When Ayram saw that Mandri had come to, he set Mandri down.
Moteah ran right by them. As did Moto.
“Move!” Ayram barked at Mandri, and he set off galloping.
Seb bumped into Mandri’s back, sending them both into a tumble. They hurriedly picked themselves up and joined the others, Ayram leading, Elrahet clinging to his pack like a spider, snarling encouragement to her struggling tribe.</Text>

        <Title>Before reinserting Hrks</Title>
        <Text>All the people of the continent know the story of the creation of the Goree Pass. It is a simple story. An ancient tribe, called the Solgruin, petitioned Solraheen to split the Goree mountains so that their overland journey east would be simpler. Solraheen denied them. He did not want to destroy any part of His creation for any reason, much less to accommodate trade. But the Solgruin asked again, and again, and on the fourth asking, Solraheen lost His patience. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there He stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
Then he spoke a curse into the chasm.
The words he spoke was heard by every ear in all the world, no matter how far.
“Look upon this scar which mars My creation. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, but so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
Mandri loved this story. It was one of his favorites. Solraheen had ripped up the greatest of the Goree just to spite the Solgruin. It gave him the perfect excuse to spite any client who was unhappy with his own creations. 
He’d only ever ripped up a painting once, but what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a whole month and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the outland King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent—she wanted Mandri to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would walk through her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by barbarians on a richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a coiled curtain rope and say, “That looks just like your Googum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Googum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with a righteous fury. His euphoria moved him to tear the painting completely in half, and he did it right in front of that bumbling woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have cursed that woman as Solraheen cursed those who journeyed the Goree Pass. But he didn’t—not out of decency. He simply didn’t believe curses worked. Curses, it turns out, can be avoided through the trick of reason.
Solraheen said, “Cursed are you who pass through it,” and it was argued that He meant ‘you’ to be a restrictive ‘you’, referring only to the Solgruin. If he had meant to curse everyone, surely He would have said, “Cursed are all who pass through it.” So everyone but the Solgruin could pass through fine. Pass through they did. After all, here was Mandri and the Ayramun, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the Pass. And people lived in the Pass, most notably the Greskalun, an old Jandri tribe whose ancient charge was to keep the pass free from anyone who had a single drop of Solgruin blood. This was more for the protection of the Solgruin than their punishment. Not that it mattered. The Solgruin had ceased to exist centuries ago.
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, and further out was the black rock sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone. There were a thousand staggered plateaus up there, looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress chain built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib. 
The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen’s spite became, for the Goree’s walls grew more worn and pitted, and higher up they were beset by jagged, fern-like cracks with stems stretching straight to the ground. An eon of blasting sand had rounded the edges of these cracks, pillowed the seams, giving the mountains the appearance of being bloated with infection.
It wasn’t long until the Pass itself was sighted. It was a shadowed, sloping cut in a distant plateau. A black needle poked up out of it. This needle was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the narrow breadth of the Pass. It protected against ancient evils. It was the Greskalun’s home.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through the debris field of a cataclysmic explosion. The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been impossible to believe if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Him standing up on a now vanished peak, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the swirling dust; a god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it. It would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt and the rest of creation would manifest His will. A tap of His toe could set the mountains quaking, bursting, and out would come a torrent of stones the size of houses. However it happened, it would have happened quickly. In the blink of an eye, a long sliver of the mountain were reduced to rubble.
The Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram kept his chin low, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his giant pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, as if his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—brooding and quiet.
Mandri was marching behind Seb, who was chewing her borcandi spines so hard that her jaw was going stiff. She had to sort of roll the spines between her stubby teeth instead of chew them. And the woman wasn’t paying attention to where she was spitting her juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, she hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel above her.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted herself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Jus’ try to disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me disrespect you?”
“Threaten a woman with her kneecaps? That’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“An accident.”
“I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He was so irritated with the two of them that he doubled back. “Nobody talk. Nobody except me.”
His grave visage lingered on Seb a moment, then he set off again towards the Pass, this time more cautiously, careful to crouch and hide his bulk behind boulders.
By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. This once living mountain was dead and rotted through and he could feel it. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock, for they were as friable as the hardtack he was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased—when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against the mountain’s foot, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the stone were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread.
Then there was the black tower that poked out of the Pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on a flat frontier was the only legitimate use of a tower. The only redeeming quality of the Goree’s tower was its monumental significance. The central task of a monument is to look like it doesn’t belong, and that tall spike sticking out of the Pass did this quite comfortably, marking a curse which should not have been. It seemed to say, “You’re going to die if you come any closer,” a sensation magnified by the brittle slopes which threatened to come galloping down upon Mandri’s head every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks as Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by the apparently invisible Hrkan pursuit some ways behind them. He pioneered a course that led up into crumbling mountains. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track them with a Mazidariga, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered from making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding their hopeful allies, the Greskalun. 
Then the narrow Goree pass opened up before them.
The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle of it. Stubby black walls filled the short gaps on either side of it. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s gate at its base, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off into the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb broke the rule of silence with a whisper. “Maybe they all left, went back to the temple.” She was so stressed out that she was chewing two spines at once and her words were garbled by a slosh of spit.
“Retreated?” Moteah asked. “From what?”
“Don’t ask me,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Mandri.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “Could be! Happened before. That’s what these pokes do when the pox gets on them, they run away then stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Then where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could.” 
“It’s the curse,” Elrahet grumbled.
“It is not cursed,” said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows. “Greskal and his kin have been living here since—”, but he was interrupted by the sight of a black vulture melting out of the tower’s pointed roof. It hissed as it took flight.
“Only a bird,” Ayram muttered as they all watched the creature spread its long wings and ride a thermal high up into the air, where it wheeled in circles.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and soared up to join their brother’s holding pattern. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient curse.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Ayram, “Then the Hrks would have choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The giant tried to maintain his stoic self but the mood was affecting even him, which was perfectly understandable, for the strongest men have the most to lose from a curse. It wasn’t something he could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion that everything was going according to plan.
Ayram marched over to Mandri, clenched jaw and all, and loomed over Mandri as the empty tower loomed over him.
“Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?”
There was no room in his tone for games.
“No?” Mandri answered, confused.
“When we found you in the Junei, you came from the east. Did you come from here?”
“No. If you are asking me if there’s an army of Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush us as soon as we step through that gate, I have no idea.”
Seb cleared her throat of spit and said, “No way it was Hrks. I’m tellin’ ya, them Greskalun are at Shulgi. Pox, Hrks, drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” Moteah said, doubtfully.
Elrahet grumbled at both women, and instead of explaining she reached down and grabbed a bone that was half buried in the dirt.
“What’s that?” Seb asked, surprised. 
Elrahet set the bone out before her, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle. Distinctively human.
“A sign of the Greskalun,” the witch growled.
Seb stomped over and nudged it with her toe. “Ya find one bone and think them dead? One bone in the ground? This ain’t unusual. Where else you expecting to find it? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Let her speak,” said Ayram.
Elrahet flipped over.
“Unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
She stroked the length of the bone’s fracture with a thin finger. It was a jagged feature which stretched almost along the whole length of the bone, leaving the upturned half looking like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unfazed.
“It’s a split bone. Splitting a bone lengthwise, like so, is difficult. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that would be expected, that’s how bones will break. A break such as this—it’s not likely to be an accident.”
Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. “You say this person was killed?” he asked. “That’s not unusual.”
Mandri glanced around uneasily. “I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the Pass.”
“We’re not in the Pass.”
“We are,” said Elrahet, “But that is not significant. What is, is that a blow to the leg would not crack the bone lengthwise like so. I’ve seen material such as this in an Old Jandri ruin. A dead people. Too many of them and not enough bread. They started eating each other. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone to gnaw on the spongy marrow. Lizards can’t do this. Neither can dogs. They don’t have the hands for it.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with visions of some grungy, sand-crusted cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his filed teeth.
Ayram held the bone away from him as if it were diseased. Elrahet yanked it from his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone into dirt, and as it fell, Moteah shouted, “Look!”
She was pointing towards the tower’s gate. Moto was sprinting away from it. He sprinted at full speed, frenetic, as if being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust.
When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!”
He looked over his shoulder, towards the tower, and grimaced.
When Ayram moved, the matter was decided—he would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower and its gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled. It bulged ever so slightly outward. Most of its bricks were chipped, some were twisted, some seemed to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The gate underneath was ten-men wide and its arch was fanged by metal teeth which would have scratched Ayram’s head if he did not duck. The gate tunnel was as long as the hall of a Hrkan Lord, cavernous enough to turn the thump of Ayram’s walking spear into an echoing beat. Aside from this steady meter, they passed through the dark in silence, casting wary glances at the empty door frames that pocketed either side.
Moto, who’d taken the lead, stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and it seemed as though a shadow passed over his face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it, and all around, stuck into the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were large wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
It was a desecration.
Such was the defilement that panic leapt into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. But he was rooted to the spot, for the horror robbed him of every faculty, and it set his stomach roiling in a terrible, growling fit, even Sparkless as it was.
The nearest wretch was only ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A devout Solitant pilgrim. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and seemingly boneless, lolled in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of Sol.
They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His broken scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor pilgrims littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted with the same unthinking cruelty.
Mandri muttered, “What is this?” and for once, no one answered.
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Seb, a woman who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil scene halfway through the tunnel, for she had not made it out into the courtyard. She was kept herself there inside in the tunnel’s shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep as if about to vomit.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye towards his mournful band. He said, “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks. Even Hrkan pilgrims. I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into her skin, and she said in turn, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? Sides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em ‘cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’!”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as she gestured at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.
“Moteah’s right.”
The stern assertion stunned them all back into silence, and Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the tunnel after the witch.
Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up as straight as her back allowed.
“Must have been the panic,” she said as she walked towards the courtyard. It seemed all her joints were aching, like every weary moment of the long journey was suddenly set upon her.
“Mere hate, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets a stomach growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light and surveyed the courtyard with a hateful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I don’t know what you—”
“PANIC!” Elrahet shrieked. “Panic sets the stomach growling. Panic wakes it up.”
“Wakes what up?” Mandri asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled.
“The Amalgamete.”
The graveled word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a rock aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“Twas the Amalgamete which did this,” she declared. “Twas a man who became the Amalgamete.”
Ayram, still composed, said, “We will do what we can for them, then we leave.”
“Nothing we can do can help these pilgrims,” said Elrahet grimly.
Seb spat her agreement onto the courtyard brick and said flatly, “Dead is dead.”
“They are not dead.”
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim. He’d seen enough of death to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive.
On second glance the pilgrim’s wounds were quite peculiar. The strip of missing skin on the outside of his thigh was circumscribed by white-pink rings of fresh skin.
Fresh skin…
Still growing…
Healing…
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered. Mandri sprang back just as the man’s ruined head jerked up, tossing a spill of blood at Mandri’s feet. The poor man’s tongue twisted out of his yawning mouth as he tried in vain to grasp a wet breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs. He wheezed and gulped, and his chest heaved against the rope of thorns, but in the end his eyes rolled back and his whole body went limp and quiet again.
“His very Spark is bound to the pole,” Elrahet explained. She seemed unable now to look upon the pilgrim. “He will die, and die, and die again.” Her bottom lip quivered, and she seemed about to explode in rage. She then stamped her cane into the ground and proclaimed, “Haste!”
She hobbled on into the courtyard, drawing her cowl low against the sight of the unimaginable suffering. Ayram was the first to follow, then Moto and Moteah. Mandri kept close behind Moteah, careful to step in the same spots she was stepping. It seemed perilous to even open the mouth in this place, as the profane air might enter and infect it. Then came Seb just behind him,  chewing excitedly on her borcandi spine.

        <Title>Before Ixnay Riga\</Title>
        <Text>All the people of the continent know the story of the creation of the Goree Pass. It is a simple story. An ancient tribe, called the Solgruin, petitioned Solraheen to split the Goree mountains so that their overland journey east would be simpler. Solraheen denied them. He did not want to destroy any part of His creation for any reason, much less to accommodate trade. But the Solgruin asked again, and again, and on the fourth asking, Solraheen lost His patience. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there He stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
Then he spoke a curse into the chasm.
The words he spoke was heard by every ear in all the world, no matter how far.
“Look upon this scar which mars My creation. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, but so is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
Mandri loved this story. It was one of his favorites. Solraheen had ripped up the greatest of the Goree just to spite the Solgruin. It gave him the perfect excuse to spite any client who was unhappy with his own creations. 
He’d only ever ripped up a painting once, but what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a whole month and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he destroyed it because the woman who’d commissioned it said she wouldn’t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting’s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the outland King Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent—she wanted Mandri to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would walk through her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by barbarians on a richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a coiled curtain rope and say, “That looks just like your Googum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Googum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with a righteous fury. His euphoria moved him to tear the painting completely in half, and he did it right in front of that bumbling woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
If Mandri had the power, the gumption, he would have cursed that woman as Solraheen cursed those who journeyed the Goree Pass. But he didn’t—not out of decency. He simply didn’t believe curses worked. Curses, it turns out, can be avoided through the trick of reason.
Solraheen said, “Cursed are you who pass through it,” and it was argued that He meant ‘you’ to be a restrictive ‘you’, referring only to the Solgruin. If he had meant to curse everyone, surely He would have said, “Cursed are all who pass through it.” So everyone but the Solgruin could pass through fine. Pass through they did. After all, here was Mandri and the Ayramun, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the Pass. And people lived in the Pass, most notably the Greskalun, an old Jandri tribe whose ancient charge was to keep the pass free from anyone who had a single drop of Solgruin blood. This was more for the protection of the Solgruin than their punishment. Not that it mattered. The Solgruin had ceased to exist centuries ago.
Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, and further out was the black rock sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren’t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone. There were a thousand staggered plateaus up there, looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress chain built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib. 
The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen’s spite became, for the Goree’s walls grew more worn and pitted, and higher up they were beset by jagged, fern-like cracks with stems stretching straight to the ground. An eon of blasting sand had rounded the edges of these cracks, pillowed the seams, giving the mountains the appearance of being bloated with infection.
It wasn’t long until the Pass itself was sighted. It was a shadowed, sloping cut in a distant plateau. A black needle poked up out of it. This needle was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the narrow breadth of the Pass. It protected against ancient evils. It was the Greskalun’s home.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through the debris field of a cataclysmic explosion. The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been impossible to believe if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Him standing up on a now vanished peak, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the swirling dust; a god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it. It would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt and the rest of creation would manifest His will. A tap of His toe could set the mountains quaking, bursting, and out would come a torrent of stones the size of houses. However it happened, it would have happened quickly. In the blink of an eye, a long sliver of the mountain were reduced to rubble.
The Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram kept his chin low, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his giant pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, as if his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—brooding and quiet.
Mandri was marching behind Seb, who was chewing her borcandi spines so hard that her jaw was going stiff. She had to sort of roll the spines between her stubby teeth instead of chew them. And the woman wasn’t paying attention to where she was spitting her juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, she hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel above her.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted herself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Jus’ try to disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me disrespect you?”
“Threaten a woman with her kneecaps? That’s disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“An accident.”
“I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He was so irritated with the two of them that he doubled back. “Nobody talk. Nobody except me.”
His grave visage lingered on Seb a moment, then he set off again towards the Pass, this time more cautiously, careful to crouch and hide his bulk behind boulders.
By now the curse of the Goree was getting to Mandri. This once living mountain was dead and rotted through and he could feel it. All around the rock was split into smaller shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. Most of these shards could hardly be called rock, for they were as friable as the hardtack he was munching on. They crushed easily underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased—when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against the mountain’s foot, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the stone were a giant lump of crusty, moldy, hollowed out bread.
Then there was the black tower that poked out of the Pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on a flat frontier was the only legitimate use of a tower. The only redeeming quality of the Goree’s tower was its monumental significance. The central task of a monument is to look like it doesn’t belong, and that tall spike sticking out of the Pass did this quite comfortably, marking a curse which should not have been. It seemed to say, “You’re going to die if you come any closer,” a sensation magnified by the brittle slopes which threatened to come galloping down upon Mandri’s head every time a lizard stirred from its nook. And it wasn’t possible to keep away from the rocks as Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by the apparently invisible Hrkan pursuit some ways behind them. He pioneered a course that led up into crumbling mountains. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track them with a Mazidariga, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered from making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding their hopeful allies, the Greskalun. 
Then the narrow Goree pass opened up before them.
The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle of it. Stubby black walls filled the short gaps on either side of it. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s gate at its base, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from cow dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off into the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb broke the rule of silence with a whisper. “Maybe they all left, went back to the temple.” She was so stressed out that she was chewing two spines at once and her words were garbled by a slosh of spit.
“Retreated?” Moteah asked. “From what?”
“Don’t ask me,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Mandri.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “Could be! Happened before. That’s what these pokes do when the pox gets on them, they run away then stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Then where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could.” 
“It’s the curse,” Elrahet grumbled.
“It is not cursed,” said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows. “Greskal and his kin have been living here since—”, but he was interrupted by the sight of a black vulture melting out of the tower’s pointed roof. It hissed as it took flight.
“Only a bird,” Ayram muttered as they all watched the creature spread its long wings and ride a thermal high up into the air, where it wheeled in circles.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and soared up to join their brother’s holding pattern. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient curse.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Ayram, “Then the Hrks would have choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The giant tried to maintain his stoic self but the mood was affecting even him, which was perfectly understandable, for the strongest men have the most to lose from a curse. It wasn’t something he could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion that everything was going according to plan.
Ayram marched over to Mandri, clenched jaw and all, and loomed over Mandri as the empty tower loomed over him.
“Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?”
There was no room in his tone for games.
“No?” Mandri answered, confused.
“When we found you in the Junei, you came from the east. Did you come from here?”
“No. If you are asking me if there’s an army of Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush us as soon as we step through that gate, I have no idea.”
Seb cleared her throat of spit and said, “No way it was Hrks. I’m tellin’ ya, them Greskalun are at Shulgi. Pox, Hrks, drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for them, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Maybe,” Moteah said, doubtfully.
Elrahet grumbled at both women, and instead of explaining she reached down and grabbed a bone that was half buried in the dirt.
“What’s that?” Seb asked, surprised. 
Elrahet set the bone out before her, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle. Distinctively human.
“A sign of the Greskalun,” the witch growled.
Seb stomped over and nudged it with her toe. “Ya find one bone and think them dead? One bone in the ground? This ain’t unusual. Where else you expecting to find it? Find it floating in the air and maybe you’d have something.”
“Let her speak,” said Ayram.
Elrahet flipped over.
“Unusual fracture, isn’t it?”
She stroked the length of the bone’s fracture with a thin finger. It was a jagged feature which stretched almost along the whole length of the bone, leaving the upturned half looking like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unfazed.
“It’s a split bone. Splitting a bone lengthwise, like so, is difficult. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that would be expected, that’s how bones will break. A break such as this—it’s not likely to be an accident.”
Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his giant, probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. “You say this person was killed?” he asked. “That’s not unusual.”
Mandri glanced around uneasily. “I thought violence wasn’t allowed in the Pass.”
“We’re not in the Pass.”
“We are,” said Elrahet, “But that is not significant. What is, is that a blow to the leg would not crack the bone lengthwise like so. I’ve seen material such as this in an Old Jandri ruin. A dead people. Too many of them and not enough bread. They started eating each other. You see, this is the kind of fracture a madman makes when he wants to open the bone to gnaw on the spongy marrow. Lizards can’t do this. Neither can dogs. They don’t have the hands for it.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with visions of some grungy, sand-crusted cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his filed teeth.
Ayram held the bone away from him as if it were diseased. Elrahet yanked it from his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone into dirt, and as it fell, Moteah shouted, “Look!”
She was pointing towards the tower’s gate. Moto was sprinting away from it. He sprinted at full speed, frenetic, as if being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust.
When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!”
He looked over his shoulder, towards the tower, and grimaced.
When Ayram moved, the matter was decided—he would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower and its latticed iron gate. The tower, which had seemed sturdy from afar, was ancient and cobbled. It bulged ever so slightly outward. Most of its bricks were chipped, some were twisted, some seemed to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The entry underneath was ten-men wide and its sliding gate was fanged by metal teeth which would have scratched Ayram’s head if he did not duck. The tunnel beyond was as long as the hall of a Hrkan Lord, cavernous enough to turn the thump of Ayram’s walking spear into an booming beat. Aside from this steady meter, they passed through the dark in silence, casting wary glances at the empty door frames that pocketed either side.
Moto, who’d taken the lead, stopped at the end of the tunnel, just before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He glanced back at all who followed, and it seemed as though a shadow passed over his face.
The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick yard as old as the tower itself, grooved down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it, and all around, stuck into the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were large wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
It was a desecration.
Such was the defilement that panic leapt into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. But he was rooted to the spot, for the horror robbed him of every faculty, and it set his stomach roiling in a terrible, growling fit, even Sparkless as it was.
The nearest wretch was only ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A devout Solitant pilgrim. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and seemingly boneless, lolled in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of Sol.
They were all pilgrims, maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place. Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His broken scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor pilgrims littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted with the same unthinking cruelty.
Mandri muttered, “What is this?” and for once, no one answered.
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Seb, a woman who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. The witch Elrahet must have sensed the evil scene halfway through the tunnel, for she had not made it out into the courtyard. She was kept herself there inside in the tunnel’s shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep as if about to vomit.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye towards his mournful band. He said, “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks. Even Hrkan pilgrims. I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into her skin, and she said in turn, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? Sides, there’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em ‘cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’!”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as she gestured at the carnage. “Greskal ain’t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.
“Moteah’s right.”
The stern assertion stunned them all back into silence, and Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the tunnel after the witch.
Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, and she stood up as straight as her back allowed.
“Must have been the panic,” she said as she walked towards the courtyard. It seemed all her joints were aching, like every weary moment of the long journey was suddenly set upon her.
“Mere hate, no, that wouldn’t have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets a stomach growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light and surveyed the courtyard with a hateful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I don’t know what you—”
“PANIC!” Elrahet shrieked. “Panic sets the stomach growling. Panic wakes it up.”
“Wakes what up?” Mandri asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled.
“The Amalgamete.”
The graveled word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a rock aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“Twas the Amalgamete which did this,” she declared. “Twas a man who became the Amalgamete.”
Ayram, still composed, said, “We will do what we can for them, then we leave.”
“Nothing we can do can help these pilgrims,” said Elrahet grimly.
Seb spat her agreement onto the courtyard brick and said flatly, “Dead is dead.”
“They are not dead.”
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim. He’d seen enough of death to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive.
On second glance the pilgrim’s wounds were quite peculiar. The strip of missing skin on the outside of his thigh was circumscribed by white-pink rings of fresh skin.
Fresh skin…
Still growing…
Healing…
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered. Mandri sprang back just as the man’s ruined head jerked up, tossing a spill of blood at Mandri’s feet. The poor man’s tongue twisted out of his yawning mouth as he tried in vain to grasp a wet breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs. He wheezed and gulped, and his chest heaved against the rope of thorns, but in the end his eyes rolled back and his whole body went limp and quiet again.
“His very Spark is bound to the pole,” Elrahet explained. She seemed unable to look upon the pilgrim. “His body will die, and die, and die again.” Her bottom lip trembled as she fought to contain her rage. She swayed silently, boiling inside, and just as it seemed she were about to faint she stamped her cane into the ground and furiously proclaimed, “We leave at once!”
She hobbled back into the tower’s tunnel, mumbling curses along the way. Moto was the first to follow, then Ayram and Moteah. Mandri trailed them all eagerly, glad to be moving away from the obscenity.
Seb remained.
“Hol’ on,” she said, indignant. “We goin’ back!? What about the Greskalun?” She jabbed an open hand towards the dark rent in the mountains behind, as if the Greskalun were right there and the others only had to squint to see them.
“There are no Greskalun,” Moteah called back.
“You know that? Horseshit! They could be hidin’ up at Shulgi. They could be waitin’ for us to come an—”
“Look!” Moto shouted. He pointed west towards the open desert. There the sprawling tumble of the Goree’s shattered stones were trampled underfoot by a white horse bearing a blue-robed rider. Behind them, emerging from their kicked-up dust like a dream was a double-column of white robed soldiers marching in even squares, their bearing made clear by a sharp and roaring bleat—the Hrkan horn of war.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommm

Bouncing in the blue-robed rider’s lap was a shorter figure wrapped in black. 
A Mazidariga.
“RUN!” Ayram roared, and if that wasn’t enough to prod Mandri into motion, the Mazidariga’s warbling whistle pierced the air.
He turned and tried to run as the whistling pitched into a mind splitting squeal. He collapsed to his knees, cowered against the sound, and he prayed a broken prayer between gasps as he felt his breath begin to leave him. He choked and swallowed, then someone grabbed the scruff of his robe and lifted him off the ground. It was Ayram, hoping to flee, but before he could gather Mandri under his arm the Riga’s whistle pitched again, crescendoing into a tinny screech that sent Mandri into convulsions. 
Mandri’s stomach retched, his chest heaved, his head slumped back into the crook of Ayram’s arm as a dim gray cloud spewed out out his mouth. Ayram reached out to try and gather it, that he might stuff it back down Mandri’s throat, but the smoke only flowed between his fingers.
The whistling shifted again, higher still, and the cloud reformed as it zipped past Ayram’s ear. It flew through the tunnel, towards the horse and rider, leaving the rest of the Ayramun watching in helpless panic. All the while, the distant line of soldiers continued marching.
Moteah sprinted towards the gate, climbed an exposed flight of steps that led up to the gate’s winch, and threw her whole weight against the nearest lever. The whole contraption failed to budge.
“Let them come,” Moto said, employing a mad grin. “This is good!” he bellowed as he drew his sword and punched at the tower’s bricks with the its pommel. After a few swift strokes the brick’s mortar was crumbling off in chunks. “You see!? The whole tower is ready to come down. They’ve stumbled into another Minting Rock and we should encourage it! We will take the Riga as easy as before.”
“Idiot!” Seb cried. “Of all the pokes in the world…we need to run!”
“Run where?” Moto countered.
“To the Greskalun! They’ll help!”
Seb set her pleading eyes on Ayram, looking for leadership.
Ayram looked to Elrahet.
The old witch stood silent at the side of the tunnel, bracing herself against the tower black. She stared intently at the desert, as if noticing the details and logging them. She was, Mandri knew, beholding the scene. While beholding is not a lossless art, if the eye is practiced, what gets lost has chance of being reconstructed later. At least, that was the hope. In truth it was all a fantasy, this artist’s noticing, this lover’s noticing, noticing to remember. That woman there was living in the moment so that in the future she could dwell in a fictitious past, one which centered herself and neglected to account for the private lives of anyone not in view. That included most of the world. And that included Mandri. Ayram tossed him aside, and his sudden thump against ground would be forgotten by everyone but himself.
He lay there, fly-swatted, struggling terribly against a renewed urge to breathe as well as the niggling thought that perhaps—perhaps—the scene splayed out before him was worth painting, regardless of the lies it would contain. There was something about the spike of the tower’s shadow. It was full of subtle, sumptuous grays that seemed purplish blue when set against the sunlit sand. People ought to know about them. And there was the northern wind flicking little spindrifts off the sloping backs of boulders. Then came the Hrkan horse, splendid white, white as Solraheen. A healthy creature, it’s brushed muscles furrowed and bulged as it charged towards the tower. It’s richly braided tail fluttered behind, and the scribe’s blue robe was resplendent even as his legs flapped against the saddle, his heels urging the beast onwards. Together with the Riga they rode right up to the tower’s shadow, and there the horse came to a shuffling stop before rearing up, almost to the point of no control. The staging here was perfect, for the warm spectral edge of the tower's penumbra cut right across the Riga child’s neck.
Fitted in to the sand behind them was that white line of Hrkan soldiers, marching at pace. It would take a large canvas to do them justice. Mandri twinged at the thought having to fill so large a frame. Perhaps it wasn’t worth painting after all.
Then the scribe unsheathed a sword and raised it high. He held it high as he calmed his horse, and when the beast was settled, he let that sword slip from its high perch and it fell blade-first into the sand.
“He wants to bargain?” Moto asked, awestruck.
Seb uncoiled, “It’s a trick!”
Elrahet loomed large in the foreground, a cowled figure draped in shadow. Ayram, his leg a giant bar in Mandri’s periphery, broker her concentration with a question. His deep, resonant voice carried like the echo of a drum.
“Do you see a path?”
Elrahet nodded, though her neck stiffened, as if resisting the motion. That, and the twitching crick in the corner of her lip betrayed a great reluctance. No doubt she beheld dark tidings in that line of Hrkan men, and yet, permission was given to treat with them.
Ayram swung his great pack off his shoulders. The straps creaked, and the heavy load hit the stone floor with a thud, scattering a fine layer of dust right into Mandri’s face. By the time Mandri could see clearly again, the white horse was half prancing in a deliberate trot towards the tower. The scribe was alone in the saddle. The Riga child had dismounted and was standing back.
Both the horse and scribe kept their chins tilted high as they approached the tower’s gate. If the scribe was perturbed by the sight of a giant wielding an iron spear, he did not show it. He rode with the bearing of a practical man, and he had the face of a true believer, stressed by the sun but unbothered by doubt. His face was scrunched into a serious glare, but underneath, Mandri saw naturally jolly features—round, unworried eyes, and round cheeks. A thick headscarf was sat back on his head, letting a tuft of black hair shower out. The scarf was so fat that it folded his fatty ears out and down, making them look a bit like little wings. This gave his head the appearance of taking flight, as if it were straining to lift off from the plinth that was his beard.
“It is good that you have given up the chase,” he said with a voice sharp and intelligent. His nose flared as he pulled his horse to heel, and he sniffed that elevated air of authority. “It is known that when you try to draw up water you cannot reach, you become weak.”
Ayram brandished his spear, remembering its weight.
“Not that you’re wanting for strength,” the scribe added. His eyes swept over Ayram as if sizing up a slave. He smiled, and graciously gave Ayram room to speak, but Ayram simply stood there in defiance.
The scribe glanced over his own shoulder, towards the distant ranks of his onrushing army. The glint of their spears and the slow churn of their glorious white banner brought a flicker of confidence to his eye.
“I am here to inform you of the consequences of your actions,” he said, turning his attention again to Ayram. “I won’t bother you with a lecture. The Mazid in your possession once belonged to the Lordship. You stole it. You are to suffer for that crime. I am supposed to tell you that cooperation will bring you benefit, but…” His lips tightened into a pained smile, as if admitting the low dignity of his office. “I know you think that you should resist, that surrender will not wear you well, but—”
 Ayram grunted in amusement.
“I don’t doubt that you could make things difficult,” The scribe said honestly. “You could vanish into these mountains. You might fight until you break. But believe when I say that you should deal with me rather than someone else.”
He paused again to encourage Ayram to speak, but it was the sound of Elrahet’s cane which broke the silence—a lurching tap-tap against the tunnel’s stone floor. The scribe’s face hardened as his eyes outlined her crooked silhouette swaying through the shadow.
Elrahet’s voice scratched at the ears.
“What is your name, Hrkman?”
The scribe’s red brow furrowed. He straightened in his saddle, and his grip tightened on the reins. “For our purposes, I have no name. I am here to represent the Lordship.”
Elrahet gave a heavy sigh, then leaned heavy on her cane, her knotted hands curling around its knotted handle. “I have dealt with your Lords and their littler Lords,” she said. “Here, now, I will deal with you.”
“I believe you have misread the situation,” the scribe countered. “This is not a negotiation. You will surrender, and then I will decide what to do with you.”
“Do you not wear scribal robes?”
“I do,” he said, shoulders squaring. “But it is not my duty to—”
“Are you not sworn to protect your Lordship?”
“With every breath.”
“Then breathe deeply, Hrkman, for your Lordship’s fate rests in my hand.”
The scribe’s beard spread into a appreciative smile. He peered into the darkness of the tunnel as if expecting to recognize Elrahet to be an old friend.
“If you are referring to the Mazid in your possession,” he said, “then you are twice mistaken. The Mazid has been defeated, and so it is of little concern. It will be disposed of. The rest of you, you have lives ahead of you. If you can believe it.”
“I do not speak of the Mazid.”
“Please, I know your kind—if you had any leverage, you’d be using it, not threating to use it. Abuse of power is in your nature, as a witch. You cannot help yourselves.”
“And what is your nature?”
“I reflect the Lordship.”
“Come then,” Elrahet said as she stepped aside. “Come and lay the light of the Lordship onto a land which has never seen it.”
The scribe shifted in his saddle. “I’m not sure I understand your proposal.”
“There is something you must see, that you may be informed of the consequences of your actions.”
The scribe’s smile grew wider, and before he could work through it, Elrahet pressed on.
“Are you not curious as to why we stole your Mazid?” she asked. “Did you ever wonder where we were going, or, what will happen, now that you’ve stopped us?”
“It hardly matters, does it?”
“And yet,” said Elrahet, frowning. “There is something I could show you.”
“This ‘thing’ you wish to show me, it threatens Lordship?”
“It does,” said Elrahet nodding. “So, come! Do not be frightened, Hrkman. Does the light of the Lordship not protect you still?”
The scribe twisted in his saddle and looked for his strength in the army marching behind him, but the sight of that line of spears no longer seemed to lift him.
“Come!” Elrahet beckoned.
Mandri saw a glint of gold sparkle at her side—there was that dreaded knife in her hand when it was not there before. Her robes fluttered, and as fast as the golden blade appeared, it lashed out at the empty air, then vanished.
The act was fleeting, but enough. Whether it was magic or mere distracting motion, the scribe’s attention snapped back to her as though she’d shouted his name.
“What is it you want to show me?” he asked.
Ayram answered, voice steady and commanding.
“A great evil dwells in these mountains. We were meant to kill it. Now that you’ve interrupted us, that evil is a threat to all.”
“That’s why you stole the Mazid? To go on a hunt? Not likely.”
“The truth lies beyond the tunnel.”
Ayram pointed with his spear, but the scribe only rolled his eyes and said impatiently, “I’ll ask again—what is it you want to show me?”
“Scourged pilgrims.”
The scribe’s face darkened at this blasphemous pairing of words. He leaned forward, and he peered now into the dark of the tunnel, and instead of bouncing his suspicion between the weatherbeaten Ayramun, he looked right past them. Something in the sunlight on the other side must have caught his notice, a flash of a yellow haircloth habit perhaps, for his eyes flared and he urged his horse forward.
He rode through the tunnel without regard for his own safety. The Ayramun could have set themselves upon him with ease. Mandri could not place him until he caught Mandri’s eye, and there in shadow of his brow was a righteous fury. His gaze lingered for only a moment, for it was pulled by the courtyard’s brightness, there at once the horror was upon him.
This man, younger than his grooming might suggest, wore the exact same look Mandri wore when he saw his first masterpiece—stunned surprise, then awe, then came the quenching of a heretofore unnoticed thirst as the majesty of the work began to reveal answers to questions he’d never thought to ask.
On instinct, the scribe spurred his horse forward, and though the horse tossed its head, distressed by its rider’s cue, it pressed on.
And yes, majesty can be terrifying. And those pilgrim poles were indeed a masterpiece, for what is a masterpiece but the realization of undreamt possibility? A masterwork forces confronts a person with their own ignorance—did the pilgrim poles not do this?
Now that Mandri was seeing through this lens, a truer horror began to settle in, for where before he saw unreason and carnage, he saw now a calculating mind. Every cut, every aching wound was a conscious decision, all of it meant to bring the—
“Damn you!” The scribe screamed. It wasn’t clear if the words were for his fidgeting horse, who threated to unseat him, for the perpetrators of the crime, who were no doubt destined for Shis already, or for Mandri, whose thoughts were straying dangerously close to heresy.
Of course, Mandri knew the scribe could not possibly understand the moment in this way. That man on his mount moved before this field of torture like some overgrown rat, hesitant to get too close, confused by a world too large for him. When he swiveled in his saddle to look for Elrahet, it seemed as if he’d gone mad.
“What is this!?” he demanded, voice brittle with rage.
Elrahet, respectful, stepped out of the shadow, though she did not speak. Her silence unsettled the scribe even further.
—-
Until Elrahet finally spoke.
“What is you’re name, Hrkman?”
“Pyetle,” the scribe muttered, forgetting his earlier reservations.
“Py-etle,” Elrahet said, playing with the sounds. “Your name stands now on the spine of a history book. Your next choice will fill the pages.” 
Pyetle squirmed in his saddle and regarded Elrahet with plain derision.
“You expect me to listen to you? I find a witch next to a witch’s work and you expect me to believe you had nothing to do with this!?”
“If not a witch,” said Elrahet, “Who else?”
“Indeed! Who else!? Who—”
Pyetle turned again to the pilgrim poles as if struck by a revelation. But this was short-lived, and he visibly sank into confusion.
“Who sees its own shadow and cries in fright?” said Elrahet. “Who lingers in darkness and shuns the light?”
 “Demons!?” Pyetle exclaimed. His horse reared as though the word had nipped its ankle. Pyetle struggled to calm both himself and his mount, but when it was done, some semblance of order came to him, and his eyes darted from the poles to Elrahet, to the Ayramun, to Mandri.  
“I suppose you want me to let you go?” he said. “I should leave you to your righteous hunt?”
“First, you must return the Mazid’s breath to his body”
“Why would I ever do that?”
“Someone must kill the beast that did this.”
Pyetle looked again upon the pilgrims, and this steeled his nerves. He kicked his horse hard and shouted, “Hee-AH!”
His yell startled the horse out of its private, and it leaped into the tunnel. The scribe leaned low against its neck as the magnificent creature galloped under the gate and out into the mouth of the Goree Pass.
The Ayramun watched with bated breath as Pyetle exchanged words with the captain of the Hrkan army. When the Scribe returned, he was flanked by escort of spears.
“If night falls and we have not found sign of a great demon, you will be held accountable for this sacrilege.”
He spoke to all.
“Blow your horn,” Ayram said. “Best let them know we are coming.”

        <Title>REAL before Ixnay Riga.</Title>
        <Text>The story of the creation of the Goree Pass is a simple story. An ancient tribe, called the Solgruin, petitioned Solraheen to split the Goree mountains so that they might profit from an overland route to the east. Solraheen denied them. He did not want to destroy any part of His creation for any reason, much less to accommodate trade. The next year, the Solgruin asked again, and again they were denied. They waited another year to ask again, on the off chance that Solraheen, the god of all creation, might change His mind. On the sixth asking, Solraheen lost His patience. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there He stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. Thus, a great fissure was opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
Then he spoke a curse into the chasm.
The words he spoke were heard by every ear in all the world, no matter how far.
“Look upon this scar which mars My creation. This mountain impeded your ways, so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, as is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
Mandri loved this story. Solraheen ripped up one of His greatest works just to spite a client who requested an alteration. Mandri himself had ripped up a painting once, and what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a whole month and a small fortune painting this particular painting. The subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the Outland Prince Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent—the client wanted Mandri to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would walk through her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by barbarians on a richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a coiled curtain rope and say, “That looks just like your Googum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Googum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but no, he tore the painting completely in half. He did it right in front of that bumbling woman. The shock and horror on her face as he clawed out the staples on the frame to really rip thing full was cathartic. Then her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
Mandri would have cursed her, but he never learned any words of power because the Goree Pass proved that curses were ineffective on people who needed to be cursed. Solraheen stood atop the Goree and said, “Cursed are you who pass through it,” and people passed through it. These people argued that Solraheen’s ‘you’ was an exclusive ‘you’, referring only to the Solgruin. If Solraheen had meant to curse everyone, then surely He would have said, “Cursed are all who pass through it.” Since He didn’t say that, people made the pass without a care, and most of them went on to live happy, fulfilling lives, which was an injustice.
Solraheen didn’t rip up the Goree for the Solgruin alone, he ripped it up for everyone. The curse should apply evenly to everyone. What twist of logic defeated this, Mandri didn’t know. It couldn’t be that, if someone could convince themselves that they were free from words of power, then they were.
Mandri ventured south in the cold shadow of the Goree mountains, lagging a behind the Ayramun, for he was busy trying to convince himself that towering mountains to his left had no eye for him. There were a thousand staggered plateaus up there, blocking the morning light. They looked like squat redoubts, each a link in a fortress chain built by Solraheen to hold back the winds which swept the Tib, which lined the horizon to the right. Naturally, the further south he walked, the clearer Solraheen’s curse became. The massive rock faces grew more worn and pitted with every step. Higher up, they were beset by jagged, fern-like cracks whose stems stretched all the way down to the ground. An eon of blasting sand had rounded down the edges, pillowed the seams, giving these mountain cheeks the appearance of being bloated with infection.
Mandri reminded himself that the story of the Pass was only a story. Anyone could have made it up.  Besides, people actually lived in the Pass. The Greskalun lived in it. According to the story, the Greskalun were an Old Jandri tribe who were charged with keeping the pass free from the Solgruin. But the Solgruin had ceased to exist centuries ago, and the Greskalun were still there.
Soon, the Pass itself was sighted; a shadowed, sloping cut in a distant plateau. A black needle poked straight up out of it. This needle was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the narrow breadth of the Pass. It protected against ancient evils. It was the Greskalun’s home.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through the debris field of a cataclysmic explosion. The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been impossible to believe if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Him standing up high on a now vanished peak, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the swirling dust. A god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it. It would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt and the whole vigor of creation would start to stir. A tap of His toe could set the mountains quaking, and out would come a torrent of stones the size of houses. The whole pass, that long sliver of the mountain, might have parted itself into rubble at the snap of His finger.
The Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram kept his chin low, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his giant pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, as if his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—brooding and quiet.
Mandri was marching behind Seb, who was chewing her borcandi spines so hard that her jaw was going stiff. She had to sort of roll the spines between her stubby teeth instead of chew them. And she wasn’t paying attention to where she was spitting her juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, she hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel above her.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted herself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Jus’ try an’ disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me, disrespect you?”
“Threaten a woman with her own kneecaps? Downright disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“An accident.”
“I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He was so irritated with the two of them that he doubled back. “Nobody talk. Nobody except me.”
They all stood still until Moto’s complaining shoulder’s settled down, and Seb swallowed her spit. Then Ayram set off again towards the Pass, this time more cautiously, crouching, trying to hide his bulk behind upright shards of stone.
Stands of rock were scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. They were each as friable as the hardtack Mandri was munching on. Their bases crushed easily underfoot. The mountain itself was no different; when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against the mountain’s foot, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the stone were nothing but the moldy crust of a hollowed out bread loaf. And then there was the black tower which poked out of the Pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on a flat frontier was the only legitimate use of a tower.
The only redeeming quality of the Goree’s tower was its monumental significance. The central task of a monument is to look like it doesn’t belong, and that tall spike sticking out of the Pass did this quite admirably, marking a curse which should not have been.
It seemed to say, “You are going to die if you come any closer.”
This sensation was magnified by the brittle slopes which threatened to come galloping down upon Mandri’s head every time a lizard stirred from its nook. It wasn’t possible to keep away from these rocks as Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by the apparently invisible Hrkan pursuit some ways behind them to the north. He pioneered a course that led up into crumbling mountains. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track them with a Riga, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered from making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding their hopeful allies, the Greskalun. There was no sign of them, not until they came into the mouth of the Pass.
The great black tower stood proudly, right in the middle of it. Stubby black walls filled the short gaps on either side of it. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s gate at its base, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off into the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb broke the rule of silence with a whisper. “Maybe ‘ey all lef’, wen’ back to tha Shulgi.” Her words were garbled by a slosh of spit. She was so stressed out that she was chewing two spines at once. 
“Retreated?” Moteah asked. “From what?”
“Don’t ask me,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Mandri.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “Could be! Happen’ afore. That’s what these pokes do when pox gets on ‘em, they run away, then stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Then where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could.” 
“Then it might be the curse,” Seb offered.
“It is not cursed,” said Ayram with all the assurance of a big man who knows. “Greskal and his kin have been living here since—”, but he was interrupted by the sight of a black vulture melting out of the tower’s pointed roof. It squawked as it took flight.
They all watched the creature spread its long wings and ride a thermal high up into the air, where it wheeled in circles.
“Only a bird,” Ayram muttered.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and soared up to join their brother’s holding pattern. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient words of power.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Ayram, “Then the Hrks would have choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The giant tried to maintain his stoic self but the mood was affecting even him, which was perfectly understandable, for the strongest men have the most to lose from a curse. It wasn’t something he could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion that everything was going according to plan.
He marched over to Mandri, clenched jaw and all, and loomed as large as the empty tower behind his shoulder.
“Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?” he asked.
There was no room in his tone for games.
“No?” Mandri answered, confused.
“When we found you in the Junei, you had come from the east. Did you come from here?”
“No…If you are asking me if there’s an army of Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush us as soon as we step through that gate, I have no idea.”
Seb cleared her throat of spit and said, “No way it was Hrks. I’m tellin’ ya, them Greskalun are at Shulgi. Pox, Hrks, drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for ‘em, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Might be,” Moteah said, doubtfully.
Elrahet grumbled at both women, and instead of explaining she reached down and grabbed a bone that was half buried in the dirt. She set the bone out before her, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle. Distinctively human.
“A sign of the Greskalun,” she growled. “They are dead.”
Seb stomped over and nudged the bone with her toe. “Ya find one bone and think em dead? One bone?”
“It shouldn’t be here.”
“Where else ya expect to find it, but the ground? Find it floatin’ in the air an maybe we got somethin’.”
“Let her speak,” said Ayram.
Elrahet squatted next the bone and turned it over.
“Here’s an unusual fracture, no?”
She stroked the length of the bone’s fracture with a thin finger. It was a jagged feature which stretched along the whole length of the bone, leaving the upturned half looking like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unfazed.
“It’s a split bone. Splitting a bone lengthwise like this is difficult. If it were snapped in two like a dead twig, that could be expected. A break such as this…it’s not likely to have been an accident.”
She held it up for Ayram to inspect. He took it, and in his giant, probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. “Are you claiming this person was killed?” he asked. “That’s not unusual.”
“A blow to the leg,” Elrahet said, “would not crack a bone lengthwise. This is different. This, I’ve seen before in an Old Jandri ruin…a long dead tribe. Too many of people and not enough bread…It wasn’t lizards that split those bones. It wasn’t dogs—they don’t have the hands for it.” She pointed a gnarled finger at that dreadful broken bone. “That is the fracture a madman makes when he hungers for the spongy marrow.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with a vision of some sand-crusted cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were a chicken leg. Strings of fat and tendons were getting caught in the gaps of his filed teeth.
Ayram held the bone away as if it were diseased. Elrahet plucked it from his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone into dirt. When it landed, Moteah shouted, “Look!”
She was pointing towards the tower’s gate. Moto was sprinting away from it. He sprinted at full speed, frenetic, as if being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust.
When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!”
He looked over his shoulder, towards the tower, and grimaced.
Ayram moved, and the matter was decided—he would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower. It seemed sturdy from afar, but up close it was ancient and hobbled. It bulged ever so slightly outward. Most of its bricks were chipped, some were twisted, some were somehow pulled halfway out, as if suggesting a climb. It all seemed to about to crumble. 
They pressed on into the entrance mouth, which was ten-men wide with a drawn-up gate bearing metal fangs which would have scratched Ayram’s head if he did not duck. The tunnel beyond was perhaps fifty yards, cavernous enough to turn the thump of Ayram’s walking spear into an booming beat. Beside this steady meter, they passed through the shadow in silence, glancing into the empty doorways that pocketed either side.
Moto, who’d taken the lead, stopped before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He looked back at all who followed, and a shadow of pain passed over his face.
Mandri’s black stomach churned into growling fit. He hurried out into the broad courtyard to get out from under the Tower’s oppression. There, the cobbled bricks were as old as the tower itself, grooved as they were down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels. All around them, stuck into the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were large wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
A desecration.
Such was the defilement that panic leaped into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. But he was rooted to the spot, for the horror robbed him of every faculty.
The nearest wretch was only ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption; a devout Solitant pilgrim. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and seemingly boneless, lolled in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by the grace of Schisol.
Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there, and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His broken scalp was crudely shaved, chunked, and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful derision. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of thee poor pilgrims littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted with the same unthinking cruelty. They were all pilgrims. Maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason, and reason had abandoned this place. 
“What is this?” Mandri muttered, and for once, no one answered.
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Seb, a woman who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. The witch Elrahet must have sensed this evil scene halfway through the tunnel, for she had not made it out into the courtyard. She kept herself there inside in the shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep as if about to vomit.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye towards his mournful band. “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks,” he said. “I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into her skin, and she said in turn, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? There’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em cuz we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’!”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go an find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as she gestured at the carnage. “I’m with Ayram. Greskal ain’t the only poke who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out grumble came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.
“Moteah’s right.”
Her sternness stunned them all back into silence, and Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the tunnel where the witch gave a rattling sigh, then she stood up as straight as her back allowed.
“Must have been the panic,” she said as she walked towards the courtyard. It seemed all her joints were aching, like every weary moment of the long journey was suddenly set upon her.
“Mere hate, no, that would not have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets a stomach growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light and surveyed the courtyard with a hateful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I don’t know what you—”
“PANIC!” Elrahet shrieked. “Panic sets the stomach growling. Panic wakes it up.”
“Wakes what up?” Mandri asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled.
“The Burshageet.”
The graveled word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a rock aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“Twas the Burshageet which did this,” she declared. “Before, or after, it ate the Greskalun.”
“We will do what we can for them,” Ayram said. “Then we leave.”
“We can do nothing to help these folk,” said Elrahet grimly.
Seb spat her agreement onto the courtyard brick and said flatly, “Dead is dead.”
“Oh, they are not dead.”
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim. He’d seen enough of death to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been tortured beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive.
On second glance the pilgrim’s wounds were quite peculiar. The strip of missing skin on the outside of his thigh was circumscribed by white-pink rings of fresh skin.
Fresh skin…
Still growing…
Healing…
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered. Mandri sprang back just as the man’s ruined head jerked up, tossing a spill of blood at Mandri’s feet. The poor man’s tongue twisted out of his yawning mouth as he tried in vain to grasp a wet breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs. He wheezed and gulped, his chest heaved against the rope of thorns, but in the end his eyes rolled back and his whole body went limp and quiet again.
“His very Spark is bound to the pole,” Elrahet explained. She seemed unable to look upon the pilgrim. “His body will die, and die, and die again.” Her bottom lip trembled as she fought to contain her rage. She swayed silently, boiling inside, and just as it seemed she were about to faint she stamped her cane into the ground and furiously proclaimed, “We leave at once!”
She hobbled back into the tower’s tunnel, mumbling curses along the way. Moto was the first to follow, then Ayram and Moteah. Mandri trailed them all eagerly, glad to be moving away from the obscenity.
Seb remained.
“Hol’ on,” she said, indignant. “We goin’ back!? How ‘bout the Greskalun?” She jabbed an open hand towards the dark rent in the mountains behind, as if the Greskalun were right there and the others only had to squint to see them.
“There are no Greskalun,” Moteah called back.
“Ya don’t know that! They could be hidin’ up at Shulgi. They could be waitin’ for us to come an—”
Her words were cut short by the sight of the open desert. There, the sprawling tumble of the Goree’s shattered stones were being trampled underfoot by a white horse bearing a blue-robed rider. Behind them, emerging from their dust, was a column of white robed soldiers marching in even squares.
Then came a sharp and roaring bleat—the Hrkan horn of war.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommm

Bouncing in the blue-robed rider’s lap was a shorter figure wrapped in black. 
A Riga child.
“RUN!” Ayram roared, and if that wasn’t enough to prod Mandri into motion, the Mazidariga’s warbling whistle pierced the air.
He turned and tried to run as the whistling pitched into a mind splitting squeal. He collapsed to his knees, cowered against the sound, and he prayed a broken prayer between gasps as he felt his breath begin to leave him. He choked and swallowed, then someone grabbed the scruff of his robe and lifted him off the ground. It was Ayram, hoping to flee, but before he could gather Mandri under his arm the Riga’s whistle pitched again, crescendoing into a tinny screech that sent Mandri into convulsions. 
Mandri’s stomach retched, his chest heaved, his head slumped back into the crook of Ayram’s arm as a dim gray cloud spewed out out his mouth. Ayram reached out to try and gather it, that he might stuff it back down Mandri’s throat, but the smoke only flowed between his fingers.
The whistling shifted again, higher still, and the cloud reformed as it zipped past Ayram’s ear. It flew through the tunnel, towards the horse and rider, leaving the rest of the Ayramun watching in helpless panic. All the while, the distant line of soldiers continued marching.
Moteah sprinted towards the gate, climbed an exposed flight of steps that led up to the gate’s winch, and threw her whole weight against the nearest lever. The whole contraption failed to budge.
“Let them come,” Moto said, employing a mad grin. “This is good!” he bellowed as he drew his sword and punched at the tower’s bricks with the its pommel. After a few swift strokes the brick’s mortar was crumbling off in chunks. “You see!? The whole tower is ready to come down. They’ve stumbled into another Minting Rock and we should encourage it! We will take the Riga as easy as before.”
“Idiot!” Seb cried. “Of all the pokes in the world…we need to run!”
“Run where?” Moto countered.
“To the Greskalun! They’ll help!”
Seb set her pleading eyes on Ayram, looking for leadership.
Ayram looked to Elrahet.
The old witch stood silent at the side of the tunnel, bracing herself against the tower black. She stared intently at the desert, as if noticing the details and logging them. She was, Mandri knew, beholding the scene. While beholding is not a lossless art, if the eye is practiced, what gets lost has chance of being reconstructed later. At least, that was the hope. In truth it was all a fantasy, this artist’s noticing, this lover’s noticing, noticing to remember. That woman there was living in the moment so that in the future she could dwell in a fictitious past, one which centered herself and neglected to account for the private lives of anyone not in view. That included most of the world. And that included Mandri. Ayram tossed him aside, and his sudden thump against ground would be forgotten by everyone but himself.
He lay there, fly-swatted, struggling terribly against a renewed urge to breathe as well as the niggling thought that perhaps—perhaps—the scene splayed out before him was worth painting, regardless of the lies it would contain. There was something about the spike of the tower’s shadow. It was full of subtle, sumptuous grays that seemed purplish blue when set against the sunlit sand. People ought to know about them. And there was the northern wind flicking little spindrifts off the sloping backs of boulders. Then came the Hrkan horse, splendid white, white as Solraheen. A healthy creature, it’s brushed muscles furrowed and bulged as it charged towards the tower. It’s richly braided tail fluttered behind, and the scribe’s blue robe was resplendent even as his legs flapped against the saddle, his heels urging the beast onwards. Together with the Riga they rode right up to the tower’s shadow, and there the horse came to a shuffling stop before rearing up, almost to the point of no control. The staging here was perfect, for the warm spectral edge of the tower's penumbra cut right across the Riga child’s neck.
Fitted in to the sand behind them was that white line of Hrkan soldiers, marching at pace. It would take a large canvas to do them justice. Mandri twinged at the thought having to fill so large a frame. Perhaps it wasn’t worth painting after all.
Then the scribe unsheathed a sword and raised it high. He held it high as he calmed his horse, and when the beast was settled, he let that sword slip from its high perch and it fell blade-first into the sand.
“He wants to bargain?” Moto asked, awestruck.
Seb uncoiled, “It’s a trick!”
Elrahet loomed large in the foreground, a cowled figure draped in shadow. Ayram, his leg a giant bar in Mandri’s periphery, broker her concentration with a question. His deep, resonant voice carried like the echo of a drum.
“Do you see a path?”
Elrahet nodded, though her neck stiffened, as if resisting the motion. That, and the twitching crick in the corner of her lip betrayed a great reluctance. No doubt she beheld dark tidings in that line of Hrkan men, and yet, permission was given to treat with them.
Ayram swung his great pack off his shoulders. The straps creaked, and the heavy load hit the stone floor with a thud, scattering a fine layer of dust right into Mandri’s face. By the time Mandri could see clearly again, the white horse was half prancing in a deliberate trot towards the tower. The scribe was alone in the saddle. The Riga child had dismounted and was standing back.
Both the horse and scribe kept their chins tilted high as they approached the tower’s gate. If the scribe was perturbed by the sight of a giant wielding an iron spear, he did not show it. He rode with the bearing of a practical man, and he had the face of a true believer, stressed by the sun but unbothered by doubt. His face was scrunched into a serious glare, but underneath, Mandri saw naturally jolly features—round, unworried eyes, and round cheeks. A thick headscarf was sat back on his head, letting a tuft of black hair shower out. The scarf was so fat that it folded his fatty ears out and down, making them look a bit like little wings. This gave his head the appearance of taking flight, as if it were straining to lift off from the plinth that was his beard.
“It is good that you have given up the chase,” he said with a voice sharp and intelligent. His nose flared as he pulled his horse to heel, and he sniffed that elevated air of authority. “It is known that when you try to draw up water you cannot reach, you become weak.”
Ayram brandished his spear, remembering its weight.
“Not that you’re wanting for strength,” the scribe added. His eyes swept over Ayram as if sizing up a slave. He smiled, and graciously gave Ayram room to speak, but Ayram simply stood there in defiance.
The scribe glanced over his own shoulder, towards the distant ranks of his onrushing army. The glint of their spears and the slow churn of their glorious white banner brought a flicker of confidence to his eye.
“I am here to inform you of the consequences of your actions,” he said, turning his attention again to Ayram. “I won’t bother you with a lecture. The Mazid in your possession once belonged to the Lordship. You stole it. You are to suffer for that crime. I am supposed to tell you that cooperation will bring you benefit, but…” His lips tightened into a pained smile, as if admitting the low dignity of his office. “I know you think that you should resist, that surrender will not wear you well, but—”
 Ayram grunted in amusement.
“I don’t doubt that you could make things difficult,” The scribe said honestly. “You could vanish into these mountains. You might fight until you break. But believe when I say that you should deal with me rather than someone else.”
He paused again to encourage Ayram to speak, but it was the sound of Elrahet’s cane which broke the silence—a lurching tap-tap against the tunnel’s stone floor. The scribe’s face hardened as his eyes outlined her crooked silhouette swaying through the shadow.
Elrahet’s voice scratched at the ears.
“What is your name, Hrkman?”
The scribe’s red brow furrowed. He straightened in his saddle, and his grip tightened on the reins. “For our purposes, I have no name. I am here to represent the Lordship.”
Elrahet gave a heavy sigh, then leaned heavy on her cane, her knotted hands curling around its knotted handle. “I have dealt with your Lords and their littler Lords,” she said. “Here, now, I will deal with you.”
“I believe you have misread the situation,” the scribe countered. “This is not a negotiation. You will surrender, and then I will decide what to do with you.”
“Do you not wear scribal robes?”
“I do,” he said, shoulders squaring. “But it is not my duty to—”
“Are you not sworn to protect your Lordship?”
“With every breath.”
“Then breathe deeply, Hrkman, for your Lordship’s fate rests in my hand.”
The scribe’s beard spread into a appreciative smile. He peered into the darkness of the tunnel as if expecting to recognize Elrahet to be an old friend.
“If you are referring to the Mazid in your possession,” he said, “then you are twice mistaken. The Mazid has been defeated, and so it is of little concern. It will be disposed of. The rest of you, you have lives ahead of you. If you can believe it.”
“I do not speak of the Mazid.”
“Please, I know your kind—if you had any leverage, you’d be using it, not threating to use it. Abuse of power is in your nature, as a witch. You cannot help yourselves.”
“And what is your nature?”
“I reflect the Lordship.”
“Come then,” Elrahet said as she stepped aside. “Come and lay the light of the Lordship onto a land which has never seen it.”
The scribe shifted in his saddle. “I’m not sure I understand your proposal.”
“There is something you must see, that you may be informed of the consequences of your actions.”
The scribe’s smile grew wider, and before he could work through it, Elrahet pressed on.
“Are you not curious as to why we stole your Mazid?” she asked. “Did you ever wonder where we were going, or, what will happen, now that you’ve stopped us?”
“It hardly matters, does it?”
“And yet,” said Elrahet, frowning. “There is something I could show you.”
“This ‘thing’ you wish to show me, it threatens Lordship?”
“It does,” said Elrahet nodding. “So, come! Do not be frightened, Hrkman. Does the light of the Lordship not protect you still?”
The scribe twisted in his saddle and looked for his strength in the army marching behind him, but the sight of that line of spears no longer seemed to lift him.
“Come!” Elrahet beckoned.
Mandri saw a glint of gold sparkle at her side—there was that dreaded knife in her hand when it was not there before. Her robes fluttered, and as fast as the golden blade appeared, it lashed out at the empty air, then vanished.
The act was fleeting, but enough. Whether it was magic or mere distracting motion, the scribe’s attention snapped back to her as though she’d shouted his name.
“What is it you want to show me?” he asked.
Ayram answered, voice steady and commanding.
“A great evil dwells in these mountains. We were meant to kill it. Now that you’ve interrupted us, that evil is a threat to all.”
“That’s why you stole the Mazid? To go on a hunt? Not likely.”
“The truth lies beyond the tunnel.”
Ayram pointed with his spear, but the scribe only rolled his eyes and said impatiently, “I’ll ask again—what is it you want to show me?”
“Scourged pilgrims.”
The scribe’s face darkened at this blasphemous pairing of words. He leaned forward, and he peered now into the dark of the tunnel, and instead of bouncing his suspicion between the weatherbeaten Ayramun, he looked right past them. Something in the sunlight on the other side must have caught his notice, a flash of a yellow haircloth habit perhaps, for his eyes flared and he urged his horse forward.
He rode through the tunnel without regard for his own safety. The Ayramun could have set themselves upon him with ease. Mandri could not place him until he caught Mandri’s eye, and there in shadow of his brow was a righteous fury. His gaze lingered for only a moment, for it was pulled by the courtyard’s brightness, there at once the horror was upon him.
This man, younger than his grooming might suggest, wore the exact same look Mandri wore when he saw his first masterpiece—stunned surprise, then awe, then came the quenching of a heretofore unnoticed thirst as the majesty of the work began to reveal answers to questions he’d never thought to ask.
On instinct, the scribe spurred his horse forward, and though the horse tossed its head, distressed by its rider’s cue, it pressed on.
And yes, majesty can be terrifying. And those pilgrim poles were indeed a masterpiece, for what is a masterpiece but the realization of undreamt possibility? A masterwork forces confronts a person with their own ignorance—did the pilgrim poles not do this?
Now that Mandri was seeing through this lens, a truer horror began to settle in, for where before he saw unreason and carnage, he saw now a calculating mind. Every cut, every aching wound was a conscious decision, all of it meant to bring the—
“Damn you!” The scribe screamed. It wasn’t clear if the words were for his fidgeting horse, who threated to unseat him, for the perpetrators of the crime, who were no doubt destined for Shis already, or for Mandri, whose thoughts were straying dangerously close to heresy.
Of course, Mandri knew the scribe could not possibly understand the moment in this way. That man on his mount moved before this field of torture like some overgrown rat, hesitant to get too close, confused by a world too large for him. When he swiveled in his saddle to look for Elrahet, it seemed as if he’d gone mad.
“What is this!?” he demanded, voice brittle with rage.
Elrahet, respectful, stepped out of the shadow, though she did not speak. Her silence unsettled the scribe even further.
—-
Until Elrahet finally spoke.
“What is you’re name, Hrkman?”
“Pyetle,” the scribe muttered, forgetting his earlier reservations.
“Py-etle,” Elrahet said, playing with the sounds. “Your name stands now on the spine of a history book. Your next choice will fill the pages.” 
Pyetle squirmed in his saddle and regarded Elrahet with plain derision.
“You expect me to listen to you? I find a witch next to a witch’s work and you expect me to believe you had nothing to do with this!?”
“If not a witch,” said Elrahet, “Who else?”
“Indeed! Who else!? Who—”
Pyetle turned again to the pilgrim poles as if struck by a revelation. But this was short-lived, and he visibly sank into confusion.
“Who sees its own shadow and cries in fright?” said Elrahet. “Who lingers in darkness and shuns the light?”
 “Demons!?” Pyetle exclaimed. His horse reared as though the word had nipped its ankle. Pyetle struggled to calm both himself and his mount, but when it was done, some semblance of order came to him, and his eyes darted from the poles to Elrahet, to the Ayramun, to Mandri.  
“I suppose you want me to let you go?” he said. “I should leave you to your righteous hunt?”
“First, you must return the Mazid’s breath to his body”
“Why would I ever do that?”
“Someone must kill the beast that did this.”
Pyetle looked again upon the pilgrims, and this steeled his nerves. He kicked his horse hard and shouted, “Hee-AH!”
His yell startled the horse out of its private, and it leaped into the tunnel. The scribe leaned low against its neck as the magnificent creature galloped under the gate and out into the mouth of the Goree Pass.
The Ayramun watched with bated breath as Pyetle exchanged words with the captain of the Hrkan army. When the Scribe returned, he was flanked by escort of spears.
“If night falls and we have not found sign of a great demon, you will be held accountable for this sacrilege.”
He spoke to all.
“Blow your horn,” Ayram said. “Best let them know we are coming.”

        <Title>Maybe real ixnay Riga</Title>
        <Text>The story of the creation of the Goree Pass is a simple story. An ancient tribe, called the Solgruin, petitioned Solraheen to split the Goree mountains so that they might profit from an overland route to the east. Solraheen denied them. He did not want to destroy any part of His creation for any reason, much less to accommodate trade. The next year, the Solgruin asked again, and again they were denied. They waited another year to ask again, on the off chance that Solraheen, the god of all creation, might change His mind. On the sixth asking, Solraheen lost His patience. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak, and there He stomped on the Goree’s back and broke it. Thus, a great fissure was opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.
Then he spoke a curse into the chasm.
The words he spoke were heard by every ear in all the world, no matter how far.
“Look upon this scar which mars My creation. This mountain impeded your ways, so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, as is its beauty. Cursed are you who pass through it.”
Mandri loved this story. Solraheen ripped up one of His greatest works just to spite a client who requested an alteration. Mandri himself had ripped up a painting once, and what a glorious once it was. He’d spent a whole month and a small fortune painting this particular painting. The subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the Outland Prince Huldoloon. The client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn’t some clever metaphorical bent—the client wanted Mandri to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would walk through her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by barbarians on a richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a coiled curtain rope and say, “That looks just like your Googum!”, and the woman would say, “That’s because it is my Googum!”
Mandri could have found a different buyer, but no, he tore the painting completely in half. He did it right in front of that bumbling woman. The shock and horror on her face as he clawed out the staples on the frame to really rip thing full was cathartic. Then her voice pitched up into the hysterics.
“What is wrong with you!?”
Mandri would have cursed her, but he never learned any words of power because the Goree Pass proved that curses were ineffective on people who needed to be cursed. Solraheen stood atop the Goree and said, “Cursed are you who pass through it,” and people passed through it. These people argued that Solraheen’s ‘you’ was an exclusive ‘you’, referring only to the Solgruin. If Solraheen had meant to curse everyone, then surely He would have said, “Cursed are all who pass through it.” Since He didn’t say that, people made the pass without a care, and most of them went on to live happy, fulfilling lives, which was an injustice.
Solraheen didn’t rip up the Goree for the Solgruin alone, he ripped it up for everyone. The curse should apply evenly to everyone. What twist of logic defeated this, Mandri didn’t know. It couldn’t be that, if someone could convince themselves that they were free from words of power, then they were.
Mandri ventured south in the cold shadow of the Goree mountains, lagging a behind the Ayramun, for he was busy trying to convince himself that towering mountains to his left had no eye for him. There were a thousand staggered plateaus up there, blocking the morning light. They looked like squat redoubts, each a link in a fortress chain built by Solraheen to hold back the winds which swept the Tib, which lined the horizon to the right. Naturally, the further south he walked, the clearer Solraheen’s curse became. The massive rock faces grew more worn and pitted with every step. Higher up, they were beset by jagged, fern-like cracks whose stems stretched all the way down to the ground. An eon of blasting sand had rounded down the edges, pillowed the seams, giving these mountain cheeks the appearance of being bloated with infection.
Mandri reminded himself that the story of the Pass was only a story. Anyone could have made it up.  Besides, people actually lived in the Pass. The Greskalun lived in it. According to the story, the Greskalun were an Old Jandri tribe who were charged with keeping the pass free from the Solgruin. But the Solgruin had ceased to exist centuries ago, and the Greskalun were still there.
Soon, the Pass itself was sighted; a shadowed, sloping cut in a distant plateau. A black needle poked straight up out of it. This needle was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the narrow breadth of the Pass. It protected against ancient evils. It was the Greskalun’s home.
Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering they were wandering through the debris field of a cataclysmic explosion. The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been impossible to believe if it weren’t Solraheen who’d done it. Mandri imagined Him standing up high on a now vanished peak, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his rainbowed rays filtering through the swirling dust. A god such as He wouldn’t need to strike the earth to split it. It would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt and the whole vigor of creation would start to stir. A tap of His toe could set the mountains quaking, and out would come a torrent of stones the size of houses. The whole pass, that long sliver of the mountain, might have parted itself into rubble at the snap of His finger.
The Ayramun walked in reverential silence. Even Ayram kept his chin low, though this pious bend could be attributed to the strain of his giant pack and the long journey bearing on him.
Moteah’s face was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes took in the scale of it all.
There was a spring in Moto’s step, as if his feet had found their home.
Elrahet was the same as she’d always been—brooding and quiet.
Mandri was marching behind Seb, who was chewing her borcandi spines so hard that her jaw was going stiff. She had to sort of roll the spines between her stubby teeth instead of chew them. And she wasn’t paying attention to where she was spitting her juice. Halfway up a light scramble up to a shelf of rock, she hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto’s heel above her.
“Do that again,” Moto said, “And you’ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.”
Seb lifted herself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing stare. “Jus’ try an’ disrespect me like that,” said Seb. 
“Me, disrespect you?”
“Threaten a woman with her own kneecaps? Downright disrespectful.”
“You spit on my foot.”
“An accident.”
“I’m telling you, if you do it again, I’m going to—”
“Quiet!” Ayram barked. He was so irritated with the two of them that he doubled back. “Nobody talk. Nobody except me.”
They all stood still until Moto’s complaining shoulder’s settled down, and Seb swallowed her spit. Then Ayram set off again towards the Pass, this time more cautiously, crouching, trying to hide his bulk behind upright shards of stone.
Stands of rock were scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. They were each as friable as the hardtack Mandri was munching on. Their bases crushed easily underfoot. The mountain itself was no different; when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against the mountain’s foot, his palm punched a dent in it, as if the stone were nothing but the moldy crust of a hollowed out bread loaf. And then there was the black tower which poked out of the Pass like a splinter stuck in a wound. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy—nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on a flat frontier was the only legitimate use of a tower.
The only redeeming quality of the Goree’s tower was its monumental significance. The central task of a monument is to look like it doesn’t belong, and that tall spike sticking out of the Pass did this quite admirably, marking a curse which should not have been.
It seemed to say, “You are going to die if you come any closer.”
This sensation was magnified by the brittle slopes which threatened to come galloping down upon Mandri’s head every time a lizard stirred from its nook. It wasn’t possible to keep away from these rocks as Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by the apparently invisible Hrkan pursuit some ways behind them to the north. He pioneered a course that led up into crumbling mountains. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track them with a Riga, but he didn’t ask.
He kept quiet because that was the rule.
Everyone kept quiet.
Whatever cheer they’d mustered from making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding their hopeful allies, the Greskalun. There was no sign of them, not until they came into the mouth of the Pass.
The great black tower stood proudly, right in the middle of it. Stubby black walls filled the short gaps on either side of it. There was no sign of any people, no trickle of caravan hands passing into the tower’s gate at its base, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower’s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners hanging on poles or smelly black smoke from dung fires rising into the air. It seemed, at first glance, that something had happened to the Greskalun.
Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off into the tower’s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.
Seb broke the rule of silence with a whisper. “Maybe ‘ey all lef’, wen’ back to tha Shulgi.” Her words were garbled by a slosh of spit. She was so stressed out that she was chewing two spines at once. 
“Retreated?” Moteah asked. “From what?”
“Don’t ask me,” Seb said defensively.
“Maybe it's pox,” said Mandri.
Seb’s eyes went bright with revelation. “Could be! Happen’ afore. That’s what these pokes do when pox gets on ‘em, they run away, then stay put ‘til it all blows over.”
“Then where’s the sign of fire?” Moteah asked. “If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could.” 
“Then it might be the curse,” Seb offered.
“It is not cursed,” said Ayram with all the assurance of a big man who knows. “Greskal and his kin have been living here since—”, but he was interrupted by the sight of a black vulture melting out of the tower’s pointed roof. It squawked as it took flight.
They all watched the creature spread its long wings and ride a thermal high up into the air, where it wheeled in circles.
“Only a bird,” Ayram muttered.
Two more vultures melted out of the tower’s shadow and soared up to join their brother’s holding pattern. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri’s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn’t know any better, he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen’s ancient words of power.
It was Moteah’s turn to say it.
“The place is cursed.”
“If curses worked,” said Ayram, “Then the Hrks would have choked in their sleep a thousand years ago.”
The giant tried to maintain his stoic self but the mood was affecting even him, which was perfectly understandable, for the strongest men have the most to lose from a curse. It wasn’t something he could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion that everything was going according to plan.
He marched over to Mandri, clenched jaw and all, and loomed as large as the empty tower behind his shoulder.
“Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?” he asked.
There was no room in his tone for games.
“No?” Mandri answered, confused.
“When we found you in the Junei, you had come from the east. Did you come from here?”
“No…If you are asking me if there’s an army of Skusli waiting behind those walls to ambush us as soon as we step through that gate, I have no idea.”
Seb cleared her throat of spit and said, “No way it was Hrks. I’m tellin’ ya, them Greskalun are at Shulgi. Pox, Hrks, drought, it don’t matter—when things go bad for ‘em, they run to Shulgi. That’s what they do.”
“Might be,” Moteah said, doubtfully.
Elrahet grumbled at both women, and instead of explaining she reached down and grabbed a bone that was half buried in the dirt. She set the bone out before her, so that all could see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle. Distinctively human.
“A sign of the Greskalun,” she growled. “They are dead.”
Seb stomped over and nudged the bone with her toe. “Ya find one bone and think em dead? One bone?”
“It shouldn’t be here.”
“Where else ya expect to find it, but the ground? Find it floatin’ in the air an maybe we got somethin’.”
“Let her speak,” said Ayram.
Elrahet squatted next the bone and turned it over.
“Here’s an unusual fracture, no?”
She stroked the length of the bone’s fracture with a thin finger. It was a jagged feature which stretched along the whole length of the bone, leaving the upturned half looking like an open tube.
“It's a broken bone,” Seb said, unfazed.
“It’s a split bone. Splitting a bone lengthwise like this is difficult. If it were snapped in two like a dead twig, that could be expected. A break such as this…it’s not likely to have been an accident.”
She held it up for Ayram to inspect. He took it, and in his giant, probing hands the bone looked like a child’s. “Are you claiming this person was killed?” he asked. “That’s not unusual.”
“A blow to the leg,” Elrahet said, “would not crack a bone lengthwise. This is different. This, I’ve seen before in an Old Jandri ruin…a long dead tribe. Too many of people and not enough bread…It wasn’t lizards that split those bones. It wasn’t dogs—they don’t have the hands for it.” She pointed a gnarled finger at that dreadful broken bone. “That is the fracture a madman makes when he hungers for the spongy marrow.”
Mandri’s mind ran awash with a vision of some sand-crusted cannibal gnawing on that bone as if it were a chicken leg. Strings of fat and tendons were getting caught in the gaps of his filed teeth.
Ayram held the bone away as if it were diseased. Elrahet plucked it from his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone into dirt. When it landed, Moteah shouted, “Look!”
She was pointing towards the tower’s gate. Moto was sprinting away from it. He sprinted at full speed, frenetic, as if being chased, yet he was alone with his kicked up dust.
When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for questions. He simply said to Ayram, “There is something you need to see.”
“The Greskalun?”
Moto shook his head.
“Hrks?”
“Forget about the Hrks. There’s something you need to see!”
He looked over his shoulder, towards the tower, and grimaced.
Ayram moved, and the matter was decided—he would lead them all into the Goree Pass.
At pace they came to the tower. It seemed sturdy from afar, but up close it was ancient and hobbled. It bulged ever so slightly outward. Most of its bricks were chipped, some were twisted, some were somehow pulled halfway out, as if suggesting a climb. It all seemed to about to crumble. 
They pressed on into the entrance mouth, which was ten-men wide with a drawn-up gate bearing metal fangs which would have scratched Ayram’s head if he did not duck. The tunnel beyond was perhaps fifty yards, cavernous enough to turn the thump of Ayram’s walking spear into an booming beat. Beside this steady meter, they passed through the shadow in silence, glancing into the empty doorways that pocketed either side.
Moto, who’d taken the lead, stopped before entering into the sunlight of the courtyard beyond. He looked back at all who followed, and a shadow of pain passed over his face.
Mandri’s black stomach churned into growling fit. He hurried out into the broad courtyard to get out from under the Tower’s oppression. There, the cobbled bricks were as old as the tower itself, grooved as they were down the middle by centuries of wagon wheels. All around them, stuck into the ground like an errant volley of arrows, were large wooden poles, each thick as a cow’s belly. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. 
A desecration.
Such was the defilement that panic leaped into Mandri’s mind as readily as the sight of the profane sculptures themselves. But he was rooted to the spot, for the horror robbed him of every faculty.
The nearest wretch was only ten yards away—a man who was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption; a devout Solitant pilgrim. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and seemingly boneless, lolled in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by the grace of Schisol.
Around the man’s neck was a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn’t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there, and he knew what it was—it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic. And that was the least of the indignities done to him. His broken scalp was crudely shaved, chunked, and bleeding. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were smeared with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful derision. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of thee poor pilgrims littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted with the same unthinking cruelty. They were all pilgrims. Maybe thirty of them—maybe there were fifty—to count would require the use of reason, and reason had abandoned this place. 
“What is this?” Mandri muttered, and for once, no one answered.
The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Seb, a woman who could not stand still, was standing as still as a dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. The witch Elrahet must have sensed this evil scene halfway through the tunnel, for she had not made it out into the courtyard. She kept herself there inside in the shadow, hunched over on an inset doorstep as if about to vomit.
Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever.
Moto said to him, “I thought you’d want to see for yourself.”
Ayram cast an appraising eye towards his mournful band. “I knew Greskal hated the Hrks,” he said. “I didn’t think he had this in him.”
His remark startled Seb back into her skin, and she said in turn, “Who cares if a few god-botherin’ Hrks got what was comin’ to ‘em? There’s nothin’ we can do for ‘em cuz we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin’!”
“And go where?” Moteah asked.
Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. “We go an find the Greskalun!”
“There are no Greskalun!” Moteah shouted.
“Then who did all this?” Seb asked as she gestured at the carnage. “I’m with Ayram. Greskal ain’t the only poke who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain’t one of ‘em.”
Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet’s worn-out grumble came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.
“Moteah’s right.”
Her sternness stunned them all back into silence, and Mandri, like everyone else, peered dumbly into the tunnel where the witch gave a rattling sigh, then she stood up as straight as her back allowed.
“Must have been the panic,” she said as she walked towards the courtyard. It seemed all her joints were aching, like every weary moment of the long journey was suddenly set upon her.
“Mere hate, no, that would not have been enough. The panic of the age—that’s what gets a stomach growling. Always does.”
She stepped into the light and surveyed the courtyard with a hateful glare.
“Can you sense it, Mazid? Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long you can’t tell it’s there?”
“I don’t know what you—”
“PANIC!” Elrahet shrieked. “Panic sets the stomach growling. Panic wakes it up.”
“Wakes what up?” Mandri asked.
Elrahet’s lip curled.
“The Burshageet.”
The graveled word zipped past Mandri’s ear like a rock aimed for his head, and he felt, somehow, like he’d just dodged another death. 
“Twas the Burshageet which did this,” she declared. “Before, or after, it ate the Greskalun.”
“We will do what we can for them,” Ayram said. “Then we leave.”
“We can do nothing to help these folk,” said Elrahet grimly.
Seb spat her agreement onto the courtyard brick and said flatly, “Dead is dead.”
“Oh, they are not dead.”
Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim. He’d seen enough of death to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been tortured beyond comprehension. There was no way he could still be alive.
On second glance the pilgrim’s wounds were quite peculiar. The strip of missing skin on the outside of his thigh was circumscribed by white-pink rings of fresh skin.
Fresh skin…
Still growing…
Healing…
Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim’s haircloth habit shuddered. Mandri sprang back just as the man’s ruined head jerked up, tossing a spill of blood at Mandri’s feet. The poor man’s tongue twisted out of his yawning mouth as he tried in vain to grasp a wet breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs. He wheezed and gulped, his chest heaved against the rope of thorns, but in the end his eyes rolled back and his whole body went limp and quiet again.
“His very Spark is bound to the pole,” Elrahet explained. She seemed unable to look upon the pilgrim. “His body will die, and die, and die again.” Her bottom lip trembled as she fought to contain her rage. She swayed silently, boiling inside, and just as it seemed she were about to faint she stamped her cane into the ground and furiously proclaimed, “We leave at once!”
She hobbled back into the tower’s tunnel, mumbling curses along the way. Moto was the first to follow, then Ayram and Moteah. Mandri trailed them all eagerly, glad to be moving away from the obscenity.
Seb remained.
“Hol’ on,” she said, indignant. “We goin’ back!? How ‘bout the Greskalun?” She jabbed an open hand towards the dark rent in the mountains behind, as if the Greskalun were right there and the others only had to squint to see them.
“There are no Greskalun,” Moteah called back.
“Ya don’t know that! They could be hidin’ up at Shulgi. They could be waitin’ for us to come an—”
Her words were cut short by the sight of the open desert. There, the sprawling tumble of the Goree’s shattered stones were being trampled underfoot by a white horse bearing a blue-robed rider. Bouncing in the rider’s lap was a shorter figure wrapped in black—a Riga child. Behind them, emerging from the dusty haze, was a column of white robed soldiers marching in even squares.
Then came that sharp and roaring bleat of the Hrkan horn of war.

BWEEEEEEEEEEEEooooooooooooooooooommm

Moteah sprinted towards the gate and climbed an exposed staircase that led up to the gate’s winch. She kicked around up there, looking for a latch to unlock, but nothing budged—the gate did not drop.
“Let them come,” Moto said, employing a maniacal grin. He punched at the tower with the side of his fist and a chunk of mortar snapped off. “This thing is ready to fall,” he said. “They’ve stumbled into another Minting Rock. We’ll take them as easily as before!”
“Fool!” Seb cried. “We got to find the Greskalun!”
Seb set her pleading eyes on Ayram, looking for leadership, but he hadn’t heard a word. He was, instead, standing next to Mandri and looking down. There was a gleam in his dark eye which suggested ill intent.
“I won’t help you kill those men,” Mandri said.
Ayram grunted, then back-handed Mandri’s jaw.
A molar went flying out of Mandri’s mouth, like that piece of the tower’s mortar. Such was the force of the blow that his whole body seemed to follow that spinning tooth through the air, and when he landed flat, it was sitting in front of his nose.
 “Moteah!” Ayram shouted. His deep voice carried through the tunnel, and Moteah came running back. She hadn’t heard Mandri’s refusal, but she could guess it well enough when she saw him fly-swatted on the ground.
“If he doesn’t want to breathe the fire,” she said, “it won’t work.”
Ayram towered over her. “Make it work.”
“Leave her be,” Elrahet grumbled. She stood halfway inside the tunnel, back turned, watching the Hrkan advance with an impatient glare. The whole world, it seemed, was running well behind her schedule. 
Mandri looked out upon the Goree plain and saw something odd about the spike of the tower’s shadow. It was full of subtle, sumptuous grays that seemed purplish blue, almost painted in. And there, too, was the northern wind flicking little spindrifts off the sloping backs of boulders. There was the Hrkan horse, splendid white, white as Solraheen, a healthy creature with brushed muscles that furrowed and bulged as it charged towards the tower. It’s richly braided tail fluttered behind, and its rider’s blue robe was resplendent even as his legs flapped against the saddle. The Riga was no longer there in his lap; he rode alone. He rode right up to the tower’s shadow, and there he pulled the horse to a thunderous stop. The beast reared up, almost to the point of no control, letting the cold spectral edge of the tower's penumbra cut right across its stomach.
The staging was perfect—Mandri would have thought it artificial if he wasn’t watching it happen with his own eyes. And there, fitted in to the sand behind, was that white line of Hrkan soldiers, marching at pace. It would take a large canvas to do them justice.
The scribe unsheathed a sword and raised it high. He held it there while he calmed his horse, and when the beast was settled, he dropped the sword and it fell blade-first into the sand.
“He wants to bargain?” Moto asked, awestruck.
“He knows he can’t fight a Mazid,” Moteah answered.
Seb uncoiled, “It’s a trick!”
“Is this the path?” Ayram asked of Elrahet. The old witch nodded, though her neck stiffened, as if resisting the motion.
“You will treat with him,” She said, and she went silent.
Ayram swung his great pack off of his shoulders. The straps creaked, and the heavy load hit the brick floor with a thud, scattering a fine layer of dust right into Mandri’s face. By the time Mandri had finished wiping his eyes, the white Hrkan horse was trotting towards the gate.
Both the horse and scribe kept their chins tilted high as they approached. If the scribe was perturbed by the sight of a giant wielding an iron spear, he did not show it. He rode with the bearing of a practical man, and he had the face of a true believer, stressed by the sun but unbothered by doubt. His face was scrunched into a serious glare, but underneath, Mandri saw naturally jolly features—round, unworried eyes, and round cheeks. A thick headscarf was sat back on his head, letting a tuft of black hair shower out. The scarf was so fat that it folded his fatty ears out and down, making them look a bit like little wings. This gave his head the appearance of taking flight, as if it were straining to lift off from the plinth that was his beard.
“It is good that you have given up the chase,” he said with a voice sharp and intelligent. His nose flared as he pulled his horse to heel, and he sniffed that elevated air of authority. “It is known that when you try to draw up water you cannot reach, you become weak.”
Ayram brandished his spear, remembering its weight.
“Not that you’re wanting for strength,” the scribe added. His eyes swept over Ayram as if sizing up a slave. He smiled, and graciously gave Ayram room to speak, but Ayram simply stood there in defiance.
The scribe glanced over his own shoulder, towards the distant ranks of his onrushing army. The glint of their spears and the slow churn of their glorious white banner brought a flicker of confidence to his eye.
“I am here to inform you of the consequences of your actions,” he said, turning his attention again to Ayram. “I won’t bother you with a lecture. The Mazid in your possession once belonged to the Lordship. You stole it. You are to suffer for that crime. I am supposed to tell you that cooperation will bring you benefit, but…” His lips tightened into a pained smile, as if admitting the low dignity of his office. “I know you think that you should resist, that surrender will not wear you well, but—”
 Ayram grunted in amusement.
“I don’t doubt that you could make things difficult,” The scribe said honestly. “You could vanish into these mountains. You might fight until you break. But believe when I say that you should deal with me rather than someone else.”
He paused again to encourage Ayram to speak, but it was the sound of Elrahet’s cane which broke the silence—a lurching tap-tap against the tunnel’s stone floor. The scribe’s face hardened as his eyes outlined her crooked silhouette swaying through the shadow.
Elrahet’s voice scratched at the ears.
“What is your name, Hrkman?”
The scribe’s red brow furrowed. He straightened in his saddle, and his grip tightened on the reins. “For our purposes, I have no name. I am here to represent the Lordship.”
Elrahet gave a heavy sigh, then leaned heavy on her cane, her knotted hands curling around its knotted handle. “I have dealt with your Lords and their littler Lords,” she said. “Here, now, I will deal with you.”
“I believe you have misread the situation,” the scribe countered. “This is not a negotiation. You will surrender, and then I will decide what to do with you.”
“Do you not wear scribal robes?”
“I do,” he said, shoulders squaring. “But it is not my duty to—”
“Are you not sworn to protect your Lordship?”
“With every breath.”
“Then breathe deeply, Hrkman, for your Lordship’s fate rests in my hand.”
The scribe’s beard spread into a appreciative smile. He peered into the darkness of the tunnel as if expecting to recognize Elrahet to be an old friend.
“If you are referring to the Mazid in your possession,” he said, “then you are twice mistaken. The Mazid has been defeated, and so it is of little concern. It will be disposed of. The rest of you, you have lives ahead of you. If you can believe it.”
“I do not speak of the Mazid.”
“Please, I know your kind—if you had any leverage, you’d be using it, not threating to use it. Abuse of power is in your nature, as a witch. You cannot help yourselves.”
“And what is your nature?”
“I reflect the Lordship.”
“Come then,” Elrahet said as she stepped aside. “Come and lay the light of the Lordship onto a land which has never seen it.”
The scribe shifted in his saddle. “I’m not sure I understand your proposal.”
“There is something you must see, that you may be informed of the consequences of your actions.”
The scribe’s smile grew wider, and before he could work through it, Elrahet pressed on.
“Are you not curious as to why we stole your Mazid?” she asked. “Did you ever wonder where we were going, or, what will happen, now that you’ve stopped us?”
“It hardly matters, does it?”
“And yet,” said Elrahet, frowning. “There is something I could show you.”
“This ‘thing’ you wish to show me, it threatens Lordship?”
“It does,” said Elrahet nodding. “So, come! Do not be frightened, Hrkman. Does the light of the Lordship not protect you still?”
The scribe twisted in his saddle and looked for his strength in the army marching behind him, but the sight of that line of spears no longer seemed to lift him.
“Come!” Elrahet beckoned.
Mandri saw a glint of gold sparkle at her side—there was that dreaded knife in her hand when it was not there before. Her robes fluttered, and as fast as the golden blade appeared, it lashed out at the empty air, then vanished.
The act was fleeting, but enough. Whether it was magic or mere distracting motion, the scribe’s attention snapped back to her as though she’d shouted his name.
“What is it you want to show me?” he asked.
Ayram answered, voice steady and commanding.
“A great evil dwells in these mountains. We were meant to kill it. Now that you’ve interrupted us, that evil is a threat to all.”
“That’s why you stole the Mazid? To go on a hunt? Not likely.”
“The truth lies beyond the tunnel.”
Ayram pointed with his spear, but the scribe only rolled his eyes and said impatiently, “I’ll ask again—what is it you want to show me?”
“Scourged pilgrims.”
The scribe’s face darkened at this blasphemous pairing of words. He leaned forward, and he peered now into the dark of the tunnel, and instead of bouncing his suspicion between the weatherbeaten Ayramun, he looked right past them. Something in the sunlight on the other side must have caught his notice, a flash of a yellow haircloth habit perhaps, for his eyes flared and he urged his horse forward.
He rode through the tunnel without regard for his own safety. The Ayramun could have set themselves upon him with ease. Mandri could not place him until he caught Mandri’s eye, and there in shadow of his brow was a righteous fury. His gaze lingered for only a moment, for it was pulled by the courtyard’s brightness, there at once the horror was upon him.
This man, younger than his grooming might suggest, wore the exact same look Mandri wore when he saw his first masterpiece—stunned surprise, then awe, then came the quenching of a heretofore unnoticed thirst as the majesty of the work began to reveal answers to questions he’d never thought to ask.
On instinct, the scribe spurred his horse forward, and though the horse tossed its head, distressed by its rider’s cue, it pressed on.
And yes, majesty can be terrifying. And those pilgrim poles were indeed a masterpiece, for what is a masterpiece but the realization of undreamt possibility? A masterwork forces confronts a person with their own ignorance—did the pilgrim poles not do this?
Now that Mandri was seeing through this lens, a truer horror began to settle in, for where before he saw unreason and carnage, he saw now a calculating mind. Every cut, every aching wound was a conscious decision, all of it meant to bring the—
“Damn you!” The scribe screamed. It wasn’t clear if the words were for his fidgeting horse, who threated to unseat him, for the perpetrators of the crime, who were no doubt destined for Shis already, or for Mandri, whose thoughts were straying dangerously close to heresy.
Of course, Mandri knew the scribe could not possibly understand the moment in this way. That man on his mount moved before this field of torture like some overgrown rat, hesitant to get too close, confused by a world too large for him. When he swiveled in his saddle to look for Elrahet, it seemed as if he’d gone mad.
“What is this!?” he demanded, voice brittle with rage.
Elrahet, respectful, stepped out of the shadow, though she did not speak. Her silence unsettled the scribe even further.
—-
Until Elrahet finally spoke.
“What is you’re name, Hrkman?”
“Pyetle,” the scribe muttered, forgetting his earlier reservations.
“Py-etle,” Elrahet said, playing with the sounds. “Your name stands now on the spine of a history book. Your next choice will fill the pages.” 
Pyetle squirmed in his saddle and regarded Elrahet with plain derision.
“You expect me to listen to you? I find a witch next to a witch’s work and you expect me to believe you had nothing to do with this!?”
“If not a witch,” said Elrahet, “Who else?”
“Indeed! Who else!? Who—”
Pyetle turned again to the pilgrim poles as if struck by a revelation. But this was short-lived, and he visibly sank into confusion.
“Who sees its own shadow and cries in fright?” said Elrahet. “Who lingers in darkness and shuns the light?”
 “Demons!?” Pyetle exclaimed. His horse reared as though the word had nipped its ankle. Pyetle struggled to calm both himself and his mount, but when it was done, some semblance of order came to him, and his eyes darted from the poles to Elrahet, to the Ayramun, to Mandri.  
“I suppose you want me to let you go?” he said. “I should leave you to your righteous hunt?”
“First, you must return the Mazid’s breath to his body”
“Why would I ever do that?”
“Someone must kill the beast that did this.”
Pyetle looked again upon the pilgrims, and this steeled his nerves. He kicked his horse hard and shouted, “Hee-AH!”
His yell startled the horse out of its private, and it leaped into the tunnel. The scribe leaned low against its neck as the magnificent creature galloped under the gate and out into the mouth of the Goree Pass.
The Ayramun watched with bated breath as Pyetle exchanged words with the captain of the Hrkan army. When the Scribe returned, he was flanked by escort of spears.
“If night falls and we have not found sign of a great demon, you will be held accountable for this sacrilege.”
He spoke to all.
“Blow your horn,” Ayram said. “Best let them know we are coming.”
