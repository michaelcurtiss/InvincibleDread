\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle was dismayed to see that even the light wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t show his assailaint, for the man was wrapped in black soccr cloth from head to toe. No hint skin showing, just cotton cloth, like a stuffed doll. No armor either. Not even a belt or bag tied to the waist. Rags tied off with thinner ribbons, and that was enough to define the form of a man.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle peered into the hood, and was dismayed to see that covering his face was a black veil.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Human being is not designed for contentment. It is designed to be unsatisfied. Cruel irony of the gods is that they gave the gift of imagination, and with it you imagine only how your life can be better. This drives you to seek better life, better position, more sustenance. That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what\u8217\'92s driven them to this! Consorting with demons!}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Throne room once carved into the earth like petra. But a great slab, tectonic plate, had shifted, so the whole room sat at angle, the lower right corner forming a gutter in which all manner of debris collected. So there was a flat path along it. Straight to the end of the hall, where a scaffold of stick and brick climbed up the far wall to an angled doorway.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Colmuns which once held the roof had tumbled down and blocked the way. Passages were carved through them. Strangely well kept. Ayram knew the way.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What is this place?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Dark, damp, chittering bats and creatures unspeakable. Odor? Cold Spring water.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At the end there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a set of stairs, which set sidways was a jagged wall. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This was the throne room of an old, old kingdom. A kingdom which once ruled over all of mankind.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram blows himself up to save the lives of the Ayramun from the cannibals.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re chased by empire, Ayram, in his flayed state, saves them again, but at great cost to himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram goes into a chamber, or passes out. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s muscle and sinew. Having just saved the lives the lives of teh Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pella sits the survivors down and is like, look. Ayram needs one you to donate.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram is dying. Commands pyetle to go through the door and fill this jar with blood. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle is like, the fuck?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram shouts, go!}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Green mist coming up through a crack in the floor. Same green mist that had pyetle intoxicated. Inhaled by the giant in the rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Head as wide as pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders. Unkempt hair and beard. Head lolling back. Exposed neck. Pulsing veins. Pyelte and mazyd venture in. What should I do? Better do what ayram asks. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle makes a cut on the shoulder, a little blood trickles out, but the wound closes and is healed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Interesting. Cut deeper.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle makes a deep cut, blooud pours into the bowl.}
