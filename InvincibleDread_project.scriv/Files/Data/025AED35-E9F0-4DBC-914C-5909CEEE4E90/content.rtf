\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Marx seems to have been fairly convinced of the Civil War's importance from its beginning -- writing to Engels in support of John Brown's rebellion in a letter of January 1861 ("In my opinion, the biggest things that are happening in the world today are... the movement of the slaves in America started by the death of John Brown" -- his other pick, for reference, was the action of Russian serfs)}{\f0\fs24\b0\super 1.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 As for the war itself, our most telling early source is his 11th October 1861 article in the\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 New York Tribune}{\f0\fs24\b0 . In Marx's view, he sees the Civil War as being purely one of Southern aggression against the North:}
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 "It ought to be remembered that it was not the North, but the South, which undertook this war; the former acting only on the defense... the North, after long hesitations, and an exhibition of forbearance unknown in the annals of European history, drew at last the sword..."}{\f0\fs24\b0\super 2}
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 The more pressing concern for Marx, who saw South-as-aggressor as self-evident, was in speaking against much public opinion in the British establishment of the time. Britain was keen to maintain trade with the Confederacy (evidenced later in the war by British blockade-runners attempting to sneak past the anaconda). British opinion at the time was anti-slavery, in line with the British Empire's policy, but at the same time its economic interests were high priority. Marx spends much of his 11th October article railing against London papers -- particularly the\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 Economist}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~and\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 Examiner}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~for being "anti-Northern" as he puts it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Marx was firm in his belief that the war was primarily one of slavery versus anti-slavery, and spoke out against perceived Confederate bias in the British press.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 As a side-note, Marx's views are not necessarily representative of left-wing British thought on the subject. Famously, the left-wing newspaper\~}{\f0\fs24\b0\i1 The Manchester Guardian}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~argued against the Union embargo, saying that its continuation was causing destitution and starvation amongst the now-redundant working class of Northern England's cloth mills; 60% of the labour force of Greater Manchester's mills had been made redundant because of the lack of Southern primary goods}{\f0\fs24\b0\super 3.}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~That said, a strong labour front within Manchester did meet at the Free Trade Hall in 1862, pledging support to Lincoln against the institution of slavery.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 Liverpool's dockhands and workers, who relied on the South for its economy (importing up to three-quarters of all Dixie's cotton in 1860), were both very left-wing and very supportive of the Confederacy -- "it was said that there were more Confederate flags flying along the banks of the Mersey than in Virginia"}{\f0\fs24\b0\super 4.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 On a more "intellectual left" side, the European focus on "wage slavery" made an impact on the debate on this side of the Atlantic. This is perhaps most evident in William Thomson, a Scottish weaver who travelled the US and Canada during the 1840s to see the state of labour on both sides of the Atlantic and bring home fresh ideas for helping the working men of his own country}{\f0\fs24\b0\super 5.}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~While he discussed the reality of slavery, including its harshness -- he mentions the execution of one slave for murder, where the slaves of his plantation and all neighbouring farms and plantations were called out to witness (and indeed assist) -- he praised the elements of the system which he saw as preferable to the "wage slavery" of Scotland at the time. He best summarises this thus:}
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 "Truth, then, compels me to say that the planters in general treat their slaves with great humanity. Would to God the aristocracy or the government of [Great Britain] would interest themselves half as much to improve the physical condition of the factory slave of England!"}
\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0 Thomson would go on to discuss his conversations with planters, and conclude that "some of the more moderate and reasonable did not pretend to defend slavery... How are they to get clear of it? No practicable plan has been proposed to them." For Thomson and those in his vein of left-wing thought, the benefits of having homes, food and medical care provided to slaves did a lot to mitigate the institution in their eyes}{\f0\fs24\b0\super 6.}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~To what extent the "wage slavery is worse than chattel slavery in some ways" argument held sway in popular sentiment amongst Liverpool's trade unions is debatable -- it seems more likely to have been in response to worsening local living conditions -- but it's worth knowing that a strand of British leftism was much more positive about the South than Marx.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b1 In short}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~Marx was engaged with London establishment debates around the Civil War, and dedicated to pushing the idea of Southern aggression as the dominant narrative of the war. Some work has claimed that he and Engels saw this as a class-revolution-by-proxy}{\f0\fs24\b0\super 7;}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~this is somewhat supported by evidence.\~}{\f0\fs24\b1 But}{\f0\fs24\b0 \~Marx's views were only one of many within left-wing British thought of the period, and placing him within that context of differing views probably offers more fertile ground for discussion than simply answering "what did he say about this?".}
