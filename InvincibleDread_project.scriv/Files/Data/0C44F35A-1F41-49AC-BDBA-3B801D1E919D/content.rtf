\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As the earth warmed, vast rivers fed by melting ice and heavy rains carved their way through the earlier sediments that had infilled the alluvial basin between the zagros mountains of iran and the arabian plateau. They dumped those sediments into the shatt al-arab valley, creating the floor of what is now the arab-persian gulf. Throughout the early holocene, even newer sediments then infilled those channel scours. For the most part, this re-leveled the basin floor. - in some places burying the earlier surface beneath tens of meteres of alluvial sands and silt;in others, leaving older remnants exposed, like turtles\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92 backs rising above the still waters of a pond. Over time, the interplay of tectonic uplift and subduction with rising and falling sea levels, rivers and floods, and windborne sand scouring its way across that silty plain shaped and reshaped optimal zones for a variety of biological activities.}

Between najaf and kut, it further twists west to east along an oblique fault zone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The combined outflows (euphrates and tigris) passing southward, are slowed by the zubair sill, behind which fresh water tends to pond, and to which tidal action extends.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To the west, the alluvial shelf is defined by an abrupt rise in elevation of 10-20 meteres to a miocene limestone plateau, punctuated by small step faults that are most easily visible on the surface at Hit. During wetter periods and seasons, those faults funnel intermittent streams falling from the plateau, creating sediment fans below their nick points, as is clearly visible for the wadi al-khar near HIt. The most dramatic of these fans is that of the plio-pleistocen wadi badtin fluvial cone. During drier seasons, windborne sand pours down from teh plateau, forming dune fields that are pushed southeastward ahead of prevailing winds.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The mosopotamian zone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eastern boundary is sharply demarcated by the folded uplands of the zagros piedmont. Piedmont sediments, carried downstream during pluvial periods, have deeply buried that boundary in a series of merged alluvial fans that tend to push tigris waters sowthward from the southeast-trending flow. Thus, as the shatt al-arab crests the ubair sill en route to the gulf, it passes through a sediment framed bottleneck, where much mixing, scouring and re-leveling of sediment occurs during river floods and marien incursions.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Understanding the deep structural effects of this twisted bedrock on hydrology and sediment deposition is fundamentalto understanding the processess of the twin rivers metamorphoses through time. From the eight millennium bc, at their point of emergence onto the alluvium, the tigris and euphrates appear always to have had anastomosing and significantly intermingled flows.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As the surface slope of alluvial channels levels off - either because the land itself levels or because their channels empty into a large body of water - river beds undergo threshold changes from braided, to meandering, to straight or sinuous with the latter in some cases assuming multi-channel, anastomosed patterns. Thus, in mesopotamia, braided channels are typical of the arid uplands, where the tigris and euphrates are deeply incised into the syrian and arabian plateaus, however, on dropping from thos stable shelf lands into the alluvium, the slope abruptly diminshes to less than 1 percent. There the rivers assume meandering courses through the river floodplain, within fairly stable banks. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Most sediments are dropped in flood deposits along river distributaries, over time building broad, weak levees.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Because alluvial soils comprise the best-drained agricultureal soils, direct association of htese levees with past agricultural activity is common.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Finally, as rivers abruptly slow on encountering slack water, they dump their remaining sediment loads, resulting in the multiple, bifurcating channels of a \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91bird\u8217\'92s foot\u8217\'92 delta, with newly deposited sedimetns becoming webs of marshland between the toes. }

When sea levels stabilize head-to-tail slope levels off and the rivers slow.
