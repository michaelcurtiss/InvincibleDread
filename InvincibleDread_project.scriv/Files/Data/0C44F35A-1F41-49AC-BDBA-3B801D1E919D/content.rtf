\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Some profession names are also generally thought to be pre-sumerian while the undoubtedly sumerian ones tend to be for more sophiticated urban-based professions such as that of scribe, suggesting that society was not very well developed before the sumerians.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once the previously assumed link between specific groups of people, on one hand, and material culture, on the other, is broken, as it is by most scholars tody, the question fo the arrival of the sumerians becomes less significant because the culture concerned no longer has to be equated with the arrival of a single group.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It is crucial to understand the dynamic interplay of water and sediments through rivers and marshes, levees and plains, lagoons and estuaries, and, finally, the esa. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As the earth warmed, vast rivers fed by melting ice and heavy rains carved their way through the earlier sediments that had infilled the alluvial basin between the zagros mountains of iran and the arabian plateau. They dumped those sediments into the shatt al-arab valley, creating the floor of what is now the arab-persian gulf. Throughout the early holocene, even newer sediments then infilled those channel scours. For the most part, this re-leveled the basin floor. - in some places burying the earlier surface beneath tens of meteres of alluvial sands and silt;in others, leaving older remnants exposed, like turtles\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92 backs rising above the still waters of a pond. Over time, the interplay of tectonic uplift and subduction with rising and falling sea levels, rivers and floods, and windborne sand scouring its way across that silty plain shaped and reshaped optimal zones for a variety of biological activities.}

Between najaf and kut, it further twists west to east along an oblique fault zone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The combined outflows (euphrates and tigris) passing southward, are slowed by the zubair sill, behind which fresh water tends to pond, and to which tidal action extends.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To the west, the alluvial shelf is defined by an abrupt rise in elevation of 10-20 meteres to a miocene limestone plateau, punctuated by small step faults that are most easily visible on the surface at Hit. During wetter periods and seasons, those faults funnel intermittent streams falling from the plateau, creating sediment fans below their nick points, as is clearly visible for the wadi al-khar near HIt. The most dramatic of these fans is that of the plio-pleistocen wadi badtin fluvial cone. During drier seasons, windborne sand pours down from teh plateau, forming dune fields that are pushed southeastward ahead of prevailing winds.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The mosopotamian zone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eastern boundary is sharply demarcated by the folded uplands of the zagros piedmont. Piedmont sediments, carried downstream during pluvial periods, have deeply buried that boundary in a series of merged alluvial fans that tend to push tigris waters sowthward from the southeast-trending flow. Thus, as the shatt al-arab crests the ubair sill en route to the gulf, it passes through a sediment framed bottleneck, where much mixing, scouring and re-leveling of sediment occurs during river floods and marien incursions.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Understanding the deep structural effects of this twisted bedrock on hydrology and sediment deposition is fundamentalto understanding the processess of the twin rivers metamorphoses through time. From the eight millennium bc, at their point of emergence onto the alluvium, the tigris and euphrates appear always to have had anastomosing and significantly intermingled flows.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As the surface slope of alluvial channels levels off - either because the land itself levels or because their channels empty into a large body of water - river beds undergo threshold changes from braided, to meandering, to straight or sinuous with the latter in some cases assuming multi-channel, anastomosed patterns. Thus, in mesopotamia, braided channels are typical of the arid uplands, where the tigris and euphrates are deeply incised into the syrian and arabian plateaus, however, on dropping from thos stable shelf lands into the alluvium, the slope abruptly diminshes to less than 1 percent. There the rivers assume meandering courses through the river floodplain, within fairly stable banks. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Most sediments are dropped in flood deposits along river distributaries, over time building broad, weak levees.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Because alluvial soils comprise the best-drained agricultureal soils, direct association of htese levees with past agricultural activity is common.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Finally, as rivers abruptly slow on encountering slack water, they dump their remaining sediment loads, resulting in the multiple, bifurcating channels of a \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91bird\u8217\'92s foot\u8217\'92 delta, with newly deposited sedimetns becoming webs of marshland between the toes. }

When sea levels stabilize head-to-tail slope levels off and the rivers slow. As they do, more sediment accumulates within their floodplains, along their levees, and across their existing deltas, creating ideal conditions for formation of freshwater marshlands and brackish estuaries.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 - the delta plain of the tigris and euphrates where the rivers are PRONE to branch into a network of channel. Here drainage is slow, water tables are high, many soils have a tendency to be waterlogged, and flood basins are often coverd by water or marsh.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The most obvious, but profoundly deceptive, feature of the lower mesopotamian plains is that they appear almost flat. Even minor differneces of elevation can make a significant difference to the flow of water. The gradient is only 5-10 cm per km in places, but is sufficient for the river to flow and to discharge that flow into the gulf. Channels in the lower plain have a tendency towards straightness.}

Constructed of baked bricks and bitumen, this feature appears to have taken a large volume of water and funnelled it through a narrow bick built channel which would have constrained flow to a given discharge after which the water then flowed into a widening funnel, presumably back into another channel.}
