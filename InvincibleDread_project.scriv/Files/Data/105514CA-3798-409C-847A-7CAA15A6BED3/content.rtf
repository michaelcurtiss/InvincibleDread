Once out on the surface, he got his first real look at the Sand\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Pitted Portion. He\u8217\'92d seen paintings of it, as any time a rich prick want\u8217\'92s to bring the magic of the world into his home he orders the standard eight-fold grouping of the Sand\u8217\'92s eight Portions, and when it came to the Pitted Portion, it was more or less the same painting every time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a view from high up in the western Hias looking down at landscape of barren rock dotted with large pits like the one he\u8217\'92d just been pulled out of. That wasn\u8217\'92t what Mandri saw. Laid out before him was an ordinary looking desert plain, with stands of green scrub-brush warring against stands of pink-floreted browngrass, with splotches of barren rock here and there acting as a kind of no man\u8217\'92s land. And so far as Mandri could see, there was only one other pit about a hundred yards away to the north. There might have been more of them, but he didn\u8217\'92t have time to find them because as soon as he was standing, Tob plopped a knobby sack of stuff onto his shoulder, told him he had to carry it, and told him to get a move on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moving on was a difficult thing for Mandri. The heat of the afternoon sun was sweltering, and his legs were still deeply sore. His mind was the only part of him in full working order, and that was no good because a sober and alert Mandrameen was a complainer. Here amongst the Ayramun, there were plenty of things to complain about. Two gruff men walked alongside him, and one of them smelled like a festering lizardbite. The other man was Moto. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dislike of Moto was more profound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had spent a lot of effort trying to get away from people like Moto. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d tried running away to be farmer, he had tried losing himself in burgeons, he even tried dying. Now here he was, meandering through the Pitted Portion, far enough into the wilderness to wonder if anyone had ever stepped on this spot of earth before, and there was Moto, striding alongside him, a good and well-adjusted person.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All the other Ayramun were people one could expect to find amongst a bandit troupe toughing it out in the Sand. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not a place people want to be, the sand is a land of exiles, cast offs, the maladjusted, a land for people too strange and unseemly, people whose mere existence upsets the social order\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Mandri\u8217\'92s kind of people. He liked Tob and Sob and Forty. He did not like Moto. Moto didn\u8217\'92t belong. Moto\u8217\'92s sister, Moteah, was similarly well-adjusted, but Mandri liked to look at her so he gave her a pass. In effect, there was just one person amongst the thirteen Ayramun that Mandri despised on sight. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Self-assuredness starts on the surface, with Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sharp even features, his clean-shaven and chiseled jaw, his goodly height, his broad shoulders, his bird-bright eyes looking at the world like it\u8217\'92s all a game. Even when standing still the man was dynamic. Standing still, he looked exactly like a heroic statue of Zos, for his silhouette had that same slight swerve suggesting a coiled strength. Moto might have been the model. And his garb was disgustingly fashionable, with his orange robe tucked and folded to compose a pattern of inverted triangles that accentuated the athletic V of his torso. Such considerations, set against struggle for survival out in the desert, was rude. And it was rude to look so healthy. Everyone else was being worn down by exposure to sun, wind, and hunger. Moto even had a sword with a gold plated hilt. All of this pointed to Moto being well-adjusted for a Hrkan city the size and grandeur of Jeket.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A common misconception about the well-adjusted person is that the effort put into appearance suggests that they care about how they are perceived. This is a terrible misdiagnosis. A well-adjusted person doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t care what other people think of them, that\u8217\'92s what makes them well-adjusted. If a man like Moto took other people\u8217\'92s feelings into consideration, if he played up their wants and desires, how they might be judging him, well that would lead to self-doubt, and that would lead to indecision, and sure as pure, that indecision would become a habit, leaving him perpetually anxious and uneasy. The end result: he would adjust himself to fit in. And fickleness being what it is, \u8216\'91fitting in\u8217\'92 is not a one-and-done thing, it\u8217\'92s a constant effort of adjustment and re-adjustment. Mandri wouldn\u8217\'92t begrudge a person for wanting no part of that unavailing labor, but a well-adjusted person takes it a step too far. They delight in their ignorance of others. They run roughshod over lives if they get in the way of the stomach\u8217\'92s desires. Mandri could tell Moto was that kind of person just by looking at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not wise to judge based on first impressions, as most people who seem to be well-adjusted are only pretending. Mandri suspected that Moto was the real thing because of how he laughed. As they were walking along, Mandri lagged behind on account of his abiding weakness, and Moto dropped back with him. The two were walking side by side around bush and bramble, when Mandri wondered aloud where it was they were going. Moto said that they were following the road. This didn\u8217\'92t answer Mandri so he said, \u8220\'93The road?\u8221\'94, and then Moto laughed. He said, \u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t see the road?\u8221\'94, and then he laughed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Laughs come in infinite flavors so oftentimes they can be hard to place. This laugh was one that Mandri had a special sensitivity to. It was an arrogant laugh, a laugh that said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want you to know that you\u8217\'92re beneath me\u8221\'94. It starts with a twinge of annoyed disbelief and ends on a note of derision. It\u8217\'92s a simple, lively, chuckling smirk that leaves a real bitter afterthought, and all the while the eyes aren\u8217\'92t smiling, they\u8217\'92re egging you on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But Mandri did see the road. They were walking along the gentlest raised hump of earth which snaked away into the infinite distance, a slope so slight and obscured by brush that it was easy to miss, and it was wide, at least twelve men across, so wide that it was easy to mistake for a natural drift of dirt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t know about charnel roads?\u8221\'94, Moto asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri knew about Charnel roads but he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to engage the man. He kept his eyes down and tried look like he was too miserable to talk, which he was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is the Bazul Road,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93The whole Sand is full of charnel roads just like this one.\u8221\'94 Moto kicked the ground and scattered some clumps of clay, as if doing so made the road\u8217\'92s existence more believable. \u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t see it because it\u8217\'92s old and buried. Overgrown.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Must be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is\u8230\'85 it is\u8230\'85Look, I\u8217\'92m going to ask you some questions, and I want you to answer them truthfully, and to the best of your ability.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am Mandrameen. People call me Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said answer it to the best of your ability. Was that the most thorough answer you could give?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, usually when people ask that question they\u8217\'92re asking for a name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And usually people don\u8217\'92t preface the question by telling you to answer it to the best of your ability. So I\u8217\'92ll ask again, who are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, my name is Mandrameen, and I am, or was, a farmer, and before that I was a painter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A painter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Interesting. Go on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s not much else. I guess I like burgeons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a biter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could say that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That explains some things. Is that why you\u8217\'92re out here, Mandri? Burgeons got you  biting the the beats?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, that\u8217\'92s not why.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You tell me. You\u8217\'92re the ones who brought me back from the dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mhmmm\u8230\'85right\u8230\'85I suppose I asked the wrong question. What I should have said was, what were you doing in the Junei hills in the hours before you died?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Give it some thought\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I really don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t believe you, so I\u8217\'92ll ask again, what were you doing in the hills? Before you answer, give it some thought because your answer is going to have consequences.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can give it all the thought I want, it won\u8217\'92t help. You might have found me dead in the Junei, but that\u8217\'92s not where I died. I died in Meskalem. After that, I don\u8217\'92t know what happened to me. I was dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay\u8230\'85interesting\u8230\'85Two questions then. And give me thorough answers, please. First, how did you die, and second, why would someone carry your dead body out into the wilderness?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, the answer to your first question is that I was strangled by an insane person in Meskalem. The answer to your second is, I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Answer me honestly, and there\u8217\'92s no shame in it\u8230\'85but are you stupid? Are you usually dumber than people around you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The bluntness of it made Mandri laugh. That tapered off when as soon as Mandri realized that Moto was serious. The man really thought he was dumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, I don\u8217\'92t think so.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So when I asked you to be thorough with your answer, and then you weren\u8217\'92t thorough\u8230\'85why would you do that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Brief pause. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The way I see it, you did it because you assumed that you could get away it, which is foolish, or you did it because you don\u8217\'92t understand the meaning of the word \u8216\'91thorough\u8217\'92, which implies a dumbness common to this part of the world.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What does \u8216\'91thorough\u8217\'92 mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is an attitude\u8230\'85interesting\u8230\'85look, you have been brought back to life, but whether or not you stay that way is going to depend upon }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 how }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 you answer my questions. I put emphasis on the word \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91how\u8217\'92, because how you answer them is as important as the actual content of the answer. I\u8217\'92m talking about respect. Be amenable. The Sand is big, but there\u8217\'92s no room for a lip-splitter.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t get that impression from talking with Tob and Forty.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You talking about Tob? Tob is an exception.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about Seb? And Hill?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay, what I meant is that you\u8217\'92re new. You\u8217\'92re unknown. You haven\u8217\'92t earned the right to be annoying, so you should be trying to get in my good graces or I\u8217\'92ll have you put right back where you were found.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was fine where I was.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You were dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re fine with being dead?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said what I said.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Kinda struck by it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you actually want to be dead, or are you only bitching about having to carry that pack in this heat? You know, Mandri, the way you act, I can tell you\u8217\'92re a burgeon biter. They all get thrown out into the Sand eventually. Sometimes Ayram takes them up, but it\u8217\'92s always a mistake because your minds, they\u8217\'92re too\u8230\'85short-sighted. I can already see that you\u8217\'92re a man who doesn\u8217\'92t think about the future. You don\u8217\'92t fear death, because how could you? Death is in the future and you\u8217\'92ve got no conception of that. You may think that\u8217\'92s all well and fine, because who wants to be living in fear of death, and sure, you\u8217\'92re right, but see, it\u8217\'92s not the }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 being }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 dead that you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve got to be afraid of. When you first died, you were strangled, right? That\u8217\'92s one of the easiest ways a man can go. You\u8217\'92re out in the Sand now, and I don\u8217\'92t think you understand the implication of that. This road we\u8217\'92re standing on, you see its this hump here.\u8221\'94 Moto traced the gentle contour of the road\u8217\'92s hump with an open hand. \u8220\'93It goes on further than you\u8217\'92d think is possible. The Bazul Road. One of the charnel roads. You know what a charnel road is?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do. They\u8217\'92re sacred roads.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto snickered and shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A road can\u8217\'92t be sacred any more than a rock can.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not what a Solitant would say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solitants are stupid. They\u8217\'92re stupid for almost the same reason that you are stupid; they\u8217\'92ve convinced themselves that it\u8217\'92s not worth worrying about death. They even welcome it. But ignorance won\u8217\'92t save them. It would save you. If you knew what it\u8217\'92s like to die on a charnel road, you\u8217\'92d be kissing my feet. If you don\u8217\'92t you\u8217\'92ll end up like one of those pilgrims who walks a charnel road for the chance to rot on it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought the point of walking a road was to get to where you\u8217\'92re going.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ask a pilgrim why he doesn\u8217\'92t make the Bazul Road in the comfort of a caravan and he\u8217\'92ll tell you that if Bazul did not intend for him to suffer, then Bazul wouldn\u8217\'92t have allowed himself to be martyred out in the Sand. If Bazul wanted a pilgrim to be comfortable, then Bazul would have been killed on some oated knoll near calm waters. But no, Bazul\u8217\'92s shrine is set deep into the Sand because that\u8217\'92s the journey Bazul had in mind for his people.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was an indifferent \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91ah\u8217\'92. If Moto were a normal person, an utterance like that would get him to clam up. Not the well-adjusted. Mandri might as well have been a bush rustling its branches. Moto just kept on going.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They think that walking the road is a test of faith against the power of the sun, and to skip that test is the same as having no faith at all.

Times twenty more cause a pack of drag-bellies numbers at least twenty. And that\u8217\'92s when you learn how clever a drag-belly is, because they won\u8217\'92t bite you in the neck or somewhere serious.

It\u8217\'92s because if you can keep a man from bending at the waist then he can\u8217\'92t bash his own brains in. I once made the mistake of tying a man\u8217\'92s hands and ankles and nothing else, and you know what he did when he got bit by a red-backed drag-belly?
