Once out on the surface, he got his first real look at the Sand\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Pitted Portion. He\u8217\'92d seen paintings of it, as any time a rich prick want\u8217\'92s to bring the magic of the world into his home, he orders the standard eight-fold grouping of each of the Sand\u8217\'92s Portions, and when it came to the Pitted Portion, it was more or less the same painting every time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a view from the high up in the western Hias looking down at landscape of barren rock dotted with large pits like the one he\u8217\'92d just been pulled out of. But that wasn\u8217\'92t what Mandri saw. Laid out before him was an ordinary looking desert plain, with stands of green scrub-brush warring against stands of pink-floreted browngrass, with splotches of hard rock here and there acting as a kind of no man\u8217\'92s land. And so far as Mandri could see, there was only one other pit about a hundred yards away to the north. There might have been more of them, but he didn\u8217\'92t have time to find them because as soon as he was up and standing, Tob plopped a knobby sack of stuff onto Mandri\u8217\'92s shoulder, told him he had to carry it, and told him to get a move on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moving on was a difficult thing for Mandri. The heat of the afternoon sun was sweltering, and his legs were still deeply sore. His mind was the only part of him in full working order, and that was no good, because a sober and alert Mandrameen was a complainer. Here amongst the Ayramun, there were plenty of things to complain about. The first among these was that one of the two gruff men walking alongside him smelled like a festering lizardbite. The other man was Moto. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s problem with him was more profound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had spent a lot of effort trying to get away from people like Moto. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d tried running away to be farmer, he had tried losing himself in burgeons, he even tried dying. Now here he was, meandering through the Pitted Portion far enough away from civilization to wonder if anyone had ever stepped on this spot of earth before, and there was Moto, striding alongside him, a good and well-adjusted person, the kind of person Mandri hated the most.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All the other Ayramun were the kind of people one could expect to find amongst a bandit troupe hiding out in the Sand. Each of them were maladjusted, they were cast offs, strange in their own unique and unseemly ways. Moto was the only one who didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t belong. Moto\u8217\'92s sister, Moteah, was similarly well-adjusted, but Mandri liked to look at her so he gave her a pass. In effect, there was just one person amongst the thirteen Ayramun that Mandri despised on sight. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The signs were there on the surface, with Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sharp even features, his clean-shaven and chiseled jaw, his goodly height, his broad shoulders, his bird-bright eyes looking at the world like it\u8217\'92s all a game. Even when standing still the man was dynamic. Standing still, he looked so much like a heroic statue of Zos, his silhouette a slight swerve suggesting a coiled strength, that he might have been the model. And his garb was disgustingly fashionable, his orange robe tucked and folded to compose a pattern of inverted triangles that accentuated the athletic V of his torso. This manner of dress was an affront to the struggle for survival out in the desert, even rude. Rude too, to look so healthy, because in comparison all the other Ayramun looked diseased or starving. Moto even had a sword with a gold plated hilt. Why Ayram hadn\u8217\'92t taken it for himself was a mystery. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The common misconception about the well-adjusted person is that the effort put into appearance suggests that they care about how they are perceived. Mandri had always believed that this was misdiagnosis. A well-adjusted person doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t care what other people think of them, that\u8217\'92s what makes them well-adjusted. If a man like Moto took other people\u8217\'92s feelings into consideration, if he played up their wants and desires, how they might be judging him, well, that would lead to self-doubt, and that would lead to indecision, and sure as pure, that indecision would become a habit, leaving him anxious and uneasy. The end result: he would adjust himself to fit their expectations, keyword there being \u8216\'91adjust\u8217\'92. That\u8217\'92s where natural human empathy leads, it leads to a vicious, unceasing cycle of adjustment and re-adjustment, but a well-adjusted person, by definition, no longer needs adjustment. They\u8217\'92ve hit the \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but of course that\u8217\'92s all a fantasy. All they\u8217\'92re really doing is ignoring everyone else.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But the mere sight of a clean-kept and handsome man isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t enough to reach this conclusion. After all, most people who look so proper are only pretending to be well-adjusted. For them, \u8216\'91well-adjusted\u8217\'92 is a kind of performance in which where everyone \u8216\'91adjusts\u8217\'92 themselves to a cultural norm because they care desperately about how they are perceived. Mandri suspected that Moto was the real thing because of how he laughed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As they were walking along, Mandri lagged behind on account of his abiding weakness, and Moto dropped back with him. The two were walking side by side around bush and bramble, when Mandri wondered aloud where it was they were going. Moto said that they were following the road. Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see any road, so he asked, \u8220\'93What road?\u8221\'94, and then Moto laughed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Laughs come in infinite flavors so oftentimes they can be hard to place. This laugh was one that Mandri had a special sensitivity to. It was the laugh of someone who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s achieved that enlightened being of apathy laughing at someone who hasn\u8217\'92t. It starts with a twinge of disbelief and ends on a note of derision. It\u8217\'92s a simple, lively, chuckling smirk that leaves a real bitter afterthought. What this had to do with some road, . Of course, after Moto\u8217\'92s little burst of derision, Mandri saw the road. They were walking along the gentlest raised hump of earth which snaked away into the infinite distance; a slope so slight and obscured by brush that it was easy to miss, and it was wide, at least twelve men across, so wide that it was easy to mistake for a natural drift of dirt. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t know about charnel roads?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri knew about Charnel roads, but he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to engage the man, so he kept his eyes down and tried look like he was too miserable to talk.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is the Bazul Road,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93The whole Sand is full of charnel roads just like this one.\u8221\'94 Moto kicked the ground, as if doing so made the road\u8217\'92s existence more believable. \u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t see it because it\u8217\'92s so old. It\u8217\'92s overgrown.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Must be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m going to ask you some questions, and I want you to answer them truthfully, and to the best of your ability.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93First, who are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am Mandrameen. People call me Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto shook his head and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said answer it to the best of your ability. Unless you\u8217\'92re nothing but a name, that wasn\u8217\'92t the most thorough answer you could give.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, usually when people ask that question they\u8217\'92re asking for a name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And usually people don\u8217\'92t preface the question by telling you to answer it to the best of your ability. So I\u8217\'92ll ask again, who are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, my name is Mandrameen, and I am, or was, a farmer, and before that I was a painter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A painter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Interesting. Go on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s not much else. I guess I like burgeons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a burgeon binger?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could say that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And what are you doing out here, Mandri?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I honestly don\u8217\'92t know. You\u8217\'92re the ones who brought me back from the dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I asked the wrong question. What I meant to ask was, what were you doing in the Junei hills, in the hours before you died?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Give it some thought\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I really don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that because you\u8217\'92re dumb? You look kinda dumb. You look like it hurts you to think.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can give it all the thought I want, it won\u8217\'92t help. You might have found me dead in the Junei, but that\u8217\'92s not where I died. I died in Meskalem. After that, I don\u8217\'92t know what happened to me. I was dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Two questions then. And give me thorough answers, please. First, how did you die, and second, why would someone carry your dead body out into the wilderness?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, the answer to your first question is that I was strangled by an insane person. The answer to your second is, I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Answer me honestly, and there\u8217\'92s no shame in it\u8230\'85but are you stupid? Are you usually dumber than people around you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The bluntness of it made Mandri laugh. That tapered off when as soon as Mandri realized that Moto was serious. The man really thought he was dumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, I don\u8217\'92t think so.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So when I asked you to be thorough with your answer, and then you weren\u8217\'92t thorough\u8230\'85why would you do that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Brief pause. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The way I see it, you did it because you assumed that you could get away it, which is foolish, or you did it because you don\u8217\'92t understand the meaning of the word \u8216\'91thorough\u8217\'92, which is dumb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I guess you\u8217\'92ve got me figured out. I don\u8217\'92t know what \u8216\'91thorough\u8217\'92 means.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Disgusted look. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Was that sarcasm?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Most obviously sarcastic tone imaginable \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sarcasm? What does that word mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto put his hand on Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest and. Profound disappointment. \u8220\'93Okay, that is an attitude\u8230\'85interesting\u8230\'85look\u8230\'85you have been brought back to life, but whether or not you stay that way is going to depend upon }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 how }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 you answer my questions. I put emphasis on the word \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91how\u8217\'92, because how you answer them is as important as the actual content of the answer. I\u8217\'92m talking about respect. Be amenable. The Sand is big, but even so, there\u8217\'92s no room for a lipsplitter.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t get that impression from talking with Tob and Forty.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tob is an exception. So is Forty.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about Seb? And Hill?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay, what I mean is that you\u8217\'92re new. You\u8217\'92re unknown. You haven\u8217\'92t given anything to anyone. You should be trying to make a good impression, or else we\u8217\'92ll put you right back where we found you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was fine where I was.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But you were dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh-huh.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You were fine with being dead?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said what I said.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 why}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  did you say it? What does that mean? Do you actually want to be dead, or are you only bitching about having to carry that pack in this heat.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not sure, you tell me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know, Mandri, the way you act, I can tell you\u8217\'92re a burgeon binger. They all get thrown out into the Sand eventually. Sometimes Ayram takes them up, but it\u8217\'92s always a mistake. See, burgeons addle the mind. They makes a man short-sighted\u8230\'85in a time sense I mean; he can\u8217\'92t think about the future. Take too many burgeons and the future might as well not exist. But you know what exists in the future? Death. Death is in the future. But you beaters aren\u8217\'92t afraid of death, because how could you be. You may well think that\u8217\'92s all well and fine, because who wants to be living in fear of death, and sure, you\u8217\'92re right, but see, it\u8217\'92s not the }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 being dead}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  that you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve got to be afraid of. When you first died, you said you were strangled, right? That\u8217\'92s one of the easiest ways a man can go. But you\u8217\'92re out in the Sand now, and I don\u8217\'92t think you appreciate the implication of that. This road we\u8217\'92re standing on, you see its this hump here.\u8221\'94 Moto traced the gentle contour of the road\u8217\'92s hump with an open hand. \u8220\'93It goes on further than you\u8217\'92d think is possible. The Bazul Road. One of the charnel roads. You know what a charnel road is?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do. They\u8217\'92re sacred roads.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A road can\u8217\'92t be sacred any more than a rock can.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not what a pilgrim would say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pilgrims are stupid. They\u8217\'92re stupid for almost the same reason that you are stupid; they\u8217\'92re flippant about dying. They even welcome death, but I\u8217\'92ve spoken to a good many, and I know that that good cheer is a symptom of ignorance, because they haven\u8217\'92t considered what it\u8217\'92s like to die on a charnel road. Their minds are so warped that they see dying out here as something of an achievement. Some of them walk these roads just to get the chance to die on them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought the point of walking a road was to get to where you\u8217\'92re going.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ask a pilgrim why he doesn\u8217\'92t make the Bazul Road in a carriage and he\u8217\'92ll tell you that if Bazul did not intend for him to suffer, then Bazul wouldn\u8217\'92t have allowed himself to be martyred out in the Sand. If Bazul wanted a pilgrim to lead a life of comfort, then he\u8217\'92d have been killed on some oated knoll near calm waters. But oh, no, Bazul\u8217\'92s shrine is set deep into the Sand because Bazul deemed it fit to be killed there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was an indifferent \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91ah\u8217\'92. If Moto were a normal person, an utterance like that would get him to clam up. Not the well-adjusted. Mandri might as well have been a bush rustling its branches. Moto just kept on going.}

He could have told Mandri that he \u8216\'91needed improvement\u8217\'92, and likely the two would have gone on to trade insults all the way to Minting Rock. The slap, all that did was sting.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Funny how a word could do that, revert a budding man into a child - not even a child, in that moment Mandri was a sense organ, a bundle of light and sound and confusion incapable of comprehending what it was and what was happening to it.  And it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t just the word that did all this, it was the lifetime of indignities that had glommed onto it, a veritable wrecking ball, one his father had been forging for years, ever since the first time he\u8217\'92d caught Mandri\u8217\'92s wrist and told him to stop acting like a fag.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All this, it was a hindrance to living. So, for the second time in as many weeks, Mandri decided to simply stop. He unshouldered his pack, let it hit the ground with a thud, and marched off. }

And when you look at those bones you\u8217\'92ll see how they\u8217\'92re scattered about and he\u8217\'92s missing a few limbs. That\u8217\'92s because drag-bellys got to him. Takes a while for a pack of drag-bellys to eat a man full, and when you\u8217\'92re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you\u8217\'92ll still be alive when they do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I get it.\u8221\'94}

Whatever pain you\u8217\'92re feeling now, it\u8217\'92ll be that times a hundred. Times a thousand for the venom. Times twenty more cause a pack of drag-bellies numbers at least twenty. And that\u8217\'92s when you learn how smart a drag-belly can be, because they won\u8217\'92t bite you in the neck or somewhere serious. They know how to keep you alive as long as possible. Keeps the meat fresh. \u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know what you\u8217\'92re thinking. You\u8217\'92re thinking you can just kill yourself before any of that happens. But you\u8217\'92re not thinking, thinking. You need to remember what I said earlier about leaving a boy half-buried in a mudpan. Ask yourself why this man named Moto would do a thing like that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto stood up straight and waited for Mandri to give an answer. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a full-wait, it was a half-wait, a token gesture to suggest this was a conversation. As soon as Mandri opened his mouth, Moto charged on ahead.}

It\u8217\'92s because if you can keep a man from bending at the waist then he can\u8217\'92t bash his own brains in. Make the mistake of tying a man\u8217\'92s hands and legs and nothing else, and you know what he\u8217\'92ll do when he gets bit by a red-backed drag-belly? He\u8217\'92ll get on his knees like a groveling postulant, then he\u8217\'92ll bend back, face to the heavens like he\u8217\'92s rapt in prayer - that\u8217\'92s what I thought he was doing - and then he\u8217\'92ll swing forward and smash his head against a rock.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob called out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey Moto!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto twisted around to see Sob and Chopper walking there where he and Mandri had been a moment ago. Sob looked winded. Chopper looked like a pack animal, the bulk of leather and cloth on his back incongruous atop his skinny legs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya\u8217\'92ll takin a shit, or what?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bring it over!\u8221\'94 Moto shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob upset with Chopper for showing the rope.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob said something to Chopper, and the two came running over. When they arrived and saw Mandri lying down in a ditch, Sob laughed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What, the boy needs help to pop a squat?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob pulled the rope away from Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s outstretched hand. He coddled it close to his chest like it was a work of holy scripture.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He asked again, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What you need it for?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shut up. Give me the rope.\u8221\'94}
