Once out on the surface, he got his first real look at the Sand\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Pitted Portion. He\u8217\'92d seen paintings of it, as any time a person wants to bring the magic of the world into their home they orders the standard eight piece polyptych of the Sand\u8217\'92s eight Portions, and when it came to the Pitted Portion, the painting was more or less the same every time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a view from high up in the western Hias looking down at landscape of barren rock dotted with large pits like the one he\u8217\'92d just been pulled out of. But that wasn\u8217\'92t what Mandri saw. Laid out before him was an ordinary looking desert plain, with stands of green scrub-brush warring against stands of pink-floreted browngrass, with splotches of barren rock here and there acting as a no man\u8217\'92s land. And so far as Mandri could see, there was only one other pit about a hundred yards away to the north. There might have been more of them, but he didn\u8217\'92t have time to find them because Tob plopped a knobby sack of stuff onto his shoulder, told him he had to carry it, and told him to get a move on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moving on was a difficult thing for Mandri. The heat of the afternoon sun was sweltering, and his legs were still deeply sore. His mind was the only part of him in full working order, and that was no good because a sober and alert Mandrameen was a complainer. Here, amongst the Ayramun, there were plenty of things to complain about. Two gruff men walked alongside him, and one of them smelled like a festering lizardbite. The other man was Moto. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dislike of Moto was more profound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had spent a lot of effort trying to get away from people like Moto. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d tried running away to be farmer, he had tried losing himself in burgeons, he even tried dying. Yet here he was, meandering through the Pitted Portion, far enough out into the wilderness to wonder if anyone had ever stepped foot on this spot of earth before, and there was Moto, striding alongside him, a good and well-adjusted person. All the other Ayramun were people one could expect to find amongst a bandit troupe toughing it out in the Sand. This was a land of exiles, cast offs, a land to catch the spall of conquered nations. It was a land for people too strange and unseemly, whose mere existence upset the social order. It was a place for people like Mandri. Different as he was from Tob, Seb, and Forty, he had an easy respect for them. He had no such respect for Moto. Moto was too well put together. The man had a bearing that demanded respect. He belonged in a Hrkan city. Moto\u8217\'92s sister, Moteah, was similarly well-adjusted, but Mandri liked to look at her hips sway so he gave her a pass. In effect, there was just one person amongst the thirteen Ayramun that Mandrameen despised on sight, and while it\u8217\'92s not wise to judge a person based on sight alone, no one ever accused Mandri of being wise. In his own estimation, he was never wrong about a person, and if he was, it was because the information available at the time was misleading.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The smugness he saw in Moto started on the surface, with Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sharp even features, his clean-shaven and chiseled jaw, his goodly height, his broad shoulders, his bird-bright eyes looking at the world like it was all a game, like people are toys. When standing still the man was dynamic. Standing still, he looked exactly like a heroic statue of Zos, a swerve of coiled strength. And his color was an exact match in shade to the color of Zos\u8217\'92s painted skin\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 two parts burnt umber, one part Wazian blue. His garb was disgustingly fashionable, with his orange robe tucked and folded to compose a pattern of inverted triangles that accentuated the athletic V of his torso. Such considerations, set against struggle for survival out in the desert, were rude. And it was rude to look so healthy. Everyone else was worn down from the years of exposure to the sun, wind, and hunger. Moto even had a sword with a gold plated hilt. It was clear that this man was well-adjusted, and in Mandri\u8217\'92s eyes, being well-adjusted was as clear a sign of derangement you can get.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A common misconception about the well-adjusted person is that the effort put into appearance suggests they care about how they are perceived. This is a misdiagnosis. A well-adjusted person doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t care what other people think of them, that\u8217\'92s what makes them well-adjusted. If a man like Moto took other people\u8217\'92s feelings into consideration, if he played up their wants and desires, how they might be judging him, well that would lead to self-doubt, and that would lead to indecision, and sure as pure, that indecision would become a habit, leaving him perpetually anxious and uneasy. The end result: he would feel bad about looking so well off amidst such squalor. He would adjust himself to fit in. He\u8217\'92d try to look miserable even if he wasn\u8217\'92t. Fickleness being what it is, \u8216\'91fitting in\u8217\'92 with other people is not a one-and-done thing, it\u8217\'92s a constant effort of adjustment and re-adjustment, so if a person has any kind of empathy at all, well that precludes that possibility of being well-adjusted. It\u8217\'92s either that unending labor of fitting in, or sit on the side, or pretend you\u8217\'92re above it all and run roughshod over people\u8217\'92s lives. That takes some real, purposeful ignorance to be able to do, and Mandri could tell that Moto was filled with that ignorance just by looking at him, though it wasn\u8217\'92t just looks, Moto\u8217\'92s behavior reinforced it. As they walked, Moto would go out of his way to step on fresh sprouts of grass. His leather sole would twist and squish the little shootlings into the ground as they tried to carve out a meager existence in between cracks of rock. This little cruelty was still a cruelty.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A question that plagued Mandri for most of his short adult life was why, if people generally agreed that world was horrible, why those who adjusted to it the best are held in highest esteem. These assholes were so highly regarded that people wanted to be like them, people would fake being well-adjusted. Mandri suspected the real ones were small in number, comparatively speaking, and despite that, they were everywhere. Moto was one of them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As they were walking along, Mandri lagged behind on account of his abiding weakness, and Moto dropped back with him. The two were walking side by side around bush and bramble when Mandri wondered aloud where it was they were going. Moto said that they were following the road. This didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t answer Mandri\u8217\'92s question, so he asked, \u8220\'93The road?\u8221\'94\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a two word request for clarification. Then Moto laughed. He said, \u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t see the road?\u8221\'94, and then he laughed again. It was a short, arrogant laugh. It started with a twinge of annoyed disbelief and ended with a note of derision. It was a simple, lively, chuckling smirk, and it left a bitter afterthought, made worse by the fact that Moto\u8217\'92s eyes weren\u8217\'92t smiling, they were egging Mandri on to say another silly thing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But Mandri did see the road. They were walking along the gentlest raised hump of earth which snaked away into the infinite distance, a slope so slight and obscured by brush that, sure, it was easy to miss, or easy to mistake for a natural drift of dirt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t know about charnel roads?\u8221\'94, Moto asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri knew about Charnel roads but he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to engage the man. He kept his eyes down and tried look like he was too miserable to talk, which was easy to do because it was true.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is the Bazul Road,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93The whole Sand is full of charnel roads just like this one.\u8221\'94 Moto kicked the ground and scattered some loose stones, as if doing so made the road\u8217\'92s existence more believable. \u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t see it because it\u8217\'92s old and buried. Overgrown.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Must be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is\u8230\'85 it is\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But of course the man was shadowing him for a reason.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look,\u8221\'94 said Moto, \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m going to ask you some questions, and I want you to answer them truthfully and to the best of your ability.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was wondering when this moment would come. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright,\u8221\'94 and was hopeful about it, because he wanted to get some information in return.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am Mandrameen. People call me Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said answer the question to the best of your ability. Was that the best answer you could give?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri reflexively smiled to soothe any budding tension and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, usually when people ask that question they\u8217\'92re asking for a name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sneered and nipped back, saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Usually people don\u8217\'92t preface the question by telling you to answer it to the best of your ability. So I\u8217\'92ll ask again, who are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, my name is Mandrameen, and I am, or was, a farmer, and before that I was a painter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A painter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Interesting,\u8221\'94 said Moto as he livened up. \u8220\'93Go on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s not much else. I guess I like burgeons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I could tell.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could tell? Really? How?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m asking the questions, Mandri\u8230\'85Now, is that why we found you dead in the Junei hills? Were you looking for burgeons, and what, you were high and forgot to bring water?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, that\u8217\'92s not even close.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then what were you doing out there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I honestly don\u8217\'92t know. The last thing I remember, I was in Meskalem.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mhmmm\u8230\'85Meskalem?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, I don\u8217\'92t know how I ended up out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Give it some thought\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I really don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said, give it some thought.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can give it all the thought I want, it won\u8217\'92t help. You might have found me dead in the Junei, but that\u8217\'92s not where I died. I died in Meskalem. After that, I don\u8217\'92t know what happened to me. I was dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Interesting\u8230\'85Two questions, then. And give me thorough answers. First, how did you die, and second, why would someone carry your dead body all the way over the Hias?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, the answer to your first question is that I was strangled by an insane person. The answer to your second question is, I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto stopped walking, and sole- stamp of his foot made it clear that Mandri was supposed to stop walking too, so he did. He faced Moto, and because Moto had his hands on his hips and looked like he was about to harangue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Answer me honestly,\u8221\'94 said Moto, \u8220\'93And there\u8217\'92s no shame in it\u8230\'85but are you stupid? Are you usually dumber than people around you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri laughed at the bluntness, but his laugh tapered off when he realized that Moto was serious. The man really thought he was dumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not dumb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When I asked you to be thorough with your answer, and then you weren\u8217\'92t thorough\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look, I\u8217\'92m telling you what I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto looked displeased with this answer. Look to the sky, the look of a man preparing for an unavailing labor. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The way I see it, you\u8217\'92re being kiddy with me because you think you can get away it, which means you\u8217\'92re stupid, or you doing it because you don\u8217\'92t understand the meaning of the word \u8216\'91thorough\u8217\'92, because you\u8217\'92re stupid. Which is it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not either of those things. I\u8217\'92m telling you the truth.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Again, I said to be }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 thorough}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . This is the point of contention here, thoroughness. I want the truth, yes, but I want it in its fullness. You understand? I don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to be asking questions all day long. You understand?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, I do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto, doubting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93 Something you need to understand is that, while you\u8217\'92ve been brought back to life, whether or not you stay that way is going to depend upon }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 how }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 you answer my questions. Notice that I put emphasis on the word \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91how\u8217\'92. I\u8217\'92m talking about respect. Be amenable. Be thorough. The Sand is big, but there\u8217\'92s no room for a lip-splitter.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not trying to be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 No matter what Mandri said, it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t matter, Moto had already made up his mind about. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re new. You\u8217\'92re unknown. You haven\u8217\'92t earned the right to mess around, so you should be trying to get in my good graces or I\u8217\'92ll have you put right back where you were found.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was fine where I was.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto laughed and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You were dead. You\u8217\'92re fine with being dead?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said what I said.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Kinda struck by it. He started to walk again, saying, }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That kind of talk, Mandri, is how I can tell you\u8217\'92re a burgeon biter. They all get thrown out into the Sand eventually. Sometimes Ayram takes them up, but it\u8217\'92s always a mistake because your minds, they\u8217\'92re too\u8230\'85short-sighted. You can\u8217\'92t think about the future. You know what I mean.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes\u8221\'94 to be polite.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See, I believe you when you say you happy being dead. You don\u8217\'92t fear death, because how could you? Death is in the future and you\u8217\'92ve got no conception of that. You may think that\u8217\'92s all well and fine, because who wants to be living in fear of death, and you\u8217\'92re right, but see, it\u8217\'92s not the }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 being }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 dead that you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve got to be afraid of.\u8221\'94 The more Moto spoke, the more he was getting wrapped up in his own words, and he was using his hands to do it. The man spoke with hadns, and his shoulders to, they\u8217\'92d have been a bouncing and thrusting and jerking a whole lot more if it weren\u8217\'92t for the heavy backpack he was bearing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You said you were strangled, right? That\u8217\'92s one of the easiest ways a man can go. But you\u8217\'92re out in the Sand now, and I don\u8217\'92t think you appreciate the implication of that. This road we\u8217\'92re standing on, you see its this hump here.\u8221\'94 Moto traced the gentle contour of the road\u8217\'92s hump with an open hand. \u8220\'93It goes on further than you\u8217\'92d think is possible. The Bazul Road. One of the charnel roads. You know what a charnel road is?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re sacred roads.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto snickered and spat. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A road can\u8217\'92t be sacred any more than a rock can.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not what a Solitant would say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solitants are stupid. If they knew what it was like to die on a charnel road, they wouldn\u8217\'92t walk them. If }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  knew, you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be kissing my feet. Believe me, Mandri, you don\u8217\'92t want to end up like one of those pilgrims. They walk charnel road just for the chance to rot on them, and let me tell you, that\u8217\'92s not all that happens to them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought the point of walking a road was to get to where you\u8217\'92re going.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pilgrims don\u8217\'92t really care about the destination. Ask a pilgrim why he doesn\u8217\'92t make the Bazul Road in the comfort of a caravan and he\u8217\'92ll tell you that if Bazul did not intend for him to suffer, then Bazul wouldn\u8217\'92t have allowed himself to be martyred out in the Sand, he would have been killed on some oated knoll near calm waters. They\u8217\'92ll say that Bazul\u8217\'92s shrine is set deep into the Sand because that\u8217\'92s the journey Bazul had in mind for his people. In way, the road itself is the shrine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.It was an indifferent \u8216\'91ah\u8217\'92, and if Moto were a normal person, sensitive to conversational cues, an utterance like that would have him clam up. Not so. Moto kept on going.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They think that walking the road is a test of faith against the power of the sun, and to skip that test is the same as having no faith at all. True Solitant pilgrims don\u8217\'92t trivialize the road by riding in a wagon or walking it at night. They walk the road in the heat of the day, and they die doing it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tragic.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Show some respect.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sorry.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t say sorry when you don\u8217\'92t mean it. If you don\u8217\'92t take your own words as serious, then I know you\u8217\'92re not taking mine serious. But you need to be serious, Mandri. I\u8217\'92m half a mind to leave you here and let the sun finish you off. It\u8217\'92s not a good death\u8230\'85You ever seen a waterless man with a black tongue the size of a hermit slug? I don\u8217\'92t think you have. Imagine rubbing your eyes with no moisture in them. Imagine an ache that splits you from your head down to your toes, makes it feel like your stomach is peeling apart, like the marrow in your bones is boiling. The worst part is when your mouth dries out\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it turns black and the tongue swells up to bursting.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sounds horrible.\u8221\'94\line \tab \u8220\'93Haven\u8217\'92t got to the worst of it. There\u8217\'92s an old pile of pilgrim\u8217\'92s bones not far from here that I could show you. And when you see them you\u8217\'92ll see how they\u8217\'92re scattered about and he\u8217\'92s missing a few limbs. That\u8217\'92s because drag-bellys got to him. Takes a while for a pack of drag-bellys to eat a man full, and when you\u8217\'92re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you\u8217\'92ll still be alive when they do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I get it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do not think that you do,\u8221\'94 Moto said. It took everything in Mandri not to laugh at Moto\u8217\'92s patronizing glare.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Drag bellies don\u8217\'92t wait for you to die, they just start chewing. A drag-belly\u8217\'92s venom stings worse than fire. It pulps the flesh. It\u8217\'92ll make your thighs look like brains. And they got a hundred little teeth like needles.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He then punched Mandri in the shoulder, dead-armed him. Mandri winced pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92d you do that for!?\u8221\'94, he cried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whatever pain you\u8217\'92re feeling now, it\u8217\'92ll be that times a hundred. And that\u8217\'92s when you learn how clever a drag-belly is, because they won\u8217\'92t bite you in the neck or somewhere serious. They know how to keep you alive as long as possible to keep the meat fresh, like they been trained by demons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, pleading. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m trying to tell you what I know, and what I know isn\u8217\'92t much. That\u8217\'92s the truth of it. I have no idea how I got to be out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re not getting out of this. You might be thinking you can just kill yourself before anything too painful happens, but you\u8217\'92re not }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 thinking}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , thinking. I once left a boy like you half-buried in a mudpan near Fleet. Ask yourself why I would do a thing like that.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto paused his rambling, as if to give Mandri a chance to answer, but the man couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t help himself\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 as soon as Mandri opened his mouth, Moto charged on ahead, the tenor of his voice growing firmer with every step, as if all of this was well rehearsed and he was just now getting into his favorite part.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You want a hint? I\u8217\'92ll just tell you. It\u8217\'92s because if you can keep a man from bending at the waist then he can\u8217\'92t bash his own brains in. I once made the mistake of tying a man\u8217\'92s hands and ankles and nothing else, and you know what he did when he got bit by a red-backed drag-belly? He got on his knees like a priest\u8230\'85then he bent back, face to the heavens like he\u8217\'92s rapt in prayer\u8230\'85that\u8217\'92s what I thought he was doing\u8230\'85maybe he was\u8230\'85and then\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 WHAM\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he swung forward and smashed his head against a rock, cracked his skull like a spider web.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As Moto said all this, he imitated the action, headbutting the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know how many times I can say this,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, \u8220\'93But I honestly do not know how I got to be out there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, I don\u8217\'92t care about that anymore. Or I should say, we\u8217\'92ll put that off to the side for now. What\u8217\'92s more important, is that you said you were fine with dying, so now my primary concern is curing you of that illusion. See, I know what you are, Mandri, and I know what you need.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do I need?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not burgeons, that\u8217\'92s for damn sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto then called out to the two Ayramun walking ahead of them. The two men were only a little ways off, but still, Moto was shouting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey, Tob!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both men stopped and turned around.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whaddya want!?\u8221\'94 Tob answered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The other man was Chopper. Chopper\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s backpack was so big that he looked like a pack animal, his sillhouette a bloated blob of burlap plopped atop two stick-skinny legs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto shouted back, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You got any rope?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you want rope\u8221\'94, said Tob, \u8220\'93you come an get it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto pushed along a little faster, and they met up with Tob and Chopper. Tob had unslung his own heavy pack, was straddling it, digging around for a length of coiled rope.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What you need it for?\u8221\'94 Tob asked.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Last time I lent you rope, you cut it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t cut it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what you said last time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto rubbed his brow and . He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m gonna tie the boy up, and toss him in a lizard pit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob pulled out a thick coil of flat-rope, but was hesitant to hand it over.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He needs to learn a lesson.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When was that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When you shot at little Kinzy in that burgee tree.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto held out his hand like a tax-collector, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93\u8220\'93Give me the rope.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob recoiled in disgust as he coddled the against his chest like it was an icon of Solraheen. Tob asked again, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What you need it for?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I already told you\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 I\u8217\'92m going to tie the boy up and toss him to some lizards.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob looked to Mandri with concern, a bushy brow knit so tight . While it was a look of deep and steadfast concern, it just wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t meant for Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I spent too much time on this rope to let some lizard chew it up!\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob began to stuff the rope back into his pack, but was stopped when Moto tapped his foot and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tob, if you don\u8217\'92t give it to me, I\u8217\'92m going to take it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob stammered those words in disbelief. He raised the rope in his clenched fist, knuckles white, and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You already owe me forty feet!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 your}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  rope,\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s Ayram\u8217\'92s.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mouth went wide at the, and Mandri saw the memory of some injustice flash in his features. Tob then threw the rope at Moto\u8217\'92s feet, gathered up his pack, and said, \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m gonna tell Ayram about this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Be sure that you do.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 After Tob stormed off, Moto turned to Chopper, who was still standing there like a patient son, and asked him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chopper was looking at the rope with thirsty eyes.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93But not yet. You want to come?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chopper nodded, and the three of them\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Mandri, Moto, and Chopper\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 headed off the hump of the road and into the unsullied expanse of the Pitted Portion. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri mulled his options. Moto seemed serious about feeding him to lizards, and being a stubborn man, there was no arguing with him. There was no where to run, even if he could run, which Mandri very much doubted. He was completely at Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mercy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have to wonder how far they\u8217\'92d be walking because some few hundred yards away there was an outcrop of round black rock which looked unmistakably like a gore beetle. One large, round, smooth stone was the beetle\u8217\'92s body, and next to it was a much smaller boulder that looked like an upturned thorn; the beetle\u8217\'92s horned head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Arrayed around the base of Beetle Rock was not one lizard pit, but several. They were more like shallow pans than pits\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 drag-bellies aren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t very industrious creatures\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and at the base each pan was a single, egg-shaped hole. There were no lizards in sight. Mandri supposed they were hiding in their dens because when Moto led Mandri to one of larger pits, he did so with an excited energy, kind of creeping up to it like the waist-deep crater might suddenly erupt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once at the pit\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s edge, both Moto and Chopper unsettled their great heavy packs, and Mandri unshouldered his meager one, and he let it drop without much care for what was in it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s time,\u8221\'94 said Moto as he unwound an arm\u8217\'92s length of rope.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you\u8217\'92re trying to scare me into answering your questions it\u8217\'92s not going to work. I already told you everything I know.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto began to wrap a figure eight of rope around Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wrists. He said, \u8220\'93Boy your age gets upset and jumps into burgeons, it\u8217\'92s always over a girl.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Believe what you want.\u8221\'94}

What you are has somehow escaped the notice of every poet and philosopher whose ever lived. But I know what you are because I used to be like you. That\u8217\'92s why you should count yourself lucky to have stumbled into me. I\u8217\'92m one person in all the world who knows how to cure you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto motioned to Chopper. Chopper was too busy salivating at the sight of the too-long length of rope left after Moto had tight his knot.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chopper marched over and forced Mandri onto his ass. Mandri struggled a little, confused as to what, precisely, Chopper\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s herks and jerks were trying to achieve}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you make this difficult, I\u8217\'92m going to have Chopper take your balls. You got it? Nod if you got it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto then set about tying Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ankles together. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Down in the lizard pit, a wide, dusty grey, shovel-like lizard snout hovered out of the dark den entrance. It was a drag-belly. It licked the air with a yellow, clover-leaf tongue, and before it could get in a second scenting, another drag-belly snout appeared. The two lizards jostled for position, the newcomer got feisty, started a hissing argument, then lurched and bit the first lizard in the neck. A seething brawl erupted, and two lizards disappeared into the den, scratching and clawing for the right to maul whatever was lurking outside. The brawl ended in a wild screeching hiss of pain, and the winner stuck its wide, froggish head out into the air. Its swiveling eye worked over the three men, then settled on Mandri as though it knew he were the weakest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto tied the knot around Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ankle\u8217\'92s tight, so tight that his ankle bones were bruising against each other. Moto then stood up straight and observed his handiwork with approval. Knows how he wants to proceed, but hesitates, because. He said, \u8220\'93I need to prime you for what you\u8217\'92re about to experience\u8230\'85so\u8230\'85\u8221\'94, Moto an uncertain pause. He was clearly more excited about all this than Mandri was. He said, \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m going to ask you a question, and I want you to think very carefully about it\u8230\'85I want you to treat this question as if it were a newborn baby, like you\u8217\'92re holding a newborn for the first time, you understand?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright. Here it is. Why did Solraheen create human beings?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why did Solraheen create us?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did I say to blurt out the first thing that came to mind? No! I said think about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The drag-belly was now half-way out of it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s den. It\u8217\'92s squat forearms were pushing it up as high as it could, so that it\u8217\'92s head could stretch up high towards Mandri and savor his odor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It might help if you told me what this has to do with feeding me to lizards.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not feeding you to lizards,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93What I\u8217\'92m doing is giving you a problem to solve\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and that\u8217\'92s a hint to the answer to my question.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look, I don\u8217\'92t give a damn about whatever stupid point you\u8217\'92re trying to make. I\u8217\'92d rather you throw me in.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t think that. I can tell. Mandri, I can see the way you look at that lizard. You fear it. That drag-belly is a problem, isn\u8217\'92t it? It\u8217\'92s here in the present and you can\u8217\'92t ignore it. You\u8217\'92re thinking about what you\u8217\'92re going to do when I throw you in that pit\u8230\'85That\u8217\'92s what we do better than any other creature.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What, thinking?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, well, yes, we do have the advantage of thought, but thought is not an end unto itself. Thought is a tool. Right now, you are using thought to try and do\u8230\'85what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri at the absurdity of whatever it was Moto was trying to say.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just tell me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sighed. It was the same sigh that had helped Mandri time and time again when giving painting lessons to old Vigram. It was the sigh of a teacher\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s displeasure at being refused by a student\u8217\'92s stupidity. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The answer is problem solving. That\u8217\'92s what we were designed to do\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 we were designed to solve problems. Birds were made to fly, fish were made to swim, and you and I were made to solve problems. Practical problems. We build shelters to solve the weather, we build farms to solve hunger, and we chop wood to solve heat. We kill eachother to solve\u8230\'85well, that can solve a variety of problems. That\u8217\'92s what we do. Now, you take a fish out of water, and what happens? It dies. You clip a bird\u8217\'92s wings and what happens? It becomes sad and helpless. If a man feels like there are no problems for him to solve, he feels useless, because he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  useless. That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what\u8217\'92s wrong with you, Mandri. And to make it all worse you\u8217\'92ve filled your belly with burgeons. When you do that, you lose the ability to identify problems. So if you can\u8217\'92t even see them, then obviously, you\u8217\'92ve got no problems to solve! You\u8217\'92re a man without purpose, you understand? Solraheen created us to solve problems. Schisol created burgeons to ruin that ability. You understand?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No you don\u8217\'92t. If you did, we wouldn\u8217\'92t be out here doing this. The unfortunate fact is, there\u8217\'92s only one way for you to get it, and me telling you how it is isn\u8217\'92t enough. So what I\u8217\'92m going to do now is, I\u8217\'92m pick you up and put into a problem. I\u8217\'92m going to toss you in this pit with that drag-belly. Your instincts will kick in, and you\u8217\'92re going to try to get out of the situation, you\u8217\'92re going to try to solve the problem. Because that\u8217\'92s what we do.\u8221\'94}

If you throw a bird off a cliff, what\u8217\'92s it going to do? It\u8217\'92s going to fly. You\u8217\'92re going to be flying before you know it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you tie up a bird\u8217\'92s wings, it\u8217\'92s not going to be able to fly when you throw it off a cliff.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure, a bird needs its wings to fly, but you don\u8217\'92t need your arms and legs to solve problems. What tying you up does, is it removes the obvious solutions. You\u8217\'92re going to have to dig a little deeper, exercise that god-given talent known as creativity.

And just his luck, the drag-belly emerged once again from it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s den, head weaving slightly side to side, warily tasting the air.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri fought back a flinch as the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tongue touched his toe.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was unfazed by Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pronouncement. He steeled himself for whatever was going to emerge from that drag-belly den. Even so, he was wholly unprepared for what did come. It was not a lizard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Two blood red arms, human-like, with hands scaled and taloned like a bird of prey, burst out of the darkness and grabbed Mandri around his tied-up ankles.
