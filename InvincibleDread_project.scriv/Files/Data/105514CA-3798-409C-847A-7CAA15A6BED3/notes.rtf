\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i0  unlike the highways which keep to the river banks or hop between oases, these roads cut through the vast expanses of the Sand, and that means exposure to the sun, the wind, and the heat - it is certain death if a pilgrim goes unprepared. The longer the road the deadlier it all is, though that\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92s only a rule of thumb because the worst Charnel Road, the Bazul Road, is one of the shortest. It sits just north of the Uncharted Portion and it runs up and over the crest of a low-lying range of hills. An eon of blasting sand had reduced those once proud mountains to a dump of gravel, and it does much the same to pilgrims who dare to make the scramble.}
\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i0 It only takes a full day to make the Bazul Road if you start at the nearest Hrkan outpost at Shahiz, but the Bazul road is a shadeless world of chalky gravel, white as bone, so the sunlight doesn\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92t disappear into the ground, it gets thrown right back up into the face. A pilgrim can\u8217\'92t even hide in her own shadow. She gets baked from below as much as from above.}
