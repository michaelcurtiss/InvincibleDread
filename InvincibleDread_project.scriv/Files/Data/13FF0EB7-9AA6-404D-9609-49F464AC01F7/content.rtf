\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s nothing complicated about terror\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 or any emotion for that matter. Love, hate, terror, whatever, Mandri was old enough to see through their tired routine: first they startled him into stupidity, and then they spurred him into action, or reigned him in, according to the flavor of the moment. There was no fighting it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A roaring beam of Mazydfire lit up the night, and next thing Mandri knew, he was running through Shulgi\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bowels, bumping his nose and toes on stone shelves and footings because he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed to hold a torch, and he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed, according to Moto, because that there wasn\u8217\'92t any time to light one up, even though it only took five god-damned seconds. As it goes with terror, love, hate, and whatever; reason is not allowed to have a say.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri hated it. Hating hate might seem paradoxical, but that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s just a trick of language. This was a reasonable hate. It starts with distrust. He distrusted terror and hate and all of those other emotions for the simple reason that it\u8217\'92s possible to feel two of them at once. If you can both love and hate a person, then that proves that there is a truer, deeper, reality of which love and hate are only crude approximations\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in Mandri\u8217\'92s terms, there\u8217\'92s a color portrait to be painted here, but all we have are pigments black and white.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And to be clear, this wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a trick of language. It\u8217\'92s not the case that the condition of \u8216\'91loving-and-hating\u8217\'92 is, in itself, a unique emotional state for which some genius has yet to come along and invent the right word to label it. What is really happening is that one moment there is a caring love, and in the next there is a spiteful hate, and the mind vacillates between the two, and seeing them pass by in quick succession blurs them together, but if Mandri stopped and noticed he could distinguish them, and as soon as he did that, the insufficiency of it all became readily apparent.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 So it is with love and hate, and so it is with comfort and terror. If Solraheen is both comforting and terrifying, well, the fault is not with Him. He could, however, be blamed in a roundabout way. He could have chosen to give Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Spark a more complete palette with which to paint an inner world. Instead, Mandri ran confused right through those moments where love and hatred bled together, and he despised having to grapple with the fear of a loving Divine. The end result was always the same: he\u8217\'92d get fed up with all the dissonance and decide to surrender himself to the calm, cool waters of not giving a damn, though that wasn\u8217\'92t really possible either, not completely, and not for long. Not long, at least, whenever he was lost inside a temple mountain, fleeing from the threat of a vengeful Mazyd who no doubt relished the chance to put a beam fire through his skull.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And then there was whatever witchy mumblings Elrahet was whispering as she scampered along in the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This isn\u8217\'92t right. This isn\u8217\'92t right. This isn\u8217\'92t right. That bitch!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl yanked Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm and told him to put his sword away. He didn\u8217\'92t even know he had it out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re going to stab someone,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then who are you going stab? The Mazyd?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93I just feel safer with it out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d feel safer with it sheathed, so sheathe it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri reluctantly sheathed his blade. Good thing he did, because a moment later, Moto took a sharp turn into a dead end and everyone behind bumbled into each other. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are we?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked with venom. Moto, the prime object of her ire, turned from the  and said, \u8220\'93I think we should wait here for Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t act like you }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 meant}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to run in here.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb, who was bringing up the rear, said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no point in waitin\u8217\'92 up for Ayram. He\u8217\'92s dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto dismissed Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dour pronouncement with a sneer, and then he added, for everyone else\u8217\'92s benefit, \u8220\'93Ayram\u8217\'92s not dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is too,\u8221\'94 said Seb. \u8220\'93Consumed by Mazydfire.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He fell down a canyon before the flame even touched him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not what I saw,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You didn\u8217\'92t see shit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah asked Moto, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ayram fell down a canyon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He jumped into it. To escape.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As they argued back Mandri would have preferred the terrified running if it hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t been so dark. It was absurd that it should be this dark. No temple he\u8217\'92d ever been in was so black\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and it wasn\u8217\'92t a matter of no one being around to light the candles or lamps, because there weren\u8217\'92t any fittings bolted to the walls, and the chiseled ceiling was free from the soot of ages, and unlike Minting Rock, there weren\u8217\'92t any holes to let in natural light\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Shulgi was much too thick for that. If, as the Solitants say, the purpose of a temple is to help you lose yourself, then Shulgi performed that function admirably.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was art all along the walls that Mandri was just now noticing. Rows and rows of etchings wrapped around this apparent dead end, and they were stacked upon the each other from floor to the ceiling. The walls all throughout the place were carved and , and painted in shades of black and white. There were battle scenes, with rows and rows of soldiers and slaves poking each other with spears, garden scenes where Old Jandri lord strolled along in quiet contemplation, there were farming scenes of peace and plenty, scenes of Shis and horror, scenes of martyrs screaming Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s name as tongues of flame licked their ribs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri walked along the wall, trying to read the story that was being told. It reminded him of tomb art. Some rich prick decides to spend a fortune decorating the inside of his tomb, and when the tomb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s door is sealed, no one is allowed to look at the piece but him. After a week of putrefaction, his eyes are reduced to brown, gooey prunes, and now no one is looking. A monumental waste.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was never creative. They always asked for the same stories to be painted on their walls. Tell the story of the world, in whatever flavor one agrees with, usually starting with Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s , and then , graven into the inner side of the tomb door is a panel displaying the deceased\u8217\'92s contributions. A dull tradition.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But, ah, wait.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Traditions are cultural memories, borne in the distant past. Maybe that tradition started here at Shulgi, and that long before it was ever the sanctuary of the Greskalun, Shulgi was a tomb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was an interesting idea, but not all the pieces fit. To start, Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quite sure what he was looking at in terms of narrative. He wasn\u8217\'92t even sure if he were reading the panels in the right direction. Should he go from bottom to top, or the other way around? Left to right, or right to left, or was it some other confused schema altogether?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked for a scene which might strike him as familiar, so that he could orient himself. He skimmed through the various displays of beneficence, torture, growth, and decay until he came to the soft edge of the torchlight, a light which blinked every time Moto by frantic arms and hands trying to express an argument. Yet it was there that Mandri found a familiar scene. It was the moment of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s apotheosis, when He emerged out of void. It was represented here by a blank face emerging from a swirl, only, Solraheen did not look so serene, for his brow was troubled by a three-fingered claw mark that dug deep into rock all the way. Each claw was as wide as two fingers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh, guys.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The others were too engrossed in argument to hear him. Moto was dragging the others into the pits of exasperation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri raised his voice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They all stopped bickering and eyed Mandri with a annoyance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at this,\u8221\'94 he said, and he pointed up at the beastly gash in Solraheen\u8217\'92s forehead. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb stepped over, studied the defacement, and shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s just some scratches,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet waddled over and held her torch high. She stood on her tiptoes to get here eye close to the claw mark. Mandri thought he saw her sniff.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When she balanced back on her heels her face gnarled into the deepest of all possible frowns.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is as I feared,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What does that mean?\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet grunted. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It means we need to leave.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then the old witch twirled, black robes fluttering, and trotted off into the darkness, expecting everyone else to follow. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto pushed past Mandri to confront Elrahet. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about Ayram?\u8221\'94, he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet shrugged him off and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ayram can handle himself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But you don\u8217\'92t even know where you\u8217\'92re going!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We make for the Backgate.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To hear Moto say, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But you said you don\u8217\'92t remember\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s protestation was cut short when Elrahet stopped in her tracks and he bumped into her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It doesn\u8217\'92t matter!\u8221\'94 Elrahet declared, and she whacked her conclusion into Moto\u8217\'92s leg with her staff. \u8220\'93The faster we are out of here, the better, and that won\u8217\'92t happen if we\u8217\'92re standing still!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Their journey through the dark began anew with Elrahet leading the way, waving her torch at every dark turn. Here and there she inspected the smudges in the dirt varnish that coated the walls and floor. Whenever there was choice to be made about a path to take, she chose the one that was most likely to lead downwards, because she had a vague memory that the Backgate was, in her words, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93down around there somewhere down there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The further down they went, the wider the ways grew, the staler the air smelled, and the colder the stone felt. It seemed to Mandri that this temple was upside down. A temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ways should be leading up. There should be an ascension to the roof where he could await the coming dawn.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet led them down a wide fan of stairs whose ceiling bowed up into a black void. The noise of their shuffling feet and labored breathing echoed out and echoed back, as if their own ghosts were closing in on them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl muttered, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re going down to Shis.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The ceiling was missing, and so were the walls, as they were now so far apart that the torchlight couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t reach them. Suffice to say, Mandri no longer felt like he was \u8216\'91inside\u8217\'92.  The Ayramun were a splotch of light in a sea of darkness. If not for the hard stone under his feet and the faux-brick pattern on it, he would have supposed, like Purl, that they had wandered straight into the depths of underworld.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I remember now,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said when two enormous, coiled columns appeared ahead. These columns were easily four times the size of those in Shulgi\u8217\'92s entrance hall, and they framed a long tongue of obsidian floor. The group passed by these, and ahead was another pair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto set his torch low to the floor and asked Elrahet, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you make of this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet peered down at the marks with a studious eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was not her that spoke next.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Out of the dark, }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yesssss, whhhhhat do you make of it, wwwwhitch?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 An unaccounted-for voice rates highly on the , higher if it comes echoing out of the dark, higher still if it warbles sickly like a death stealing life. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All who had them drew their swords.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto tossed his torch out along the carpet way. It clattered along the floor, trailing sparks and licks of flame. It slid some distance before coming to a stop at the foot of a stair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s up upshot light was a massive fold of skin. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then the voice rasping spoke again. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You wish to see? Let them see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Two enormous braziers erupted in flame. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Demons. Ten of them. All and twisted form and function. Hideous and frightening, and yet they were of little concern, for sitting at the end of the hall was creature so monstrous that }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The horror of the amalgamete. A small head with a crown. Body bloated beyond belief.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me clarify things further.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Smashes pillar. Crumbles and blocks the way. Pushes them closer towards the demon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ayram\u8230\'85 And good witch Elrahet\u8230\'85.your life\u8217\'92s long journey is at an end.\u8221\'94}

It was as if his flesh was made from cane rubber, and it seemed, in the dim light, that the lump of flesh in his grip was wriggling like a squealing piglet. Thin his fingers let it slip, and his flesh snapped back against his body with a satisfying smack.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 This}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  is the world,\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 said Greskal, rubbing the welling redness. \u8220\'93Do you see? This is the world into which we\u8217\'92re thrown. It chases after you, hunts you, and the whiter the light of your Spark the more this material filth gloms onto it. So I wear this body as proudly as my crown. The sores on neck are pronounced virtue. These boils proclaim me divine. If you had the sight to see my purity, you would supplicate yourselves before me as a god.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet took a step forward.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Most putrid king,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93You are not even worthy of a name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal smiled. His teeth were black and his spit was tar.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A name?\u8221\'94 he asked derisively. \u8220\'93A NAME!? Hah! Keep your names to yourselves.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet looked down her nose at Greskal, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your words are hollow. They mean nothing. .\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A paroxysmal twitch shuddered through Greskal\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face. He pointed to Elrahet and said, \u8220\'93Silence that ensnaring womb.\u8221\'94}
