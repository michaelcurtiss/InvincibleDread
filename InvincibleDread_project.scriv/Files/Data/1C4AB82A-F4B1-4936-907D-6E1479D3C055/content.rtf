\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Some say Sol is a god. Divine plan vs. Not really any different than the rest of us. The proof is in the fact that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s buried under the earth. A true god would plan to be coupling with virgins, not spending a eternity in agony.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Great Soldgi Erg is a sea of sand that scours the eastern rib of the Jandrian continent, and people who grow up within sight of it grow up with the story of how those dunes came to be. Every time the story is told some details are added, some forgotten, and sometimes even the heart of it will change. The only thing that everyone agrees upon is that a god named Sol made those mountains of sand a long time ago, back when he walked the earth alone, and that is why it is called the Great Soldgi Erg. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Sol wanted to build a garden to cover all the land.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen planted a stick in the ground just south of here to mark one of the garden\u8217\'92s six corners.\u8221\'94 Pyetle pointed towards the Soldgi Erg. \u8220\'93He then left to Sol-knows-where to measure out the rest of it. Well, that stake in the ground, that was the accident.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel looked and saw the Pyetle had a twig in his hand. He was poking it into hard, dry earth next to his hip.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Sol planted that stake in the ground and then he left. Then in a few days a little\u8230\'85*hic*\u8230\'85 a little embryo of a sand dune built up in that stick\u8217\'92s lee.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93See it was all by accident. By accident Sol }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 happened}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  to put his stick in }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 just}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  the right spot, and it was left alone for just long enough, that the wind built that little hump of sand higher and higher. It grew wide and tall and in no time at all the first sand dune was born.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 An accident. Sure. Why not? You can\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t tell me that Solraheen }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 meant}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  to turn good black earth into a mountain of sand. And that\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s what happened. While Sol was off wandering in the middle of Sol-knows-where, shaping rivers, mountains, and fields and whatnot, that little dune got large enough to sustain itself. Large enough to not be blown away by the first squall or rainstorm. Then years passed and the Istil wind\u8230\'85 or one of the winds stretched that dune south and east all the way to the southern tip of Corin.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What about all the other dunes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ah, see, that first dune grew tall, so tall that it rippled the wind and created a kind of nursery for neat little rows of dunes behind it. Those littler dunes would grow and grow. Soon they covered the land in all directions. And so them dunes over there came to be. The Great Soldgi Erg.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 You could say it gets harder. Because we have to say that Solraheen not only made a mistake, but he gave up. See the earth over there was once spongy and black. It was good earth. Not like this salty shit that I\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92ve got. Then the good lord stuck his stick in the ground and then - boom - sand. Cleaning it all up was such a task that He just up and left. Decided not to do it. He gave up.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not what happened.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh? Were you there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen knows the winds. He knows the appetite of the sand. He made them. Everyone knows that he pulled the Erg up from the earth. The Soldgi Erg }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  the garden.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle spat a little spittle onto the ground. The earth was so dry and caked by the sun, as hard as fired clay, that the spit just lingered there on the surface. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93See how Solraheen\u8217\'92s golden light shimmers across Sand. A sweet smelling rose or a pink-petaled poppy would only blemish such beauty.\u8221\'94}
