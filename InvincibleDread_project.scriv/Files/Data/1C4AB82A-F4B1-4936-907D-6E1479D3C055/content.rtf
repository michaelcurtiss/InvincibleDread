\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Great Solgi Erg is a sea of sand that scours the eastern rib of the Jandrian continent, and Mandrameen grew up within sight of it, so he grew up with the story of how those dunes came to be. Every time the story was told some details were added, some forgotten, and sometimes even the soul of it changed completely, but the story always started the same: Solraheen made those mountains of sand a long time ago, back when he walked the earth alone. Solitants quip that that is why it is called the Great Solgi Erg, as gi means gift in Old Jandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The stage is then set - primordial earth. A blank, flat canvas for His creation. Next comes the inciting event - Solraheen plants a stick in the ground to mark one of His garden\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s six corners, and then he left to who-knows-where to measure out the rest of it. His passing along the surface of the earth kicked up the first wind, the Shulsai, and this breeze circled the earth and came back around to puff upon the planted stick. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 After an hour, a little embryo of a sand dune built up in the stick\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lee. Another hour more, and the dune swallowed up the stick, for sand attracts sand attracts sand, and soon the Primal Erg was belly-full and rolling across the surface of the world, leaving littler ergs in its wake.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This is where the stories begin to diverge, because people disagree about whether or not all of this was intentional. Those who believe it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t were heretics, and had to tell story in hushed tones and only to discerning company. And they don\u8217\'92t call it the Soldgi Erg. They call it the Soltima Erg - tima akin to shame.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They claimed that if Solraheen had intended for the dunes to form, he would have built them with his own hands, as he did with everything else in his many other gardens. Why should he want to turn good black earth into a mountain of sand? Why should he wander off into the middle of the world and shape rivers with an eye for beauty, and creatures with an eye for complexity, while he left a Erg to struggle up on it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s own, a basic sameness of stuff with no redeeming qualities in the design?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The answer was clear; it had no redeeming qualities because it was not designed at all. All it did was procreate and ripple the wind. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The heretics would go on to say that when Solraheen made it back around the eastern rib of the Jandrian continent and saw what he had accidentally wrought, he panicked and tried to undo it, as evidenced }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He just up and left. Decided not to do it. He gave up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not what happened.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Were they there to see it?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 No. But they have the proof they need. Go out into the Sand and see the rolling dun for yourself and despair.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Solitants, of course, have a different story. They claim that Solraheen knew the winds, he knew the appetite of the sand, for He made them. It is important to remember that every work of art is defined by its process of creation, and Solraheen, in his infinite wisdom, knew that his hands could only make certain kinds of things; the birds of the air, the fish of the sea, human beings, but this was not enough to satisfy his creativity. He is the ultimate draughtsman, capable of works in different styles, and so he set the forces of the wind and sand into action with, and from this come the dunes. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 See how Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s golden light shimmers across Sand? A sweet smelling rose or a pink-petaled poppy would only blemish such beauty, for the dunes themselves are flowers and come in as many varieties.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There are tidal dunes in the lee of hills, echo dunes on the windward side. Crescent dunes, snake dunes, crater dunes rimmed with grass. Go to the and marvel at the array of parabolic arcs spanning , or the parallel ridges of Seedra, drifting across the desert with mathematical elegance. There are stripes, domes, duckfeet, hairpins, scallops, stars, all varying in size in temperament to rival the any family.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The dunes are pigment, the wind is the brush, and if one could see the from, a}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And dunes are sound sculptures. They hiss and moan as they move. In a high wind, the dunes smoke and the air is filled with a booming bellow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The drumming is the avalanching of billions of tiny grains slowing as they reache the bottom of the slip face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Dunes are creators, too. As they drift across the plain their sand shapes rocks, they grind away at the rough edges and leave behind lumps, almost like fecal matter, but some of these rocks are perfectly globular things. These rocks are a metaphor, the Solitants say, for the true purpose of the Sand; it is not there to , but it has purifying heart. It teaches us lessons if we\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re willing to listen, it will grind off our rough outer edges.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Plant a leg in the sand, as Solraheen planted his stick, and the wave you create will become a mountain, it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s passing will resound throughout eternity. That\u8217\'92s the first lesson. Mere existence is enough to change the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a nice thought, but Mandri would always wonder, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Change the world, sure, but change it for the better?\u8221\'94}

Colors in themselves aren\u8217\'92t that interesting, they\u8217\'92re beautiful for a passing moment before the mind turns to , but he was coming around to thinking that what the Solitants said about the desert\u8217\'92s beauty was fundamentally true. At certain times of day the Sand had stark qualities all it\u8217\'92s own.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The common thread of Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ramblings was that he didn\u8217\'92t think highly of human beings. Most of it made sense to Mandri, every mind capable of reason is preoccupied with justifying its own existence.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In the age of city temples, there was an Old Jandri custom that forbade anyone from selling land. The purpose was good-natured, as the wise sages of that age had enough history to diagnose the terminal disease of every city - the diastolic concentration of wealth, precipitating bloody revolution. The idea was that in preventing the sale of land, a family could persist for generations regardless of what wolves were up to. Land changed hands only through inheritance. If an old, childless couple found their work too heavy, they could adopt a few straight-backed persons to till their fields and reap the harvests, and the children could keep it on the condition that they provided grain, oil, and clothes to their parents for as long as the old folks lived.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And what happened to a system of laws so sensibly conceived? Rich landlords seized upon it, bribing judges, capturing councils, and by hook or by crook they forced the poor peasants adopt them as sons, and thus they devoured all arable land by due process of the law.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This practice of consolidation carried on for more than one hundred years. What began as a few rich, wicked schemers evolved into wicked consortiums of \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93sons\u8221\'94 - shared pools of silver and gold from which the poor were forced to drink in times of drought. Such was the upward flow of land, that a single man was once the adopted child of five-hundred and fifty-two different sets of parents. }

Each year, the plaster on the outside walls had to be renewed. The roofs also got a fresh coating of clay. All the clay that had been washed down from walls and roof was depositedi nthestreet, so the street level gradually increased in height.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One evening, share moral stories}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There was a witch who dwelt on a pillar where the sea meets the Saki desert. She gained much fame throughout the land for her talent of divination. If you caught a karkoot lizard, and brought her its stomach in a jar of brine, she would fortell your future. So great were her talents that people hunted karkoots until there were none left. Now, there\u8217\'92s a lot of stories about this witch. The one I find interesting is a story about a carpenter\u8217\'92s son, a profligate child\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that means he was wasteful with his father\u8217\'92s money. Whether it was beer, women, or friends, he spent money without caution. His father wasn\u8217\'92t rich, he was, after all, a carpenter. This boy simply had no respect for the work his father put in to provide him with what he had. In a way, you can\u8217\'92t blame the child. Most of his life he was too young to understand how hard his father worked, and when he was old enough to know, the father\u8217\'92s efforts were out of sight because the father had paid for schooling in another city in the hopes his son would surpass him in society.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, the son, living in a different city, he takes the father\u8217\'92s money that was meant for his education, and instead, he spends it on beer, women, and friends. Ultimately, his life\u8217\'92s prospects come to nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When the father finds out that his own son has beggared them both, his rage\u8230\'85his rage is profound. It might be hard for you two to understand because you don\u8217\'92t have children-\u8220\'93}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Neither do you,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but you see, we Mazid are supremely empathetic creatures\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 not that you aren\u8217\'92t, it\u8217\'92s simply different\u8230\'85let me try to paint the father\u8217\'92s rage for you\u8230\'85I think you two, considering your present circumstances, have some sympathy for the idea that human life is some kind of mistake. It lacks purpose. Contrast that with me, I was built for an explicit purpose, I }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 know}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  what my purpose is. You, however, you must have a nagging sense of the absence of yours. If you }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 do}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  have a purpose, at least we can say that it is not at all clear what that purpose is \hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0  the Solitants admit as much\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and what good does that do you? Think of it like this, if you ever find yourself blessed with wealth and health beyond comprehension, what happens to you then? I can tell you what happens, I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve seen it in pop up in Hrkan royalty. Without anything to distract you, well you think you }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 should}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  be happy now that you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re swimming freely in your natural purpose, but that\u8217\'92s not what happens, what happens is you become bored. Totally bored. A boredom so thorough and complete that people kill themselves. This isn\u8217\'92t despair, it\u8217\'92s boredom. And this is the truth; a human\u8217\'92s natural state is boredom and its unbearable. So what does that say about your intrinsic natures? It says you have no intrinsic purpose.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What does any of this have to do with the carpenter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, this the backdrop to every human struggle. You see, human purpose is }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 crafted, }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 and that means it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s something you can }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 lose}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . And I put it to you that losing your purpose is the greatest horror you can experience. Don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t smile, Mandri, you of all people should know this. You\u8217\'92re so scared to lose your purpose that you won\u8217\'92t even make one in the first place. You\u8217\'92re sitting firmly in that third of all people who got burnt when they were young and have let that little taste of horror clam them up for the rest of their life. This isn\u8217\'92t a value judgment, in fact I think you\u8217\'92re sane to clam up. Then there\u8217\'92s that other third of people, religious types who hide their purpose in the metaphysical realm, so by definition it can\u8217\'92t be lost and so they don\u8217\'92t have to worry about it. Most of the rest make their family their purpose. The carpenter was such a man. His son was his challenge to the void. And he lost. And it wasn\u8217\'92t taken from him, it was }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 squandered}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s worse than if his son were killed, because if his son were killed he could have moved into grief. But no, the father challenged the void, and the void had answered back by corrupting his son, turning him into the living embodiment of his life\u8217\'92s wasted labor. At least, that\u8217\'92s how the father saw it. How could he see different? As Seb might say, the man was who he was. And what did he do? He made a snuffbox and sent it with a messenger to his son. Inside was a note from the father which said, \u8216\'91you are going to die\u8217\'92. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This message freaked the son out. He was a wastrel, but a self-obsessed wastrel; he didn\u8217\'92t want to die. For a month he never slept in the same place twice. He couldn\u8217\'92t enjoy himself. He couldn\u8217\'92t go to taverns or whorehouses for the fear of his father lying in wait. So what did he do? He decided to go and see the witch about it. If she could predict the future, then she could help him avoid his father\u8217\'92s wrath. So he found a karkoot lizard, stuck it in a jar of brine, and set off to see the witch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When he finally set foot in the witches cave, he said to her, \u8216\'91My own father is trying to kill me. What should I do?\u8217\'92 Unfortunately for him, this was the wrong kind of question to ask. The old witch dealt with facts, with certainties about the future. She wanted to hear questions like, \u8216\'91What will happen on third full moon?\u8217\'92, or, \u8216\'91When will the rains come?\u8217\'92, that sort of thing. When someone came along asking for advice, like, \u8216\'91What should I do?\u8217\'92, she got angry. But hers was a silent, vindictive anger. She smoked up and did the whole song and dance for the wastrel son, and when she was done she said to him, \u8216\'91When you leave this place, the first thought that enters your head is what you }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 will}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  do\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Needlessly ambiguous, but that was the point. This witch was old and long in the trade, and she knew what kind of customer this wastrel was and how her response would weigh on him. And it did weigh on him. He jumped to the conclusion that his father was waiting just outside the cave, and that the first \u8216\'91thought\u8217\'92 that would enter his head would be a blade. So he didn\u8217\'92t leave. He stayed right there in that witches\u8217\'92 cave and refused to leave.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The witch of course, tried to shoo him out, but she couldn\u8217\'92t. Her plan had backfired. She was stuck with this idiot who was convinced that the moment he left her cave, he would be struck dead. The witch tried to tell him that his father couldn\u8217\'92t be sitting right outside the mouth of the cave for all eternity, but the son didn\u8217\'92t buy it. It\u8217\'92s not that he thought is father }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 was}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  always watching the cave, but that when he decided to leave, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s precisely when his father would show up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The witch eventually gave up trying to convince the boy that he could walk outside safely, and she told him that he could stay if he did chores for her, like scrubbing the cave floor, cooking, and whatnot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93After many, many years of this, the witch eventually died, and the carpenter\u8217\'92s son was no longer a carpenter\u8217\'92s son. Why? Because he had been the witch\u8217\'92s apprentice. He had learned how to divine the future by watching the witch read the folds in fish stomachs, and so he had become his own man with his own profession. The witch was dead, but people kept coming to the cave anyways. It is said that this former wastrel\u8217\'92s divinations transformed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, for even kings would seek his sight to plan the courses of their wars.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The great irony of all this is that the note the carpenter sent to his son was not a threat. If you remember, the note said, \u8216\'91You are going to die\u8217\'92\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0  that was a mere statement of fact; everybody dies. The father had no intention of hunting down his son. So there\u8217\'92s a sweetness in the knowledge that that simple message did more than any thing the father could have done to shape his son\u8217\'92s life. I don\u8217\'92t know if the father lived long enough to discover that his son had become a great diviner and shaped the course of history, but I like to think that the abatement of his despair would have been most sublime, for he had, unknowingly, triumphed against the void.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wonder if the witch knew that the son would become a diviner.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course she did. She was a diviner. She divined the future and knew what to say to make it happen. The carpenter\u8217\'92s son was as much her son as the carpenters.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why did she try to convince him to leave?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s part of the telling, Mandri, don\u8217\'92t think too much about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, it\u8217\'92s a poor telling.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes lit up. \u8220\'93You think you can do better?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know a story about a son. A godly son. Upright in his parent\u8217\'92s eyes and in Solraheen\u8217\'92s. That is, until the day he met a girl.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Typical\u8221\'94, Purl groaned.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Shameful to relate, the story of a young man kidnapped by demons to a satin bed. The demons stroked his body in the most delicate of embraces, and fondled his uglies with their half-human, half-animal appendages, so as to win a depraved victory over him. Inspired by the grace of Solraheen, the young man bit off his tongue. The emphatic pain, and then the coldness of death, rescued him from his lust.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They asked Purl if she had any stories to tell. She flashed a meek smile and said no. Mandri and Obo wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have it. Mandri said that he would bet the weight of Purl\u8217\'92s pack that she knew at least one story. Obo said that stories are what human beings }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 do}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , so it was impossible that she shouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know any. But the issue wasn\u8217\'92t that Purl didn\u8217\'92t know any stories, it was that she didn\u8217\'92t like how excited she got when she told them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know what,\u8221\'94 said Purl, \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve got a story about a different kind of son. It\u8217\'92s a story about the son of a red-crowned lizard. And red-crown lizards, if you don\u8217\'92t know, like to live in mounds made out of their own shit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not quite true,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is in this story.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now, one lizard son didn\u8217\'92t like living in a mound a shit. His parents asked him, \u8216\'91What\u8217\'92s wrong? Why don\u8217\'92t you like it here?\u8217\'92 and the son said, obviously, \u8216\'91because this place is a mound of shit.\u8217\'92 The father pretended to laugh, and said, \u8216\'91Very funny. Now go fix the front door\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This lizard son was dutiful son, and so he did what his father commanded, he lifted his tail and pooped on front door. Still\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he didn\u8217\'92t like living in a mound of shit. He went back to the father and said, \u8216\'91Why can\u8217\'92t we be like the finches, who live in cups of sticks and moss? Why can\u8217\'92t we be like the rats, who live deep underground in burrows? Why can\u8217\'92t we be like the humans, who live wherever they want?\u8217\'92}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The father said, \u8216\'91We do not have wings, so where are going to get sticks and moss? We do not have digging claws, so how can we dig into the earth? We do not have beer, so how can we live wherever we want? No, my son, we have to count on what we do have, and what we do have is poop.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Dutifully, the son chewed a hole in the living room wall. His mouth was full of his family\u8217\'92s leavings, and he realized, now more than ever, that he didn\u8217\'92t like living in a mound of shit. He decided then and there that enough was enough and he was going to leave. So he wiggled out and set off into the desert.\u8217\'92}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He didn\u8217\'92t return home for five years, which, for a red-crown lizard, made him old enough to be a grandfather. His parents were long dead. One of his lizard sisters now owned the mound.\u8217\'92}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The sister, trying to be a most gracious host, invited her long lost brother inside for dinner. The brother declined. When the sister asked why, the brother answered, \u8216\'91Because you live in a mound of shit. I\u8217\'92ve traveled the world and have slept in the houses of birds, and rats, and humans, and I\u8217\'92ve even snuck into a snake\u8217\'92s den! None of them were so foul as this.\u8217\'92}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The sister said, \u8216\'91Come now, brother, it\u8217\'92s not that bad. We\u8217\'92ve added a second floor.\u8217\'92 The brother said, \u8216\'91No thank, you,\u8217\'92 and he left. As he left, he heard his sister shout at one of her many children, saying, \u8216\'91The floor should be clean enough to eat off!\u8217\'92}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The old brother was sad at this parting. After all the glorious homes he\u8217\'92d seen, it hurt to see his sister and her family living in such squalor. He decided to do something about it. He thought that all they needed was a push out the door and they\u8217\'92d see for themselves that a mound of shit is the worst kind of house to live in.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So he journeyed back to the snake whose home he\u8217\'92d snuck into. This time, however, he revealed himself to the snake. He said to the snake, \u8216\'91I know you want to eat me, but if you can hold your appetite, I will lead you to a mound of shit that is crawling with lizards. It will be the easiest feast of your life.\u8217\'92}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The snake was skeptical.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The snake wasn\u8217\'92t sure if he wanted to do it.

But the promise of an easy meal was too good to pass up, so he said to the old lizard, \u8216\'91lead on\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The lizard led the snake back to his sister\u8217\'92s home, and the snake did what he promised.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 After a week they came into to the Tib desert, or the Black desert, for it was a black plain with a hard floor of small stones tarred in rock-varnish. These stones were inset into the earth, and tightly interlocked like a Hrkan road.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In the hours of the afternoon sun, the rocks underfoot were hot enough to blister bare skin in seconds. The stones were smooth, but such was the heat that traveling here would wear holes in the shoes. And this seemed to slow their progress.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They walked the Tib, south and east, and day after day they moved forward and nothing changed. Always the same,  }

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nights in the Tib were spent huddled around three twiggy fires. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the heat that provided comfort, though the nights were cold, it was the smell, for suspended above these miniature fires were a tin bowls filled with scented wax, smelling of carrion, and in the mornings, the hardened wax would be thick with the fuzzy brown bodies of cusiloe flys who were looking for meat in which to implant their eggs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The flies live in the earth, squeezed deep into the crevices of the interlocking rocks, and the odors of flesh, living or otherwise, draws them from hibernation - but only at night. Like reasonable creatures, they don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t come out to bake in the sun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As soon as the red lip of the sun peeks up in the east, everyone rises and checks themselves to make sure they hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t been impregnated. If a fly did get under the skin, and the eggs were allowed to hatch, removing them would be a painful ordeal, potentially fatal. Seb described the larvae - pulsing white thumbs with two fangs the length of fingernails. Pull them out and they can rip the flesh and leave a hole that will get infected. You look for them by feeling. Skin is too dark to see the soft little welts, especially Moto and Moteah's skin, so you\u8217\'92ve got to feel around for a hardened, coin-sized bump, like a callous on the palm, but maybe it\u8217\'92s on your thigh, on your prick, in your armpit, upon your back, and since you can\u8217\'92t reach your back you\u8217\'92ve got to have someone else do it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah and Moto checked each other. Ayram and Elrahet checked each other. Mandri smiled at Purl but this was not reciprocated. He was paired with Seb, and neither were happy about the arrangement, Mandri because Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fingers were oily, and Seb because he thought Mandri might miss a . }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah checked Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nobody checked Obo. He said the flies wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t bother him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d scrape the paste of dead flies from the surface of the wax, save them for food, and then they\u8217\'92d be on their way again, a short sprint in the half-light hours betwixt the sun and the moon. When the sun rose again, they\u8217\'92d stop, pitch little shelters, and rest until worst of the heat had passed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a lurching way to travel, and it felt to Mandri that they made no progress. Day after day and scenery did not change at all. To the north, a flat plain of pebbles for as far as the eye could see. To the south, a flat plain for as far as the eye could see. To the east and to the west it was the same - flat for as far as the eye could see. They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d walk at a hurried pace for hours, they\u8217\'92d stop, and Mandri could swear he saw the same damn pattern of rocks that he\u8217\'92d seen four times before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moving like this, out of rhythm and in unfamiliar hours, skating on the surface of an endless black stone sea, it changed the perception of time. There were no new spikes of memory around which an hour could congeal. No new sights, no new sounds, and no new conversations because the heat of the day and the cold of night tempered everyone into the same person; short responses, shrugging shoulders, faces set in the same tight-lipped frown that said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I just want to get through it\u8221\'94. And that\u8217\'92s who everyone was, bundled, muddled balls of just-get-through-it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Except for Obo, of course. Obo remained genial and solicitous.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fretful eye glancing north, looking for Hrks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was nowhere to hide in this desert. If they ever came, he would see them, and they would definitely see him, walking pillar that he was. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 No one could see the Hrks, but they could see Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s worry. Their pace quickened, and they stayed moving until anyone spotted the first cusiloe fly crack out of the ground.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A ray of joy strafed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s heart when he saw the brown peaks of the Goree mountains. They came up all at once, a long, dark lumpy line waiting there on the horizon. Still no sign of the Hrks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They pushed through the sun, and evening brought them to the mountain\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet, for the Goree had no hills, it was flat land all the way up to their bases, with a dust of red-iron dirt filled in the recesses between the pebbles, and then covered them up completely by the time that reached red rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The mountains themselves were buttresses against the desert wind, and as such their mottled red faces looked they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d just been attacked by claws the size of a river. Deep, scoring cuts, sweep, like great, static Ergs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram led them south, and now that they were safe from flies, he led them long into the night. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri whispered to Purl, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if the pass is north of here? How does he know which way to go? \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He remembers it,\u8221\'94 said Purl, as if that were a perfectly reasonable thing to say.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But there was just no way that Ayram could have dead-reckoned it all the from Minting Rock. The featureless Tib would have made that impossible, and the arc of the sun was more of a guideline than a precise measure.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He should ask the man himself, but Mandri decided not to, and good thing too, because the next person who spoke drew Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ire.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He had to poop.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram shushed him, but Seb insisted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re the one that made me eat those flies!\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright!\u8221\'94 Ayram exclaimed, and he stopped the train. \u8220\'93Just be quick and quiet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It ain\u8217\'92t gonna be quiet, I can tell ya that. Matter of fact, ain\u8217\'92t gonna be quick, either.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb sauntered off into the rocks, and disappeared amongst the shadows.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri dumped Obo onto the ground, then went to Moto and asked for some twigs to make a fire to calm the night chill.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No fires,\u8221\'94 Ayram said.}

See, there\u8217\'92s two kinds tribes in the Goree: those who want to kill you, and those who want to steal your stuff. Either way, you end up dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, if they\u8217\'92re up in the mountains, won\u8217\'92t they have seen us coming from miles away?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Probably not, actually. There\u8217\'92s not much reason for them to be watching the Tib, because it\u8217\'92s not a journey often made. We might have slipped through and if we have, don\u8217\'92t want to spoil it with a fire.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There was once a tribe called the Old Believers. They lived in an alluvial plain just south of . They had strange ways of worshiping Solraheen, so to incorporate them into world of Hrk we had to reform their religion. The plan was to do it piecemeal, over generations, so as not to cause a stir. Don\u8217\'92t start with the relgion itself, start with some of the customs to soften them up. The first thing we did is we told them to not write Solraheen with two L\u8217\'92s. And we told them to use an open thumb when they make the sign of the brothers.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They built warehouses out of resin-rich timber, locked themselves inside, and then burnt it all down.
