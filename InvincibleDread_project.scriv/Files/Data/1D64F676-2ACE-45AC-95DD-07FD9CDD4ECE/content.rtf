\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The neolithic revolution that took our ancestors from hunting and gathering in small kinship-based bands to a settled, communal village life of subsistence agriculture was the greatest ever mass-destroyer of skills, cultures and languages in human history. No band of hunter gatherers can have simply given up all they knew and settled down to sedentary farming without engaging in a giant battle of ideas.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To the author of Genesis, the neolithic revolution signified the fall of man: \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91Cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field.

Walking alongside farmers dressed in their linnen or wool sarongs, carrying their hoes, rake, clod-mallets, and ditch-spades over their shoulders, some leading panniered donkeys or dangling their legs over the sides of creaking ox-carts with four solid wooden wheels, each cleverly crafted from three sections - a simple slice of log would allow the soft outer sapwood to wear away too quickly.}

\par\plain {Now you pass out through the high gateway that pierces the towering brick wall of your home city. Immediately beyond you find orchards and vegetable gardens, planted with apple trees and grapevines for fruit, as well as flax and sesame for fibre and oil, and a plentiful variety of vegetables and legumes , beans, chickpeas, cucumber, garlic, leeks, lentils, lettuce, mustard, onions, turnips, and watercress, plus diverse herbs and spices like corianer, cumin, mint, and juniper berries. Ducks and gees raised for eggs adn meat, eventually joined by chickens somehwat later. Here and there stand isolated groves, mostely date palms, important to the local diet, although you would also see poplar, willow tamarisk and dogwood, grown for timber, which is always in short supply. }
\par\plain {As you leave the city behind, you pass field upon field of grain, stretching away as far as your eyes can see on either  side of the trackway. More barley than wheat, because barley is more salt tolerant, and the land has never fully recovered from the salination of the previous era. A network of broad and navigable canals, narrower flumes, tight and muddy ditches, finger their way among the fields to water the crop that is the staff of sumerian life.}

These were connected to form a city-wide wast disposal system with its outfall sloping parallel to the natural fallof the ground, the outlet being located well beyond the city walls.}

\par\plain {In the sumerian times, politics, and its extension, war, were perceived to be the business of the gods; men acted only on the gods behalf. Thus the Sumerian Hundred Years War was between Ningirsu of Lagash and the god Shara of Umma. Men fought and died and cities were destroyed, but the actual argument was between the gods. Was fought over a patch of land, called Gu-Edin, the edge of hte steppe. Grazing landn for animals was always in shorter supply and more contested than plots for raising crops. With the land immediate given over to the growing of grain, livestock had to be fed on the steppe beyond. But cattle and sheep, if contained within too small an area, quickly reduce it to uselessness. Cattle eat the green leaves of bushes and trees and also bark, while sheep nibble newly growing shoots and undergrowth. Once the natural herbage of the steppe has been destroyed by the flocks, the only use fr the land is to give it over to agriculture. Thus, two cities which may initially have been at a comfortable distance apart would find themselves in dispute, not over agri land, but for residual steppe used for grazing. Separation by 30 km led them to collision.}

The graves themselves are part of the effort made by urs rulers to establish the legitimacy of their governance by demonstrating their sacred, holy, and non-ordinary status. E.g. public punishment of william wallace, dragged naked behind a horse through the city of london to the market at smithfield, where he was hanged, cut own while still living, castrated, disembowelled, innards burned before his eyes before being decapitated - turn a commonplace offence - military resistance - into a crime of spiritual proportions: treason against a divinely appointed ruler.}
