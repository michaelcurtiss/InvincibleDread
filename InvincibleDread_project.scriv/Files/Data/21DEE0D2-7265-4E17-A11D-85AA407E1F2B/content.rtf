A dancer, a poet, these are artists, yes, that\u8217\'92s reasonable to say, but a hole-digger can be an artist too if he digs holes in a way that\u8217\'92s true to himself, whatever that may mean. Even a tax-man can be an artist if he\u8217\'92s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of. One might say that all tax men artists.}
\par\plain {A true artist, though, that is a term of distinction which has nothing at all to do with the choice of medium, whether it be dancing, digging, or finessing balance sheets. In fact, some true artists never actually produce anything in their lives at all, yet true artists they most certainly are because true artistry is a state of mind, one marked by too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and such an inflated sense of their own self that it becomes impossible to describe them without resorting to sarcasm.}
\par\plain {Mandrameen was such an artist. He did make things, for whatever that is worth, but as a true artist, he is remembered in Hrkan circles for the way he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d strut around and make grand pronouncements about his own work. Hrkan circles coped with this by strutting around in kind, repeating Mandri\u8217\'92s words and following them up with something like a wink. }
\par\plain {A man would stand in front of one his paintings and say, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This piece really moves me,\u8221\'94 and then make a show of walking away. }
\par\plain {Or he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d say, \u8220\'93I weep at every stroke of color,\u8221\'94 and then flash a knowing smile. }
\par\plain {Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t mind because he knew he was a safe target for playful derision, maybe he was the only safe target, because it wasn\u8217\'92t really him they were making fun of, it was his famous artist\u8217\'92s temperament. After all, it takes a certain kind of person to put themselves in front of others and push through the barbs. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to live a life of sad obscurity.}
\par\plain {Now, none of that is necessarily true, but the truth of it doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t matter. The point is that Mandri believed that skilled artists are all pricks and they tend to say prickish things and he was a skilled artist. It was perfectly natural for him to say to a young Hrkan prince, \u8220\'93You haven\u8217\'92t the faintest idea of what you\u8217\'92re talking about.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {The prince\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s crime? He said he liked a painting that he shouldn\u8217\'92t have. Lordship be damned, Mandri\u8217\'92s knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if he wasn\u8217\'92t correct in the literal, figurative, spiritual sense, he was at least \u8220\'93more correct\u8221\'94 than whoever he was talking to, and that was good enough.}
\par\plain {That is, perhaps, the best way to come to terms with Mandrameen, he was a young man who stared reality straight in the face and claimed, with all the certainty of a Solitant priest, that subjectivity does not exist, that he alone had access to a higher truth, because he alone had put in the hours necessary to realize it.}
\par\plain {This miracle of denial seems like it shouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be possible. Two people look at the same painting and walk away disagreeing about its worth. What are you gonna do? Ask Mandrameen about it, and he\u8217\'92d bob his narrow face, run his fingers through his flouncy black hair, sigh like the weight of he world was on his shoulders, and then he\u8217\'92d say that one of those people was wrong. Maybe both were idiots. He\u8217\'92d tell you who was what once he\u8217\'92d seen the painting for himself.}
\par\plain {And Mandri knew he was right because he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d lived all his bright-eyed years being told he was Solraheen\u8217\'92s gift to humanity, and it wasn\u8217\'92t just his grandmother saying this, it was everyone. They said it because Mandrameen, at the age of ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters.}
\par\plain {These were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brushstrokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait, he observed a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of color he could define the skin, the cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, and even the mood of the piece. A single stroke! He once painted a woman, cleavage up, using only twelve - count them, twelve - strokes. There were few extra daubs here and there to make the eyes glisten, but those hardly counted. Nobody noticed them. It didn\u8217\'92t stop scribes from marveling at how he packed so much information into slaps of pigment. }
\par\plain {\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93These are the marks of genius,\u8221\'94 they\u8217\'92d say. Wink, wink.}
\par\plain {But all shooting stars eventually fall. In Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s case it wasn\u8217\'92t so much a \u8216\'91fall\u8217\'92 as it was a gradual decline. It might\u8217\'92ve been different, but in his own words, he refused debase himself by doing what it takes to succeed.}
\par\plain {See, Mandri was a painter, and in such a craft there are limits. Once you achieve a certain degree of skill, everyone is more or less as good as everyone else, and outside of true genius, the only thing that separates professionals is how willing they are to ingratiate themselves with governors, princes, and priests. Success has little to do with quality, or skill. Maybe novelty plays a role, but mostly it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s about preening tongues and critic\u8217\'92s pens. It was about how many people knew the raw fact of your existence. It was about manufacturing popularity any way that you can. Being the true artist that Mandri was, he refused to play this game. So, he walked away from the craft and dived headfirst into hallucinogenic drugs.}
\par\plain {The very first time that Mandri picked some brown burgeons, crushed them up, and smoked their dried juices instead of using them for pigment, he came to a life-changing conclusion: Art was essentially pointless. }
\par\plain {Obviously pointless. }
\par\plain {Every artist who has ever tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed.}
\par\plain {That was an undeniable fact.}
\par\plain {Mandri had traveled to every city on the holy continent, and he had seen every painting and every sculpture worth seeing and they all fell short of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s creation. Naturally, this included his own work - first and foremost his own work. And the problem was always the same: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see. When it comes to Nature, well, it\u8217\'92s complex. If artists were smart, they might be able to approach this complexity with, but artists are people, and people are dumb, so they boil that complexity down into something digestible. They boil it down to a single tangible lump which has got them transfixed; In Mandri\u8217\'92s case that usually meant a nice pair of tits. A pretty face could suffice. Maybe it\u8217\'92d be a flower. What matters is that he\u8217\'92d try to rip the thing from the fabric of reality and stitch it\u8217\'92s hide to a frame, and then he would hold that up as if he really had captured and killed the thing that makes life worth living, and people would actually buy it. Some plucky merchant without a brain, who\u8217\'92d lived a life of comfort, would buy it and mount it on his wall. Mandri walk in to see it and be struck dumb by the feeling that the piece was better suited to the floor, next to the sprawling, headless hides of lizards. It belongs with the pretty colors because that\u8217\'92s all it is.}
\par\plain {The commissions tore at him. Paint an oasis, and in so doing he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have to reduce a palm leaf to a fleck of green. The beauty of a living leaf, its complexity, its pattern, its anatomosing veins pumped full of vital fluids, its birth and death and eventual decay, the role it plays on the branch, the branch on the tree, the system within a system, a whole universe unto itself nested inside a greater one - all that complexity, that beauty revealed to him by burgeonsight, was reduced to a fleck of green.}
\par\plain {Reduced, because again, the artist has something more important he wants you to look at. There\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a naked woman bathing in the mossy water. There\u8217\'92s no need to properly render the leaf. In fact, rendering that leaf, giving it light and shadow and form, that would only distract the eye from the droplets of jade gleaming on her cinnamon skin. The sensible thing to do, if you must paint the leaf, is to slightly feather its edge into the sky so that eye doesn\u8217\'92t get caught on a hard line of verdant green set against a chalky blue. Maybe remove the leaf and the tree altogether if the thing doesn\u8217\'92t slide a wandering eye down towards the temptress\u8217\'92 bare shoulder. And then you\u8217\'92ve really done it, you\u8217\'92ve not only reduced the leaf down to a daub of color, you\u8217\'92ve erased it from existence entirely.}
\par\plain {And it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t just the leaf, it was the rock, the cloud, and the tree, and how it all fit together. Even the sand played a role. The true part of Nature\u8217\'92s beauty, the grandeur and complexity of it, was absent. Maybe one can say that Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t trying to paint Nature, he was trying to paint a woman, and so of course he wouldn\u8217\'92t capture Nature essence, but that hardly matters. \u8220\'93Go and try and paint Nature,\u8221\'94 Mandri would say to Meskalim\u8217\'92s frightened children during a burgeon binge. \u8220\'93Try reducing that infinitely nested beauty to a still image, to a brushstroke. Take as long as you like. Take twenty five years. Take a lifetime! Take ten lifetimes! Then\u8230\'85 and then\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {And then he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d forget what he was on about.}
\par\plain {If he were sober, he would have said something about standing at the edge of the wilderness, a place with a big sky and mountains. Smoke some valley burgeons to get in the mood, and then let the shock of Nature\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s overwhelming beauty hit the spinal cord. If the mood is right, it will hit with an intensity that no poet or painter could ever hope to achieve. So, there was no point in trying.}
\par\pard\plain \tx0\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Made his real living by giving portraiture lessons to wealth man Vigram Druamalun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram was an old, burly gentleman with a bald head and long belly-beard that he kept oiled and neatly trimmed. He lived in the countryside, near Meskalim, for he was rich enough to afford a private villa set away from the dirty city, and he could afford to staff it with serving boys and a tiny private army - if twelve skinny men with knobby spears could be called an army. Vigram called them an army. He made them wear a square tin brooch on their robes and this brooch bore his initials.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram could afford all this because he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d made a small fortune as a creditor. He told the story to Mandrameen at lunches, and he\u8217\'92 d tell it in a way so as to suggest to Mandri that he could do it too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He started with only two ounces of silver as inheritance. Then he loaned those four ounces to two brothers who ran a bakery in Meskalim. This bakery supplied the Solitant temple with bread - a surefire bet, because temples were always the last thing to go belly up in lean times. There were gross accusations of usury against Solraheen Himself, but Vigram got together with the priest and prayed about it around a .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 After that, he lent smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who needed emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim\u8217\'92s budding bond market. There wasn\u8217\'92t much money in Meskalim itself, but it had a busy port and that meant access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 From there, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d wax on about his many investments, a web of silver that stretched into every corner of the continent, and it was all self-sustaining. Soon he was able to hire people to pour over the lists of sums credited and debts owed, and this allowed him idle hours, which he spent dabbling in the sacred art of the oil portrait.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His favored subject was his young daughter, Ora, who was Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s age. She was the only one of his five children willing to sit for him, and on the present day, Vigram brought out Ora and said to Mandri, \u8220\'93Isn\u8217\'92t she a subject fit for holy oils?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen nodded politely and said yes, and his eyes flicked to Ora without intention, but Vigram interpreted it as the most rabid of intentions, and the old man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes squeezed a smile and then he gave Mandri a partriarchal nod of blessing. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t care much for Ora. She was good natured, but she was a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen, easily twice his size. Her face was fair enough, and she had clean brown skin and a sun-kissed smile, but while she might pass for a fertility goddess, Mandri didn\u8217\'92t want to have kids.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Vigram set up an easel on a red-brick patio that abutted his villa\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s western wall. Mandri had told Vigram at least four times that this was a horrible place to paint. The patio was enclosed by a diamond trellis that was crawling with vines, and that meant dappled light, and dappled light was horrible for a beginner because the sun moves. It\u8217\'92s easily accounted for in clean light, but with the leafy shadows drifting across the face it\u8217\'92s horrible. Vigram thought he had an artist\u8217\'92s eye, and so he insisted on it. He shook his beard and said, \u8220\'93My dear Mandri, the patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know what that meant, and he didn\u8217\'92t ask. He did what he was told and helped Ora up onto a high-legged chair, and Ora let her sausage fingers linger on his arm, and then Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his subject.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Again, Mandri did as told, and Vigram set himself to mapping out the canvas with a stick of charcoal.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Mandri got around to see how Vigram was getting on, he had to stifle a burst of laughter, because Vigram was having a hell of a time fitting plump Ora into the frame.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That was Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fault, though, not Vigram\u8217\'92s (or Ora\u8217\'92s). Mandri had previously told Vigram to try and use the whole canvas, because Vigram had a beginners habit of drawing the figure small and in the center, leaving an awkward expanse of emptiness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think the shoulders should be a little lower,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, yes you\u8217\'92re right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram rubbed his marks away with his palm, then tried to readjust.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once the , Vigram set the charcoal aside, picked up his palette which Mandri had already prepared, and set himself to painting.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a old maxim that says that talented people don\u8217\'92t know how to teache . Mandri thought he understood the reasoning; folks who don\u8217\'92t know think that talented people didn\u8217\'92t have to try to acquire their skills. So, they think Mandri never had to actually learn, and so how could he communicate the secrets of the craft when it all comes instinctively? }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But Mandri knew exactly what was wrong Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s paintings. If there were any difficulties in the communication, it was because the average human being can\u8217\'92t handle an unvarnished critique. So, it becomes an exercise in patience and pretending. Mandri found it was best to start off with a compliment.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He nodded, and then said \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s good.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then he crossed his arms and his eyes raced around the painting, pretending to take in the interesting observations that Vigram had put there in that blur of muddy color. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram had a habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes. Oils dry too slow for that, and Mandri had stressed several times for him to get the color right on the palette before he touched the canvas, because that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what the pallette is there for. But time and time again, Vigram would mix a bluish shade of pink for Ora\u8217\'92s chin. It\u8217\'92s a color that only works for the chin a man who keeps a close shave. Vigram would slap it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes would dart between the girl and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips would curl into a frown and he\u8217\'92d mutter to himself, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not quite right.\u8221\'94 Then he\u8217\'92d stab his brush into a slug of red, rub it onto the girl\u8217\'92s manly chin, and of course, that wouldn\u8217\'92t be quite right either. This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But the colors weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t Vigram\u8217\'92s core problem. Colors could come later. Before that there was issue of value - the man didn\u8217\'92t know how to handle dark and light to shape dimensions. But even before that, there was the simple act of drawing. One has to be able make a thing look like what it looks like.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri repeated the compliment, because Vigram looked like he needed it. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No really, it\u8217\'92s good. I mean, it\u8217\'92s not a masterpiece, but it\u8217\'92s\u8230\'85 it\u8217\'92s on the path.\u8221\'94 He followed it up with some meat. \u8220\'93But do you remember what I said last week?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You said that I need to learn to draw hands,\u8221\'94 said Vigram, smiling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And have you done that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nope!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. They both looked at the painting\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hands - the fingers looked like chicken scratches. Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t help but smile. Ora smiled too, awkwardly, a distant third leg in the conversation. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said to Vigram, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you aren\u8217\'92t going take what I say to heart, then what\u8217\'92s the point of me coming?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry, Mandri, but hands are boring to paint. If a hand had one or two fingers it\u8217\'92d be a different matter entirely. As it is, they\u8217\'92re difficult things to draw.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Getting good at anything is difficult.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not for everyone,\u8221\'94 Vigram spared him a wink.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Vigram, if you truly want to get better, you have to fight against the urge to be lazy. You have to }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 want}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to try, and in painting, what \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91trying\u8217\'92 means is putting in the time and effort to learn how to draw hands.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know, I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve said this before - when it comes to a portrait, the only things that matter are the face and the hands. You could give Ora forty ribs and a single breast, and people will forgive you for it, so long as you\u8217\'92ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, anatomically correct hands.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll do better with the hands.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You say that, but I feel like next time I come over, you won\u8217\'92t have drawn a single hand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Probably.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his tired brow. He found it difficult to teach when the student wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t interested in learning. There\u8217\'92s got to be an existential threat to get better, or else it will never happen.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before the mood could get too testy, one of Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spearmen marched onto the patio.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stopped his feet, like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen hrkan soldiers do, and he said, \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry to interrupt, my lord.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The young master\u8217\'92s ox is eating the apples.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier pointed an accusing finger towards the field beyond the trellis, and all eyes turned to peer through the windows in the vines. There, some twenty meters away, Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s golden ox, named Gil, was craning his head up high reach. The beast\u8217\'92s tongue was stuck out and twirling. He was trying to lick the apple stems off the branches, but the present apple was just a little too high up, and his tongue ended up just batting the unripe fruit around.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram turned to Mandri, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gil\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. He stared back through the vines with that dumb, bovine ogle as the slobber dripped unheeded from his thick upper lip. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gil!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Gil blinked. A second later he real Something clicked in his mind and he trotted over, dewflap flapping, ribs seeming to roll underneath his spine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Poor old creature,\u8221\'94 Vigram muttered.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve got a gift, Mandri. I\u8217\'92m serious. Solraheen\u8217\'92s given you a gift.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m serious!\u8221\'94 Vigram said, \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve been given a gift!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri waved back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a gift, unless that gift was patience. His paintings were famous (regionally famous), for the economy of strokes, but what people didn\u8217\'92t know is that he would spend hours making those single strokes. He\u8217\'92d put one down, and if it wasn\u8217\'92t exactly right, he\u8217\'92d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and repeat this for as long as it took. He mixed his paints with a few drops of sap to make the strokes dry quicker so this worked. So, in truth, Mandri\u8217\'92s only real talent, the only thing separating him from everyone else, was his tolerance of tedium. That\u8217\'92s the secret. Talent is just . Some people call that passion, and maybe that\u8217\'92s what it was, but all Mandri knew was that he no longer had it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he and Gil got to the top of a hill that overlooked Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s villa, he saw that Vigram was still standing in his drive, looking after him. Vigram waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, \u8220\'93No burgeons, Mandri!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, yeah,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered under his breath.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re gonna fry your mind!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t about to get into an argument at that kind of distance, so he waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem\u8217\'92s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons with the money Vigram had given him, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. Mandri was a little disappointed because the only stuff Geem had were south valley burgeons, decent stuff but the the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle, so the insides had a tendency to dry out quick, too quick for Mandri\u8217\'92s liking, but that was all Geem had so he bought them. Then he and Gil continued along the road, stomping through the wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, until they made it out his dusty farm at nightfall. }}
