\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri tried fighting, he tried running away, he even tried dying - none of it worked. No matter what he did, he couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t get away from well-adjusted people. Now here he was, shouldering a knobby sack of stuff that wasn\u8217\'92t his on a forsaken road some inestimable distance away from civilization, and there was Moto Mundi, striding alongside him. And Moto wasn\u8217\'92t just a well-adjusted person, he was good-and-well-adjusted. There\u8217\'92s a difference. It\u8217\'92s worse.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 All the other Ayramun were oddballs. Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s sister, Moteah, was well-adjusted too, but Mandri liked to look at her so he gave her a pass. So in effect there was just one person amongst the thirteen Ayramun that Mandri knew he wouldn\u8217\'92t like. There was a decent chance Mandri he wouldn\u8217\'92t like any of the Ayramun once he got to know them, but Moto, that was a man that Mandri could hate on principle. That principle being, of course, that well-adjusted people are assholes.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The signs were there on the surface, with Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s flawless black skin, his clean and even features, his chiseled jaw, his height, his broad shoulders, his bright eyes looking at the world like it\u8217\'92s just a game. Even when standing still he was dynamic, a slight swerve of coiled strength like the muscled statues of Zos - firmly fixed in granite yet about to burst into action. And is garb was disgustingly fashionable, tucked and folded to compose a pattern of inverted triangles that accentuated the athletic V of his torso. The dress was an affront to the struggle for survival out in the desert. Everyone else was done up in rags by comparison (excepting Moteah). Moto even had a sword with a gold plated hilt. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The sum of the effort put into his appearance might lead one to believe that Moto cared what other people thought of him, and if that were the case Mandri might have been able to stand him. No, Moto was well-adjusted, and well-adjusted people don\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t really consider others to be sentient beings - that\u8217\'92s what makes them well-adjusted. If you take other people\u8217\'92s feelings into consideration, or how they might be judging you, well that leads to doubt, and that leads to indecision, and snip-snap it becomes a habit, leaving one anxious, uneasy, and more to the point, having to adjust themselves. As far as Mandri was concerned, that\u8217\'92s where empathy leads, it leads to a vicious, unceasing cycle of adjustment and so a well-adjusted person, by definition, lacks empathy, meaning they\u8217\'92re all assholes. So, Moto looked the way he did for no other reason than because it pleased him, and that made him an asshole. Well, it didn\u8217\'92t }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 make}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  him an asshole - it was a sign. Most people who look so pretty are only pretending to be well-adjusted. Mandri knew Moto was the real thing because of how he laughed.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The two were walking side by side and Mandri said out loud that he wondered where they were going. Moto said that they were following the road. Mandri didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t see any road, so he asked, \u8220\'93What road?\u8221\'94, and then Moto laughed.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Laughs come in infinite flavors so they can be hard to place. This laugh was one that Mandri had a special sensitivity to. It was the laugh of someone who\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s well-adjusted laughing at someone who\u8217\'92s not. It comes with a twinge of disbelief. There\u8217\'92s a note of derision. Not necessarily loud, it\u8217\'92s a simple, lively, full-bodied, challenging,\u8220\'93Hah!\u8221\'94 that leaves a bitter afterthought. Mandri would have preferred Moto to just say you\u8217\'92re-out-of-place and be done with it.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto then turned that twinge of disbelief into a question. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re saying you don\u8217\'92t know about charnel roads?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t answer. He kept his eyes down, hoping the Moto might go silent as well.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93This is the Bazul Road,\u8221\'94 Moto said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri only saw dirt. He looked forward, left and right, and there was more dirt. Yes, roads were made of dirt, but they had sides to them, or at least a waystone, or wheelruts - some sign of a thing passing through. Even lizard trails through shrubby brush carved clearly defined paths where green things didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t grow. There was none of that here. You had step over the little grey shrubs, you had to walk around sunken pits of clay. The only thing that suggested a road were the tracks of the Ayramun who were walking ahead of him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t see it,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Of course you don\u8217\'92t see it,\u8221\'94 Moto answered. \u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t know what to look for. But it\u8217\'92s here. The whole Sand is webbed by charnel roads just like this one.\u8221\'94 Moto kicked the ground, as if doing so made the road\u8217\'92s existence more believable. Mandri began to wonder if Moto was trying to put him up and make him look a fool.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re ancient things,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93Let me ask you, if you had to build a road in a rainy place, how would you build it?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What do you mean by \u8216\'91a rainy place\u8217\'92?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Used to rain here when this road was built.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How long ago was that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Just answer the question. If you had to build a road in a rainy place, how would you build it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I guess I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto clicked his tongue in disgust. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93If I ask you a question at least try to answer it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I really don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93\u8216\'91I don\u8217\'92t know. I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8217\'92Give it some thought. Think. Do you a think?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Of course I think.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Then look like it, cause you look dumb. You looking like it hurts to think.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri shrugged.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I told you everything you need to know to be able to see the road, so look for the road.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri saw the road almost immediately but didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t want to give Moto the satisfaction of having shown him something, so the two walked on in silence for a finger as Mandri pretended to look for a clue. But it was there, the Bazul Road. It was the gentlest raised hump of earth and it snaked on ahead into the distance; a slope so slight and obscured by brush that it was easy to miss, and it was wide, at least twelve men across, so wide that it was easy to mistake for a natural deposit of dirt blown in from one of the Hazisads, one of the sandstorms which the heat whips up in the summer and spins aimlessly in the Sand for weeks. Mandri thought that a natural explanation like a storm was a much more reasonable explanation for this \u8216\'91road\u8217\'92. It was just too big, and went on too far. More likely it was the result of some tectonic shift of rock than mere men slaving away. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t about to voice his opinion, though. Instead he furrowed his brow, looked at nothing in particular, scratched his chin and took as much pleasure as he could in the mild anticipation building in Moto\u8217\'92s stare before finally shrugging and saying, \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t see it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The tall Zosan recoiled in shock.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Are you dumb?\u8221\'94 Moto asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The bluntness of it made Mandri laugh. That tapered off when as soon as Mandri realized that Moto was serious. The man really thought he was dumb.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not dumb. I just don\u8217\'92t - what does it matter whether or not I can see the road? Is this some kind of test?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It wasn\u8217\'92t before, but now it is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well what does it matter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93A man needs to know if his traveling companion is dumb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sighed in frustration. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Let me start on a different foot here, Mandri: I don\u8217\'92t care about you at all. Ayram has saddled me with the burden of getting to know you, and so here I am.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry to hear that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You want to know where we\u8217\'92re going? We\u8217\'92re going to a place called Minting Rock. It\u8217\'92s off the road a few leagues north of here. And the road }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  here. You see its this hump here.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94 Moto traced the contour with an open hand. \u8220\'93They made it a hump so that water rolls off it. there\u8217\'92s even gutters on the sides if you dig down there. You see there between those hills, that little sump there? The slope that runs between them? Follow that all the way down -\u8220\'93\u8221\'94\line \tab \u8220\'93So you say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t believe me?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No, I believe you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto smiled. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It goes further than you\u8217\'92d think is possible. The Bazul Road. One of the charnel roads. You know what a charnel road is?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t suppose you can figure out why they call them charnel roads?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know what charnel means.\u8221\'94\line \tab \u8220\'93Means of place of death.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Then I guess it means things die on these roads.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 guess}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 ?\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s just a figure of speech.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You know the sun can kill you, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah. But-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93But what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Can\u8217\'92t people just walk the roads at night?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto raised his arms to the sun revelation, as if a long-awaited answer to a prayer had finally come. He smiled and shouted, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The boy thinks!\u8221\'94 A mocking gleam shone out from under his imposing brow, and he said Mandri, \u8220\'93I shall thank Sol that you are not well-and-truly dumb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, so I\u8217\'92m just regular-old-dumb then?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That remains to be seen. But what you undeniably are is ignorant.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It was an honest question.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It was! It is. But you see, it\u8217\'92s not any old thing that dies on a charnel road. It\u8217\'92s pilgrims that die. And as anyone who\u8217\'92s ever spent any time in the Sand knows, pilgrims don\u8217\'92t walk the roads at night because the whole point of walking the road is to suffer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I thought it was to get to where you\u8217\'92re going.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93See, you\u8217\'92ve never met a pilgrim.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pilgrims don\u8217\'92t go to Meskalem.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Ask a pilgrim why he doesn\u8217\'92t make the Bazul Road at night and he\u8217\'92ll tell you that if Bazul did not intend for him to suffer, then Bazul wouldn\u8217\'92t have been martyred out in the Sand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93If Bazul wanted a pilgrim to lead a life of comfort, then he\u8217\'92d have been killed on some oated knoll near calm waters. But oh, no! No, no, no! Bazul\u8217\'92s shrine is set deep into the Sand because Bazul deemed it fit to be killed there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Ah,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It was an indifferent \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91ah\u8217\'92. If Moto were a normal person, an utterance like that would get him to clam up. Not the well-adjusted. Mandri might as well have been a bush rustling its branches. Moto just kept on going.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Walking the road is a test of faith against the power of the sun, and to skip that test is the same as having no faith at all. So true Solitant pilgrims don\u8217\'92t trivialize the road by walking it at night. No, no. They trudge along the road in the blaze of day, and sometimes they die doing it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Tragic.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Not until recently, no.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You tell me. You guys are the ones who raised me from the dead.\u8221\'94}
