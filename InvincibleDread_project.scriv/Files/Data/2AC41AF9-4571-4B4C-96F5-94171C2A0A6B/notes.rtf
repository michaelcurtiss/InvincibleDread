\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri marched on.  Deliberate step after step, heel crushing dirt, then bursting a bloated hornscrub - that hurt but it didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t matter. Nothing mattered.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 This gets to the heart of the Solitant religion which believes that all creatures are naturally immortal, but they kill themselves with every bad decision. Every uncouth mistake ages the soul, every missed opportunity for righteousness draws another line in the face. If only people made the right decisions at every step they would live forever as a child, but we\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92re all too ignorant, too dumb, and too lazy. Sol\u8217\'92s light reveals the weight of our failures literally kills us. }}
