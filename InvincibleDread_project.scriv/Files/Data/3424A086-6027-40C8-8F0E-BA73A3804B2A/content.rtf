\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There were three people in Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s backpack. Two were dead, naught but a tangle of limbs stuffed down in the bottom, an unseemly sight with their elbows, shoulders, wrists, and hips bulging the leather. Elrahet was the other. Her head was poking out, ancient but very much alive. She glared out at the rest of the Ayramun who lagged behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hurry up!\u8221\'94 she barked. \u8220\'93This Riga boy won\u8217\'92t keep forever! Hurry it up!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pace was furious. The going was rough. At the start it was easy, a simple, flat and winding wagon path, then Ayram scrambled off to the left, up a near vertical scree, and Mandri had a hard time following. At the top was a shelf of sturdy rock, and this fed into a tall, narrow canyon, the opening of which was an inch wider than the width of Mandri\u8217\'92s shoulders. The canyon walls were striated with chalky shades of red and orange, and it\u8217\'92s dramatic sweeping forms towered overhead to buttress a thin, winding strip of bright blue sky. The sun played a game of peekaboo with Mandrameen as he went along, though sunlight never touched the mushy pile of sand and fallen rock that was the floor. Instead the light bounced around the warm walls and made the air seem to glow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This was not the same cursed rock that composed the Goree proper.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And Mandri might have savored the scene if he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t having such a hard time keeping up with the blistering pace. Almost at once he was confronted with a fork in the canyon path, and as the Ayramun had charged ahead without a spare care for him, he was left behind to wonder which way everyone had gone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His first instinct was to ask Obo. Obo would know.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His next instinct was to listen for the sounds of the Ayramun. Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grumbling. Seb\u8217\'92s sloshing spit. Bickering when. But faint echoes are a difficult thing to judge when the paths before him curved away in indeterminable directions.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The reliable thing to do was to look for Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s footprints. This was harder than it seemed because the sandy blend didn\u8217\'92t neatly preserve an impression. He managed because Ayram\u8217\'92s divots were unmistakably deeper than what was natural. Pleased with this little brilliance, Mandri marched on with some , but if he could figure it out, so too could any Hrkan trackers that were following behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soon, Mandri found himself marching under the oppressive eye of the sun as it crossed the thin arc of sky above. As the day progressed, the canyon air warmed up, and unlike the desert proper this air was not so dry as to lick the sweat right off his skin the moment it beaded up. He marched on and on, and the longer he marched, the soggier his shirt and brow became. Few feelings are more uncomfortable than that of a soggy lower back under a heavy leather pack. That vortex of steamy air that emerges between the two is like a weather system unto itself, and this self-sustaining convection current, shaped by the contours of muscle and spine, is a living thing, a parasite more annoying than any mosquito because it can\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be swatted away. And he wouldn\u8217\'92t be rid of it until he threw off his pack, ripped of his shirt, and ragged himself dry.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He eventually got his chance when the way belled out into a short and wide shadow-striped valley. It was a miniature valley of sorts, as it was only there because the canyon walls on either side had collapsed in the recent past. A mound of red rubble slouched in this valley\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly, though a thin, passable trail had been carved right through it. Above the precarious eastern slope was the Goree\u8217\'92s tallest plateau, stretching beyond vision, and above just that, the latter-day sun was casting shadows that stretched down to the floor. In them, the Ayramun were sitting, waiting for Mandrameen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah was the first to notice his coming.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There he is,\u8221\'94 she said, as if they\u8217\'92d been waiting for years.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I told you he was right behind,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is stretching the meaning of \u8216\'91right behind\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto stood up, stretched his back, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Time to go.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri pretended not to hear. If they had gotten a break, so would he.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If the Hrks have our trail, they won\u8217\'92t be far behind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet, still burrowed inside Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack, said, \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll give the boy a moment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri dumped that great weight off his shoulders, and it was like taking the lid off a steaming pot. The coolness that brushed his skin was glorious. He pulled off his tunic, and that, too, was glorious. He sat down a rock next to Purl, elbows on his knees, but sitting was not enough. He wanted to lay down, though with all the rubble, there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a good place for it. Then his eyes alighted on a veritable couch of a boulder, a smooth, sway-backed sandstone couch that he could melt onto. He stood up and made to climb up to it, and his first step up onto the eastern slope sent a trickle of sandstone crumbs tumbling down from above. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 What}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  are you doing?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m gonna lay down on that rock up there,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Stop.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to nap or anything. I\u8217\'92m gonna to lay down for a moment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He took another step up, and then Ayram blurted out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Heh! Down!\u8221\'94, as if he were giving commands to a dog.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri relented. That blessed rock was not that high up, maybe only twenty feet or so. He could climb up and jump down without a fuss, so why shouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t he be allowed to do it? Because he\u8217\'92d be left behind? Because Ayram said so? }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That usurped his good sense, and rebellion swelled up in his chest. He turned to the Ayram, who was snacking on a ribbon of jerky, half of which stuck-out of his mouth and  waved at Mandri with every munch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can I ask you something?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t wait for Ayram to finish chewing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you care what I do with myself?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s thick brows jumped up in amazement. He snapped off his jerky, shoved the rest into his cheek, then said, \u8220\'93You want to climb up there and have a rest?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93But look, I won\u8217\'92t do it if you don\u8217\'92t want me to\u8230\'85 it\u8217\'92s just that I never signed up for any of this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You didn\u8217\'92t?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not Ayramun... I mean, you\u8217\'92re a goddamned giant, so I\u8217\'92ll do what you want, but I\u8217\'92m not like, you know\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 The immense indifference of Ayram\u8217\'92s stare broke Mandri\u8217\'92s  indignation, made him lose his train of thought. Mandri shuffled around for the right words, and when he couldn\u8217\'92t find them, he circled back around to where he started. \u8220\'93I mean, why do you care what I do? If I take a short rest and fall behind, then I fall behind, so what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A disrespectful smile flashed out from under Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bushy beard and he snorted a laugh, the kind of laugh that could start a school-yard fight. And he wasn\u8217\'92t the only one looking at Mandri like he\u8217\'92d lost his mind. Moteah\u8217\'92s was especially imperious, looking at Mandri like he was one of those smelly old men who do nothing but wallow in gutter and extol the richness of poverty, the joys of sorrow, the virtues of vice, and annoy everyone with visions of the end of the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s so funny?\u8221\'94 said Mandri. He was careful to say it in Seb\u8217\'92s direction.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you blind?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl pointed up at the eastern slope. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then you must be dumb,\u8221\'94 she said, \u8220\'93because there\u8217\'92s a demon }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 right}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  there.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked and saw nothing but a bunch of red rocks and that sway-backed block of sandstone. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What, are you talking about?\u8221\'94, he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay, you }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 are}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  blind.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl bent down, picked up a rock, then side-armed it up the eastern slope.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri spun around in time to see the rock smack into a boulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The boulder flinched and flashed it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s yellow fangs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93OH, shit!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The thing was right there\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 right there\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 squatting plain as day above the stone on which Mandri planned to rest. It was a hairless, red, lizard skinned demon that blended in so neatly with the sandstone that as it settled back into its imperious, statuesque pose, Mandri lost sight of it, though only for a moment, for when Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind adjusted, the creature\u8217\'92s rock print pattern was betrayed by the organic forms of its corded muscle roping around its arms and legs, and these were human arms and legs, or rather, human-ish, for the proportions were all stretched out and it\u8217\'92s feet and hands were something else entirely. The feet were sharp-taloned and hawkish, and the fingers were curled and clawed like those of a long-lived pillow lizard. It\u8217\'92s face was a more compact admixture of the grotesque; the scrunched-up snout of a flat-faced pig, the nose and drooling flews of a hunting hound, and the outsized skull of a newborn babe,  scaled with lizardskin like everything else. Its eyes were yellow, snake-slitted, unblinking, and fixated on Mandrameen. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram did nothing but laugh. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was a tight-lipped smiler with a dominant lower-lip, and sometimes, as now, that bottom lip pushed the smile into the realm of confusion; half-smile, half-frown, half-what-is-wrong-with-you?.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not worth the effort\u8221\'94, said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But it\u8217\'92s a }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 demon,}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So? It\u8217\'92s not going sit there and let you kill it. It\u8217\'92s going to run away, and then you have to chase it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s mostly harmless,\u8221\'94 said Moteah. \u8220\'93Demons are flighty creatures. You\u8217\'92ll be fine as long as you don\u8217\'92t present yourself as meat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So you sayin\u8217\'92 he ain\u8217\'92t gonna be fine,\u8221\'94 Seb said t.}
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t believe what he was hearing. \u8220\'93What about those pilgrims on those poles?\u8221\'94 he asked. \u8220\'93That thing needs to be put down.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stood up, crossed his arms, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve got a sword. If you want it dead, go kill it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri eyed the demon again. The damned thing was still staring at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, uh\u8230\'85 I\u8217\'92m not confident in my demon slaying abilities.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That drew another turn of laughter. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Does that mean you\u8217\'92re ready to move along?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But it\u8217\'92s going to follow us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It won\u8217\'92t do anything,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. \u8220\'93That thing is as scared of me as you are of it. And it\u8217\'92s as dumb as a hammer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Purl hit it with a rock and it still thinks that we can\u8217\'92t see it. You have eye contact with the damned thing, and it\u8217\'92s still thinks that you are looking at rocks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram shook his head at the demon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stupidity. Then he reached down, grabbed an Ayram-sized throwing stone and rolled the odd shape around in his hand until he found a good grip. Then he fixed his gaze on the demon, and like whip he , and he zipped that rock straight at that demon\u8217\'92s mouth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 SMACK}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The rock exploded into fragments and dust.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The demon shrieked in surprise and then blood gargled pain as it tumbled back against the rocky slope. It tried to scramble upright, but Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stone had robbed it of it\u8217\'92s legs of confidence. It juddered and slipped and fell again. It\u8217\'92s face was such a bloody, broken mess, yet well-put-together considering the awful speed of Ayram\u8217\'92s stone. It didn\u8217\'92t take long for the demon to gather it\u8217\'92s bearings and scramble up the eastern slope on all fours, body low to the ground, leaping boulder to boulder. When it disappeared above the valley rim, Ayram bellowed out an exultant \u8220\'93Yih!\u8221\'94, and this sent another turn of chuckling through the Ayramun. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The violence put an energy into Ayram. Rejuvinated. A man who means what says, , loosened him to. He waved a grand arm towards the boulder of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s desire. \u8220\'93Looks like your rock is safe now,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93You can climb up there and lay down for as along as you like.\u8221\'94 He said it as if it were a dare.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll follow you,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Following me counts as signing up to be Ayramun. And being Ayramun means you do what I say. You understand?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, no backtalk\u8230\'85 And that goes for you too, Seb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb scoffed at this sudden turn, }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t backtalk, I give suggestions.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then no suggestions either! I swear, you got me halfway to breaking your jaw.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Ayram was confident that Seb had absorbed enough of his ire to fall in line, he turned again to Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So you understand me then?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, speak it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I understand. I\u8217\'92ll follow you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Good... But for now you\u8217\'92ll be following Moto.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto perked up and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you going to finish the demon off?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m going to scout for the Hrks,\u8221\'94 said Ayram. Then he added, smiling, \u8220\'93and if I happen to smash a demon\u8217\'92s skull on the way, then the world is better for it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where you want to meet up?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If it\u8217\'92s like the Mayzd predicted and there\u8217\'92s no one in Shulgi, then we\u8217\'92ll meet in Shulgi. The highest columned cave. Otherwise\u8230\'85 I don\u8217\'92t know\u8230\'85 I\u8217\'92ll find you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With that, he grabbed his spud bar and leapt up the eastern slope, jumping from rock to rock with a flowing, dexterous, grace that defied his giant frame.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His leaving left a silent void unbroken until Elrahet growled in disappointment. She\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have to walk.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She climbed out of the pack and stretched her legs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whose going to carry these two?\u8221\'94 She asked, kicking the bag of bodies.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto smiled at Mandri. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you going to be joining us?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then it\u8217\'92s time you pulled your weight.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto reached down into Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack and pulled out Obo\u8217\'92s pale and lifeless corpse by the neck. Then he grabbed Mandri\u8217\'92s litter and stuffed Obo into it as best he could. Then Moto began to fish for the Riga.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll carry Obo,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, \u8220\'93but I\u8217\'92m telling you, I }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 cannot}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  carry both of them. My back is already near breaking.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto froze, looked Mandri square in the eye and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ll do what I tell you to do.\u8221\'94 Moto\u8217\'92s avowed violence, clammed Mandri up, though it had the opposite effect on Moteah. She laughed, laughed bright and clear as if }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes darted to her and his brow furled in rage. \u8220\'93You got something to say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh come on,\u8221\'94 said Moteah. \u8220\'93Look at him. He\u8217\'92s a twig. He can\u8217\'92t carry all that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw went tight. He stood up straight, straight as so that his could reach that air of authority, and he pointed a finger at Mandrameen, \u8220\'93If he\u8217\'92s not gonna carry the Riga,\u8221\'94 the finger moved to Moteah,  \u8220\'93then }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  will carry the Riga.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah scoffed and settled into that incredulous hands-on-sidethrust-hip pose that drives angry men over the cliff, and not to be outskilled in art of finger-wagging, she pointed hers right back at Moto and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How about, for once, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 you }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 take up the weight of responsibility when Ayram gives it to you.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All the muscles in Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders tensed up, and like a frilled lizard unfurling it\u8217\'92s threat display, he rolled back in his hips and  about whether or not pummel her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb spat a wad of kackle? juice in between the siblings. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll carry it,\u8221\'94 he grumbled. \u8220\'93If\u8217\'92n it means you two stop barkin\u8217\'92 and we can get on with it, I\u8217\'92ll carry the damned thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no room in your pack,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93For Sol\u8217\'92s sake, lash it to my pack then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb unshouldered his pack and dropped it at Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet. Moto, unhappy with Seb\u8217\'92s act of charity, kept his grudging eyes fixed on his sister as he pulled the Riga child up out of Ayram\u8217\'92s pack. A few wraps and knots of vinecord later, and the dead Riga was fixed in a harness to Seb\u8217\'92s pack. The Riga was completely, still swaddled in black, was unsettling sight when Seb walked, for the child\u8217\'92s head lolled from side to side as if it were merely asleep.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb bore his heavy pack with the stolidity of an ox, and he charged ahead into the canyon beyond, though his springy kick-step was reduced to hurried shuffle under the weight. Elrahet followed after him, and then Purl after her, and then Moteah brushed by her brother bearing a look of utter distaste. That left Mandri alone to with to deal with Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shortened fuse. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Stuffed as Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack was, both of Obo\u8217\'92s forearms couldn\u8217\'92t fit, and with the drawstring tight around them, they stuck straight up into the air like a white rabbit\u8217\'92s ears. When Mandri got the pack settled on his shoulders, Obo\u8217\'92s limp-wristed hands flopped against the back of his head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto stopped him from fixing the issue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Walk,\u8221\'94 he said, and Mandri walked.  }
