\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram led them up into the mountain\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow. He paused before passing into the Mandri knew they were in the pass proper when they passed into a split in the rock that was barely wider than the width of his shoulders.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a squeezing, striated canyon, and in places the rock overhead hand been scuplted by the ages into and flanges. Here and there the sun could be seen, peeking through the split overhead, though its light never reached the sandy floor directly, instead it bounced around and absorbed the redness of the sandstone and set the rolling earth aglow. Now and then the canyon walls belled out and Mandri could see the slopes of the tallest plateaus stretching up beyond vision, but most of these hours were spent with naught but a narrow, sinuous stripe of blue sky above, squeezed by the red shadow of the stone. }

\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Around the bend, the canyon emptied out into a wider, sun-drenched valley, though this stretch was almost too short to be called a valley. Both sides of the canyon here had collapsed, and resultant pile of rock had been cleared out, resulting in a clean, sandy trail splitting two steep slopes of precariously balanced rubble.}

\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind was made up to defer towards Elrahet. Still, Moteah and Seb bickered, and while they were arguing, a whispered came from Obo into Mandri\u8217\'92s ear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Stop walking,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just stop.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stopped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Still whispering, Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look up. There on the slope to your left, do you see anything?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked at the southern slope and saw nothing but brittle stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whisper came again, \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s two clefts, there\u8217\'92s a creature hiding up there on the first one, behind a boulder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The southern slope, while , was stratified into three layers separated by two flat clefts of mostly unbroken sandstone. The first cleft was not that high up, maybe twenty feet or so, and on it stood many boulders, though Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s took notice of a flattish triangular rock that stood up and swayed back like a shark\u8217\'92s-tooth. Poking out from behind that rock, like a weed, was a goat\u8217\'92s horn. Mandri didn\u8217\'92t take it to be a horn at first, because there was only one and it curved downwards instead of up. He thought it was a withered branch of a some out-of-sight stump, but then the thing moved, floating into view was a dark, savage face, vaguely human in appearance, with a deep-set, shadowed brow and sunken cheeks, a face which protruded out more than faces usually do, which combined with a flat nose, gave the impression of a snout.}

Its yellow teeth flashed, and Mandri shrieked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stumbled backwards and pointed up at creature as it ducked back behind its rock. Mandri looked around to see if anyone else had noticed it, but everyone was looking at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Up there!\u8221\'94 He shouted, \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a creature!\u8221\'94}
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone looked up at the southern slopes, but they saw nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What you on about?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri shuffled backwards to try and find a sight-line that might reveal around that shark\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92stooth boulder, but try as he might, he could see nothing. Whatever had been there was gone. What remained was the dismissive looks of Seb and Moteah, and the }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There was a creature there, just now,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s lizards all over,\u8221\'94 Seb said dismissively.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It wasn\u8217\'92t a lizard. It was a\u8230\'85 a\u8230\'85\u8221\'94. Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t finish the sentence because he didn\u8217\'92t know what it was that he\u8217\'92d seen. He could paint it\u8217\'92s spitting image if asked, but a head and a horn does not make. It wasn\u8217\'92t human, that much he knew, but it wasn\u8217\'92t anything else.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram pushed his way back through through group, and he leered down at Mandrameen as he gave his beard a serious tug.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What was it you saw?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t ask what you thought you saw, what did you }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 see}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 .\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri floundered around for a word that could. The pressure of Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s glare pushed out a . \u8220\'93I saw a\u8230\'85 a face\u8230\'85 a face, a beast\u8217\'92s face with a horn sticking out like this\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Mandri traced the shape of a horn growing out of his forehead, sticking out at an odd angle and curling slightly down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram gave his beard a four-fingered flourish as he gazed up at the rocky slope. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo saw it too,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93Tell them, Obo.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s questing eye glanced back down at Mandri}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But Obo had by now fully retreated back into his litter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know what it was. It had a distinctive smell. Unfamiliar. A rare breed of goat, perhaps.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was no goat,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93It was a human face.\u8221\'94}
