\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moteah, stop.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Purl, be quiet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why pretend like you want to deal with us? What\u8217\'92s in it for you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I . We Mazydai are practical creatures. We want what\u8217\'92s fair. I do something for you, you do something for me. What you do for me is, naturally, dependent on what I do for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Answer the goddamn question.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My point is that, whatever purpose you have for capturing me like this, I\u8217\'92ll willingly carry out the task, whatever it is, provided you do a favor in return. So, tell me why I\u8217\'92m here and I\u8217\'92ll tell you what I want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re here because-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moteah. Stop.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What? It doesn\u8217\'92t matter if he knows. He\u8217\'92s going to know eventually anyways.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Quiets Purl down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We captured you to kill Solraheen.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I must admit, my initial reaction was t, but I can tell you are serious. Perhaps you all know something that I do not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think it can\u8217\'92t be done?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have no idea.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I take it your plan was to, somehow, smuggle me down into Halfheart temple, and then have me blast Solraheen\u8217\'92s skull wide open with my voice?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the idea.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why? Solraheen is just a figurehead these days. They keep him so drugged up on havi fumes that he can\u8217\'92t even talk. Killing him trigger a little chaos for a while, maybe even a few years, but it won\u8217\'92t do a thing to change the calculus of power in Jandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If that is how you feel about killing a god, then I\u8217\'92m sure you won\u8217\'92t mind doing it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve always been curious to know what would happen if my torch-voice touched godflesh. Though, there\u8217\'92s the issue of my fee.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not in charge, so I can\u8217\'92t promise you anything. I\u8217\'92m sure you\u8217\'92ll be paid well enough.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not interested in material things. I am a Mazydai. I am Sparkless. I require a Spark.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I watched your witch Elrahet put a Spark in this dead boy\u8217\'92s body. She brought him back to life. I did not believe such a thing was possible, yet I saw it with my own two eyes. I she could infuse inanimate matter with a Spark, then perhaps she could do the same for me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mazydai are slaves, Purl. I know you hate us, . But everything we do, }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Those are my terms, take it or leave. Given the magnitude of the task, that is all I will accept in exchange.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Use your brain you little shit. If he is some dark prophesy, then even if we kill him, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ll just come back. Doesn\u8217\'92t matter what we do. If he\u8217\'92s not, then we\u8217\'92ll have killed hapless young man in his prime.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 How? There\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s seventy against twenty.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yes, but the Hrkan soldiers stationed in Scota aren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quality. Very little of the training those men have received will prepare them to what they\u8217\'92re facing. I\u8217\'92d expect the relative skill, Ayramun to Hrkan conscript, is likely 3 to one. What tips the balance in the Ayramun\u8217\'92s favor is Minting Rock\u8217\'92s defenses. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What defenses?}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ah, but you don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know what a Shade can do. It would be interesting to see how Ayram deals with it.}

Love isnt a distinctly human emotion. Humans are the only ones who trick themselves into thinking its something more than what it is. Open with love. Physical attraction.
