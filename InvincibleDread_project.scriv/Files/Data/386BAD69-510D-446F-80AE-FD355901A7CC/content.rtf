\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The rule-following paradox threatens our ordinary beliefs and practices concerning meaning because it implies that there is no such thing as meaning something by an expression or sentence.\~}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McDowell"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0\i0 John McDowell}}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \~explains this as follows. We are inclined to think of meaning in contractual terms: that is, that meanings commit or oblige us to use words in a certain way. When you grasp the meaning of the word "dog", for example, you know that you ought to use that word to refer to dogs, and not cats. But if there cannot be rules governing the uses of words, as the rule-following paradox apparently shows, this intuitive notion of meaning is utterly undermined. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Kripke's skeptical solution is this: A language-user's following a rule correctly is not justified by any fact that obtains about the relationship between their candidate application of a rule in a particular case and the putative rule itself (as for Hume the causal link between two events\~}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 a}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \~and\~}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 b}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \~is not determined by any particular fact obtaining between them\~}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 taken in isolation}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 ); rather, the assertion that the rule that is being followed is justified by the fact that the behaviors surrounding the candidate instance of rule-following (by the candidate rule-follower) meet other language users' expectations.
