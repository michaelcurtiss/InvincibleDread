\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The self-immolation was thoroughly prepared \endash  under the supervision of one of the Old Believer tutors (they didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have priests), a \u8220\'93burn house\u8221\'94 was built \endash  a vast wooden structure that would contain the self-immolators. For example, a \u8216\'91burn house\u8217\'92 built in the Arkhangelsk region for the 1685 self-immolation contained 230 bodies. It wasn\u8217\'92t usually a single-room house, more like several wooden cabins joined together, often in two or more storeys. Typical \u8216\'91burn houses\u8217\'92 were meant for several dozen people.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The house was then filled with hay, candle tow, and other flammable materials, including often a barrel or two of gunpowder. The windows and the door were ready to be sealed from the outside by other Old Believers who were to aide the self-immolators. As soon as the Old Believers learned about any military formation heading their way, they locked themselves inside the building and waited for the soldiers to come, then self-immolated}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before self-immolation, all Old Believers and their children were symbolically christened again, because they were to face \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91baptism with fire\u8217\'92. Many of them took monastic vows. But not all of them were so brave to withstand the fire. Inside the \u8216\'91burn house\u8217\'92, certain trusted people (that were to burn with the others, too) were armed with rifles and axes to murder those who tried to escape \endash  one should accept the \u8216\'91fire baptism\u8217\'92 with humility, because it was a door to eternal life in the Kingdom of God, the Old Believers preached. Anyway, death for those poor Old Believers came pretty soon, not from burns, but carbon monoxide poisoning. }
