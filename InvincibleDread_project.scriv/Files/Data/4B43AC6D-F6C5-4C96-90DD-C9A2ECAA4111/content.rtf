\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tundra is the most poleward and highest elevation biome and is characterized by extremely cold winters. Dominat plant life forms are ground hugging woody shrubs and perennial herbs. Intesne cold excludes trees. No plant can survive if exposed above the winter snow cover. And succulents - the growing season is too short for annuals. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Semiarid biome that occurs on the west coast of every continent between 30 and for latitude. Smallest biome unique for mediterannean climate: mild, moist winters and hot, dry summers. Called chaparral in North America. Mature chaparral consists almost solely of woody, evergreen shrubs with small, leathery leaves. The numerous species form impenetrable thickets from 5 to 8 feet tall.  }{\f1\fs24\b1\i0 During the long, dry summers the typically resinous foliage and dry, woody stems become explosively combustible. Wildfires raze large areas to ash-covered earth every few decades. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Species are well adapted to periodic blazes. Following fires the bare ground is briefly colonized by a large number of annual species, but the land is soon reclaimed by the shrubs that sprout from seeds or root crowns.  }{\f1\fs24\b1\i0 Trees and succulents are rare life forms in chaparral because they are more vulnerable to destruction by the very hot fires.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Not biomes, though they could be considered isolated ribbons of temperate broadleaf forest they are better viewed as a unique habitat type. Occur within any biome wherever there is perennial water near the surface. The term }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 riparian}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  specifically refers to the zones along the banks of rivers; hower it is also applied to the shoreline communites of slow or nonflowing waters such as marshes and lake. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The drier the surrounding habitat, the more distinct is the riparian zone. In the desert grassland, a flowing stream supports a consipcuous oasis with forests and wildlife that would not otherwise occur in the area. The available water also augments populations of more arid-adapted species. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Montane streams support alders and aspens, while lower elevations there are cottonwoods and sycamores.}

There are two consequences. A 1-square meter beam of sunlight shines on about 1 square meter of the earth\u8217\'92s surface at the quator at noon, but it covers more than twice that area near the poles. The sun\u8217\'92s light and heat are thus less concentrated at higher latitudes. In addition, the quator the sunlight travels straight down through the atmosphere, but near the poles it travels through much more aire. Where more light is reflected, absorbed, or scattered and less reaches the ground. This is why the equator is hot and the poles are cold.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Equatorial region both hot and wet - it is a zone of warm, rising air. Absorbs much water vapor from the oceans and land vegetation. As this rises it cools. Eventually it reaches saturation , and vwater vapor conenses into clouds and often falls as rain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The equatorial air rises, then spreads horizontally at high elevations to the north and south. Eventually the now-cool air sinks and flows along the surface to replace the rising air at the equator, forming a circulation cell. It tends to sink at about 30 north and 30 south latitude. Two zones called the horse latitudes by mariners. Sailing vessels were becalmed in these lattitudes. As the air sinks it becomes warm with compression, and becaus there is no source of evaporating water, it becomes drier with increasing temperature. Not only can sinking air not produce rain, but when it reache the ground it absorbs water from teh soil and vegetation, creating even more arid condition. }

Monsoon is derived from an arabic word for \u8216\'91season\u8217\'92, was applied to a wind that changes direction seasonally.
