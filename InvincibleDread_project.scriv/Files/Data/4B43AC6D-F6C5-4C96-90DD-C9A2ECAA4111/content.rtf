\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Semiarid biome that occurs on the west coast of every continent between 30 and for latitude. Smallest biome unique for mediterannean climate: mild, moist winters and hot, dry summers. Called chaparral in North America. Mature chaparral consists almost solely of woody, evergreen shrubs with small, leathery leaves. The numerous species form impenetrable thickets from 5 to 8 feet tall.  }{\f2\fs24\b1\i0 During the long, dry summers the typically resinous foliage and dry, woody stems become explosively combustible. Wildfires raze large areas to ash-covered earth every few decades. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  Species are well adapted to periodic blazes. Following fires the bare ground is briefly colonized by a large number of annual species, but the land is soon reclaimed by the shrubs that sprout from seeds or root crowns.  }{\f2\fs24\b1\i0 Trees and succulents are rare life forms in chaparral because they are more vulnerable to destruction by the very hot fires.

Occur within any biome wherever there is perennial water near the surface. The term }{\f3\fs24\b0\i1 riparian}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  specifically refers to the zones along the banks of rivers; hower it is also applied to the shoreline communites of slow or nonflowing waters such as marshes and lake. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The drier the surrounding habitat, the more distinct is the riparian zone. In the desert grassland, a flowing stream supports a consipcuous oasis with forests and wildlife that would not otherwise occur in the area.

There are two consequences. A 1-square meter beam of sunlight shines on about 1 square meter of the earth\u8217\'92s surface at the quator at noon, but it covers more than twice that area near the poles. The sun\u8217\'92s light and heat are thus less concentrated at higher latitudes.

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The equatorial air rises, then spreads horizontally at high elevations to the north and south. Eventually the now-cool air sinks and flows along the surface to replace the rising air at the equator, forming a circulation cell. It tends to sink at about 30 north and 30 south latitude. Two zones called the horse latitudes by mariners. Sailing vessels were becalmed in these lattitudes. As the air sinks it becomes warm with compression, and becaus there is no source of evaporating water, it becomes drier with increasing temperature. Not only can sinking air not produce rain, but when it reache the ground it absorbs water from teh soil and vegetation, creating even more arid condition. }

The evaporative loss form a kangaroo rat is low, as the animal has no sweat glands and little water is passively lost through its skin.
