Theyre close enough that if you wander in any direction, they\u8217\'92ll find you. If you want to survive, you\u8217\'92ve got to disappear. We are far past the point of treating - you\u8217\'92ve done damage to a myth - so you can\u8217\'92t be  allowed to live to talk about it. So, to do that,  you have to part with me. So you can kill me, or leave me behind.}
