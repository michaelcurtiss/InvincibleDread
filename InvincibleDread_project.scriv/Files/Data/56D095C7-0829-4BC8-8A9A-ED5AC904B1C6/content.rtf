She tells of an ancient prophecy, and she believes Mandrameen may play a part\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 then she sprouts fangs! She slaughters Mandrameen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ox!

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She chases Mandrameen out of his wits and he winds up dead in the desert. His body is found by a band of no-ordinary bandits, for among them is a (different) witch who brings Mandrameen back to life. These bandits are led by the manliest of all possible men, Ayram, and they call themselves the Ayramun. These Ayramun have also captured a Mazid\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a fleshcrafted being of great power and intelligence. Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s goal, he says, is to use the Mazid to strike a blow at the oppressive Hrkan Lords by venturing into the caverns underneath the Hrkan capital and killing the god of all creation.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But all is not as it seems, for traitorous knives lurk in the dark, and the Sand is rife with cannibalistic theologies and dark cosmologies, while demons are hiding in the ground. Mandri struggles along with the Ayramun, unsure of himself, unsure of everyone else, unsure of the very nature of reality. The only thing he is sure of is that he kind of wants to die.}
