\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I am not religious in that I am not a member of any religion that anybody has ever heard of. However, I am a religious creature. I use the term \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91religious creature\u8217\'92 instead of \u8216\'91spiritual creature\u8217\'92, because \u8216\'91spiritual\u8217\'92 carries the connotation that I do not account for doctrine\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 I do have doctrine. It happens to be doctrine that I have created myself, so I sypathize with anyone who accuses me of being merely spiritual, but every religion starts with the invention of doctrine - it has to start somewhere.}
