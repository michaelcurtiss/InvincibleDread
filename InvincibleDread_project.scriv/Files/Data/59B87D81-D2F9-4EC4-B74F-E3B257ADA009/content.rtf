\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Parataxis}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \tab - tell me, how are you?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The underlying idea is that in a connected discourse, complete independence among the consecutive sentences is very rare. This observation is captured in the expression "train of thought".[5] Consider the following:}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The sun was shining brightly. We went for a walk.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The sun was shining brightly; we went for a walk.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The sun was shining brightly, and we went for a walk.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The sun was shining brightly, so we went for a walk.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 In the first example, the two sentences are independent expressions, while in the last example they are dependent. However, the connection of thought in the first examples is just as real as in the last ones, where it is explicitly expressed via the syntax of subordination.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 In spoken language, this continuance from sentence to sentence is supported by intonation and timing (rhythm, pause). While details may differ among different languages and cultures, generally similar musicality and shortness of pauses indicate the continuation, while the change of tone and longer pause generally indicate the transition to another connected group of ideas.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 In storytelling, storytellers utilize paratactic or syntactic styles. Parataxis is common among oral storytellers. When telling a story orally, there are many inconsistencies because of the lack of a written-down, word-for-word, multiply-checked draft. However, audiences do not set out to compare the stories word for word and are only interested in the main points of the story.[7]}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Parataxis roughly translates to "arranging side by side", while hypotaxis translates to "arranging under". Parataxis omits subordinating conjunctions while hypotaxis utilizes them such as the terms "when", "although", and "after". Parataxis juxtaposes ideas and thoughts, while hypotaxis subordinates ideas to one another and can show both juxtaposition and transition. Because of this, hypotaxis can show relationships of cause and effect, chronology, and comparison }
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Hypotaxis is the grammatical arrangement of functionally similar but "unequal" constructs (from Greek hypo- "beneath", and taxis "arrangement"); certain constructs have more importance than others inside a sentence.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 A common example of syntactic expression of hypotaxis is the subordination of one syntactic unit to another in a complex sentence.[1] Another example is observed in premodification. In the phrase "inexpensive composite materials", "composite" modifies "materials" while "inexpensive" modifies the complex head "composite materials", rather than "composite" or "materials". In this example the phrase units are hierarchically structured, rather than being on the same level, as compared to the example "Cockroaches love warm, damp, dark places." Note the syntactic difference; hypotactic modifiers cannot be separated by a comma.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Anagnorisis (/\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u716\'3F\u230\'E6n\u601\'3F\u609\'67\u712\'27n\u594\'3Fr\u618\'3Fs\u618\'3Fs/; Ancient Greek: \u7936\'3F\u957\'3F\u945\'61\u947\'3F\u957\'3F\u974\'3F\u961\'3F\u953\'3F\u963\'73\u953\'3F\u962\'3F) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery. Anagnorisis originally meant recognition in its Greek context, not only of a person but also of what that person stood for. Anagnorisis was the hero's sudden awareness of a real situation, the realisation of things as they stood, and finally, the hero's insight into a relationship with an often antagonistic character in Aristotelian tragedy. }

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The earliest use of anagnorisis in a murder mystery was in "The Three Apples", a classical Arabian Nights tale, where the device is employed to great effect in its twist ending.[4] The protagonist of the story, Ja'far ibn Yahya, is ordered by Harun al-Rashid to find the culprit behind a murder mystery within three days or else be executed. It is only after the deadline has passed, and as he prepares to be executed, that he discovers that the culprit was his own slave all along }

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Amplification refers to a literary practice wherein the writer embellishes the sentence by adding more information to it in order to increase its worth and understanding.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 E.g., Original sentence: The thesis paper was difficult. After amplification: The thesis paper was difficult: it required extensive research, data collection, sample surveys, interviews and a lot of fieldwork.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 When sentences do not use conjunctions (e.g., and, or, nor) to separate clauses, but run clauses into one another, usually marking the separation of clauses with punctuation.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 An example is when John F. Kennedy said on January 20, 1961 "...that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty."}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Representing an object or character with abundant descriptive detail, or mimetically rendering gestures and dialogue to make a scene more visual or imaginatively present to an audience.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 This technique appears at least as far back as the Arabian Nights.[11]}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Word or phrase in a figure of speech in which a noun is referenced by something closely associated with it, rather than explicitly by the noun itself. This is not to be confused with synecdoche, in which a part of the whole stands for the thing itself.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 An example of this is in the first chapter of Great Expectations by Charles Dickens: "A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin"}
