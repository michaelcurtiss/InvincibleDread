\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The fundamental method of adaptation in any system is the revision and recombination of its building blocks. It is crucial for the system to have accurate information about its environment. Otherwise the system reverts to Nature to prune inefficiencies, and this is a terribly inefficient process.}

These bodies were also known, with ominous accuracy, as les e\u8217\'92corcheurs ( scorchers). Nor did activities of free-ranging knights always measure up to the high standards o the medieval romances. Saint Peter Damian ( a bishop of Ostia in the eleventh century), for example, grumbled that the swords wielded by knights errant had created more widows and orphans than they had protected. By the end of the sixteenth century, knighthood had sunk to the leel of satire at the hands of miguel de cervantes.}

Never, in short, has writing about war been so largely the province of people so far removed from the actual practice of the subject.}
