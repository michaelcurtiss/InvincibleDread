Pyetle runs up into the hills. Sees the terrain. Starts to put it together - this is a sacrifice. Ayram charges in on his steed into the thick of the fight, and 'explodes'.
every being in massive radius dies - save Mazyd (who is flayed and in agony) and the other Seilsi.
That seilsi and Ayram do battle for the ages. Pyetle creeps up to Mazyd to put him out of his misery. Mazyd gives instruction to help defeat Ayram. It appears Ayram is vanquished - or is he?
