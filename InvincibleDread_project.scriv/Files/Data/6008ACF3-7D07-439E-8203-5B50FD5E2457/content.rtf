\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gugi - why him?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pell - get over yourself. You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re a simpleton. The divine plan which the world. YOU????}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When the gods created man he let death be his lot, eternal life. SHould have bed a wench and snotlings and then you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be set.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first leg of the journey was an easy hike to a clump of hills set in the hazy north. Those hills, Mandri was told, were called the Spithawk hills, and at a pilgrim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pace it\u8217\'92d be a whole day\u8217\'92s journey from Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Ayramun didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t march at a pilgrim\u8217\'92s pace. They kicked up dust because they had to keep up with Ayram\u8217\'92s rangy stride.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One person outpaced Ayram: Seb. Seb had evidently never heard that quip about life being about the journey, because he charged ahead with the grim determination of a man who wanted it all over with as soon as possible. He did not talk, he did not look up from the spot of ground a few feet in front him, and when everyone else took pause to water, he did not stop. It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t take long for Seb to be out a few miles ahead, and he never once looked back, and nobody else yelled out after him to wait.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Behind him, far behind him, marched Ayram, and then Moto. Behind them, close behind, was Mandri. Mandri spent the hours trying to listen in on Ayram and Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s conversation. He couldn\u8217\'92t catch their words cleanly, but he could gather the gist of them from Moto\u8217\'92s excited expressions. The man clearly had his own ideas about how to best capture another Mazydariga, and he\u8217\'92d engaged his hands and shoulders into the effort of convincing Ayram the truth of it. To be sure, he kept a respectful tone, but it seemed to Mandri that all the moving parts had Ayram flummoxed. The giant rarely did more than grunt. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah and Purl picked up the rear. They made sure that Elrahet didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t lag behind. Whenever Mandri looked behind to see how they were getting on, Elrahet didn\u8217\'92t look at all like she needed their help. She had set off from Minting Rock at a steady pace and as far as Mandri could tell, she never wavered. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She has desert legs\u8221\'94, is what Moto said when Mandri asked about it. Mandri didn\u8217\'92t know what \u8216\'91desert legs\u8217\'92 meant until that evening, after they\u8217\'92d crossed a good chunk of the distance and the red clay gave way to a softer pink sand. That sand gave the surface a little give, and that set his calves to burning, and that burn ramped up quickly. Mandri wanted to stop and rub it out, but he didn\u8217\'92t dare for fear of being outpaced by an old woman. Every time he glanced behind him, sure enough, she was there, a waddling bundle of rags. Mandri wondered if that wide-stepped waddle was easier on the legs, but he didn\u8217\'92t do it, because nobody else was. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The pain was worse in the right leg because Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s poultice was still working its magic into his left, making it halfway numb. He could bear it, though. His legs would be sore come the morrow, but he could bear it. What he couldn\u8217\'92t bear was the weight of Mazyd Obo. The straps holding up Obo\u8217\'92s litter dug into his shoulders. He didn\u8217\'92t really have shoulders, just a thin, lean of muscle atop the collarbone, so the straps bit down and it felt like they were bruising the bone. He kept trying to shift the straps around, to try to distribute the pain, but after a while, every spot was tender. The only way he could find relief was to dig his fingers up under the straps, and let them take the burden.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He grimaced. He hissed. He.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not so bad,\u8221\'94 Obo said.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Only two-hundred thousand steps to go.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said two-hundred thousand steps to go.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How many have I done already?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93From Minting Rock, it\u8217\'92s been 19,358, exactly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a farmer, you\u8217\'92d have a wiry strength, but look at you.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yeah, well\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85 it is what it is.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hah! It is, isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t it? You want a borcandi spine?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s that? }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Digs one out of a pocket.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You chew \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91em. Cleans the soreness right out.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Starts chewing. Squelching.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I could go for a burgeon beer right now.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re a burgeon man?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Burgeons are the only thing that make life worthwhile. Smiling, but entirely serious.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Wha-ho! You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re in luck, then Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Digging around.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at what I\u8217\'92ve got here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sight of the burgeons. Mouth watering.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What are those?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Call it god\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What do I got to do to get you to share?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Smiles. Come \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91ere.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Follows Seb deeper into the cave.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are we going down here for? I\u8217\'92m not going to suckle your or anything.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb stopped. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have a perverted mind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was just a joke.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mhmm\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re headed down to get away from Ayram. He don\u8217\'92t much like burgeons. Liable to slit our throats if he gets a whiff.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Follows him down to a clearing}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Not too dissimilar to the one he woke up in after he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been killed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve been down here before?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Aye.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sits. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb brushes the ash from his beard gristle and cheese}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Now, how do you like your burgeons?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Any way I can get them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Look at Mandri is like, this guy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re just like that Mazyd; can never answer a question straight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I just don\u8217\'92t have a specific preference. I\u8217\'92ll take them crushed, boiled, stewed, crumbled in eggs, dripped over bacon, pressed into beer\u8230\'85 I\u8217\'92ve even boiled them up into a burgeon tea and the boofed it. Actually, that\u8217\'92s probably the best way to do it. Wouldn\u8217\'92t call it my preference, but it is more efficient that way, like if you want to just crack open the head, you\u8217\'92d only need a quarter of what you\u8217\'92ve got if you boof it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are disgusting.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why is that disgusting? It\u8217\'92s the way we were made. Solraheen didn\u8217\'92t put a second mouth inside our butts without a reason, you ever think of it like that? I mean, if I were designing human beings, I wouldn\u8217\'92t mix up the piping like that, but it is what it is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Begrudging acceptance on behalf of Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s still disgusting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But it is efficient.  We\u8217\'92re still nine days from Ullr, and how long are those burgeons going to last us? \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Us?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, okay, fine, how long will they last you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is God\u8217\'92s Eye. It doesn\u8217\'92t take much to crack open your head. Half a sliver will do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Cuts it. Juices like dew drops. Sweating.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hands it over to mandri, mandri swallows it, then licks the dew.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You aren\u8217\'92t having any?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I will wait. Sometimes, people have a bad reaction.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll be fine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Believe me. I bet I\u8217\'92ve consumed more burgeons than any man alive.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If that were true then you\u8217\'92d know that not all burgeons are the same. Sit back and watch the fire. We\u8217\'92ll know soon enough how you\u8217\'92re handling it.\u8221\'94}
