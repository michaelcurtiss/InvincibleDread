\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gugi - why him?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pell - get over yourself. You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re a simpleton. The divine plan which the world. YOU????}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When the gods created man he let death be his lot, eternal life. SHould have bed a wench and snotlings and then you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be set.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first leg of the journey was an easy hike to a clump of hills set in the hazy north. Those hills, Mandri was told, were called the Sand hills, and at a pilgrim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pace it\u8217\'92d be a whole day\u8217\'92s journey from Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Ayramun didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t march at a pilgrim\u8217\'92s pace. They kicked up dust because they had to keep up with Ayram\u8217\'92s rangy stride.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One person outpaced Ayram: Seb. Seb had evidently never heard that quip about life being about the journey, because he charged ahead with the grim determination of a man who wanted it all over with as soon as possible. He did not talk, he did not look up from the spot of ground a few feet in front him, and when everyone else took pause to water, he did not stop. It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t take long for Seb to be out a few miles ahead, and he never once looked back, and nobody else yelled out after him to wait.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Behind him, far behind him, marched Ayram, and then Moto. Behind them, close behind, was Mandri. Mandri spent the hours trying to listen in on Ayram and Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s conversation. He couldn\u8217\'92t catch their words cleanly, but he could gather the gist of them from Moto\u8217\'92s excited expressions. The man clearly had his own ideas about how to best capture another Mazydariga, and he\u8217\'92d engaged his hands and shoulders into the effort of convincing Ayram the truth of it. To be sure, he kept a respectful tone, but it seemed to Mandri that all the moving parts had Ayram flummoxed. The giant rarely did more than grunt. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah and Purl picked up the rear. They made sure that Elrahet didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t lag behind. Whenever Mandri looked behind to see how they were getting on, Elrahet didn\u8217\'92t look at all like she needed their help. She had set off from Minting Rock at a steady pace and as far as Mandri could tell, she never wavered. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She has desert legs\u8221\'94, is what Moto said when Mandri asked about it. Mandri didn\u8217\'92t know what \u8216\'91desert legs\u8217\'92 meant until that evening, after they\u8217\'92d crossed a good chunk of the distance and the red clay gave way to a softer pink sand. That sand gave the surface a little give, and that set his calves to burning, and that burn ramped up quickly. Mandri wanted to stop and rub it out, but he didn\u8217\'92t dare for fear of being outpaced by an old woman. Every time he glanced behind him, sure enough, she was there, a waddling bundle of rags. Mandri wondered if that wide-stepped waddle was easier on the legs, but he didn\u8217\'92t do it, because nobody else was. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The pain was worse in the right leg because Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s poultice was still working its magic into his left, making it halfway numb. He could bear it, though. His legs would be sore come the morrow, but he could bear it. What he couldn\u8217\'92t bear was the weight of Mazyd Obo. The straps holding up Obo\u8217\'92s litter dug into his shoulders. He didn\u8217\'92t really have shoulders, just a thin, lean of muscle atop the collarbone, so the straps bit down and it felt like they were bruising the bone. He kept trying to shift the straps around, to try to distribute the pain, but after a while, every spot was tender. The only way he could find relief was to dig his fingers up under the straps, and let them take the burden.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He grimaced. He hissed. He.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not so bad,\u8221\'94 Obo said.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Come to the hills, and the weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t Sand hills, which were more dunes than hills, though there was enough hardscrabble pebbles and rocks in them to call them hills. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Burgeons are the only thing that make life worthwhile. Smiling, but entirely serious.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Wha-ho! You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re in luck, then Mandri.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb stopped. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have a perverted mind.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Follows him down to a clearing}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Not too dissimilar to the one he woke up in after he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been killed. Little fire. Soot on the dark ceiling. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Any way I can get them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Look at Mandri is like, this guy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re just like that Mazyd; can never answer a question straight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I just don\u8217\'92t have a specific preference. I\u8217\'92ll take them crushed, boiled, stewed, crumbled in eggs, dripped over bacon, pressed into beer\u8230\'85 I\u8217\'92ve even boiled them up into a burgeon tea and the boofed it. Actually, that\u8217\'92s probably the best way to do it. Wouldn\u8217\'92t call it my preference, but it is more efficient that way, like if you want to just crack open the head, you\u8217\'92d only need a quarter of what you\u8217\'92ve got if you boof it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are disgusting.\u8221\'94}

Solraheen didn\u8217\'92t put a second mouth inside our butts without a reason, you ever think of it like that? I mean, if I were designing human beings, I wouldn\u8217\'92t mix up the piping like that, but it is what it is.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s still disgusting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But it is efficient.  We\u8217\'92re still nine days from Ullr, and how long are those burgeons going to last us? \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Us?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, okay, fine, how long will they last you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is God\u8217\'92s Eye. It doesn\u8217\'92t take much to crack open your head. Half a sliver will do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Cuts it. Juices like dew drops. Sweating.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hands it over to mandri, mandri swallows it, then licks the dew.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You aren\u8217\'92t having any?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I will wait. Sometimes, people have a bad reaction.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll be fine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I bet I\u8217\'92ve consumed more burgeons than any man alive.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If that were true, then you\u8217\'92d know that not all burgeons are the same. Just sit back and watch the fire. We\u8217\'92ll know soon enough how you handle it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stared at the fire and waited for the burgeons to morph his senses. God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eye burgeons, should give him a god\u8217\'92s sight. Or were they called that because they simply looked like eyes? Mandri kept staring at the small fire which was jumping, and he wondered how long it would take for it to begin. Burgeon time was variable. And that\u8217\'92s the thing about  burgeons, they\u8217\'92re all about timing. Starts with the harvest. Got to do it at the right time, a burgeon bush doesn\u8217\'92t take any effort to grow, the challenge, the art, is in knowing when to snip the bud.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ohhh, Shis.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Without even realizing it, the rock walls were folding around him, past him, and if he looked up at the soot-stained ceiling, he vivid sensation of falling upwards into it, imperceptibly at first, but soon enough the rock at the sides began to stretch, and the soot-stain began to congeal into a bottomless abyss. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The strange thing about this whole experience was that the movement of the rock did not  flow like in every other burgeon-sight, no elegant smoothing in and out, no sense of natural timing that one normally associates with God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bush. It was like the he was being summoned  up into the depths of the cosmos by some capricious deity who liked to play with his food before he ate it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His limbs could sense movement, even though he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 knew}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  there was none. There was a lightness in his chest, almost like his torso was in a perpetual state of being lifted off the ground. Mandri floated on the ground, and his mind was scrambling to keep an even keel, measuring out light years per second}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then came color, oozing out of the ceiling abyss like swirled ink, a dark and impenetrable blue, at first, then as the , it shifted through to purple and kept going, settled into a deep, suffocating Red. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t light, it was color given substance, and it flooded down onto Mandri, adhering to his skin, down onto the fire, sticking to the dancing flames, dampening their movement. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Color continued to pour out the ceiling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked. There was no reply. The color poured down, filling out like a fog, until all edges seemed to merge into each other, and soon Mandri could not tell where his. He tried to hold focus by reading out the distance measurements from his console, committing them to memory - but the apparent melting of the display just magnified the sensation of his mind\u8217\'92s disassembly. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Beyond this point, Mandri could not construct a coherent sequence of events. There were shapes, patterns, eyes. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d slipped into an unfamiliar psychedelic trance in which static and moving things merged into a third state, the ___ in which the artificial construction of reality that occurs within the brain begins to atrophy. Mandri just sat there like a newborn, wide-eyed, a sense-organ with no memory, only .}
