It is an enormous map, roughly two-men long and one-and-a-half tall, and as a child, Mandri studied every scratch of washed-out ink on that stitched-together ribbon of bleached lizard skin, which taken together look like an stiff puddle of curdled milk suffused with fungus. It occupied such a privileged position in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s imagination because the map wasn\u8217\'92t merely lines and labels, it was crawling with drawings of demons. Men with chicken heads and chicken feet breathed fire at the margins, chickens with lizard arms and phallic extrusions flopping on their backs pecked at little stick figures that represented humans. He studied that map more than any master-work, so much so that the names of places were firmly fixed in his memory\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Shusa,}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Plain of Woe\u8221\'94. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Kikarukabam}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where adulterers are split\u8221\'94. Zuudramu, \u8220\'93The Pits of Apostasy\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This map was made in the Old Jandri age by a priest of the name Batata. The story goes that Batata had set out into the Sand to discover which way the fabled Shurka river flowed. No one knew precisely where the river was\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 somewhere east\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Batata found it and settled the issue, he said it flowed west. Few believed him because he also claimed to have discovered the location of another fabled place\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the golden city of Kurbakee. There was a rich reward for discovering the way to Kurbakee, and Batata tried to claim it. When he was refused, and his directions were doubted, he convinced a royal map-maker to set out with him into the Sand and officially chart the way. Only Batata returned, some years later, carrying with him a map of Shis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribal consensus was that this map of Shis was a crude money making maneuver, and it worked, as some gullible merchant prince did eventually purchase it. The minority opinion claimed that the map was a spiritual scare tactic designed by Batata to further Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s kingdom. Scare tactics were common to scribes and priests in every age because virtue without terror is impotent. People have got to be scared of divine retribution, or else they\u8217\'92ll loosen their lips, loosen their hips, and start stabbing at anything that walks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both of these were workable explanations, but Mandri disagreed with them. He thought there was too much effort on display for it all to be a cynical lie. Because that map of Shis wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the only the map that Batata made. Some of the others outlined Jandri\u8217\'92s true shape, and one of these was the first to correctly place, more or less, each of the Sand\u8217\'92s eight portions. If he were correct about that, then what about those small dots that void the Sand like baby spiders, each with a postscript saying, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Shiskason}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , or, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Entrance into Shis.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 These dots were so far out into the desert that no rational person would try and verify their existence. Batata himself said that these dots were only approximations, and that he had only stumbled onto these pits in the earth by pure happenstance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 as they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re not things that can be seen from a distance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There is one moth-eaten scroll where Batata accounts his descent into one of these \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91gashes\u8217\'92. This descent is where he gained the knowledge of Shis\u8217\'92s outlay. It is a poetic work, without much poetic value, and it was written in a mind-numbing meter which could put the most Spark-bitten child to sleep. Half its lines were eaten away by bugs, and half of the rest didn\u8217\'92t need to be written at all, and yet, there was one refrain that stuck with Mandrameen throughout the years.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Batata recounted how he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been stumbling through the pitch black, torch in hand, when he came upon a relatively unassuming stone door frame. It was three simple grey-stone blocks, tall and narrow, with perfectly plumb and squared beams. Engraved into these pillars was an ancient verse. It rhymes in Old Jandri, but written out in common, it reads:}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be immortal.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Some claimed that Batata invented this verse out of whole cloth. Others took it up as a righteous creed that preached detachment from the world, and so they impressed the lines into their heads through blunt repetition. Batata himself claimed that it was a set of dark commandments, literal commandments that he named Schisol\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s creed, and he claimed that they must be obeyed if one were to pass under this threshold and move into the realm of Shis. The last line was especially grim, for according to Batata it implied that if the living wished to cross into that dark realm, they must bring along a ritual sacrifice. In exchange, Schisol\u8217\'92s servants would grant the ritualist immortality, and thus, he or she would never be called to Shis again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had forgotten this story by the time he followed Elrahet down into the dark passages which led deep underneath the Shulgi temple. These rock ways were a meandering maze of close darkness and heavy breathing, some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons just waiting for a chance to strike. Then Elrahet turned a tight corner and passed underneath an unassuming grey-stone frame with out so much as a shrug.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This door frame had perfectly plumb and squared columns.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Graven into its posts was Schisol\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s creed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Though Mandri had forgotten it, memory has a way of reconstructing , here manifested as a deep unease, and as every Jandri man is taught from the cradle, always follow the gut. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He hesitated.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl hustled past him with an annoyed shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah ran right along. She assumed Mandri was too weak to keep up with the pace. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no time for rest,\u8221\'94 she said as she disappeared into the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto, who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d taken up responsibility for the rear of their little file as they shuffled through the dark, paused before the gate. It was clear from the the language carved into the posts was foreign to him. kept on marching, and when Mandri lost sight of light of his torch, he dared a whisper to Obo, who still sat in his pack.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you know about Shis?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There are too many conflicting stories,\u8221\'94 Obo said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you see this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo climbed out of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack to peek over Mandri\u8217\'92s shoulder and get a gander.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s Batata\u8217\'92s screed,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what it is! I knew it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should keep moving, Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you know what this means!? This means Batata was telling the truth about Shis!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I doubt it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But this is proof!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is proof that he found some rocks with words carved onto it. Maybe he carved them himself. Mandri, we should be keeping pace with the others.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why? They\u8217\'92re casually strolling down into Shis\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and why? Because Elrahet said so? She could be leading us to a slaughter!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of signs. Mandri dared to reach out and touch them, and he found there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a single speck of dust polluting the grooves. Either they\u8217\'92d been cut yesterday, or someone was washing the rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93Whatever\u8217\'92s down here, I\u8217\'92ll handle it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice came bounding out of the dark tunnel ahead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93MANDRI!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo shouted back, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re coming!\u8221\'94, and then he gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri realized he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have a choice\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he stepped through the gate.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone threshold made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with a few thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs and that was it. And this path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. Elrahet and the others were creeping along this treacherous brink, with only a few cutout handholds keeping them from certain death.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once all the Ayramun had shimmied across, it was Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s turn. He tried to move but his knees were locked in fear. His armpits were practically sweating rain despite the chill that blew up from the fissure.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked at the ledge as it flickered in the torchlight. It was barely there.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come on,\u8221\'94 said Moto from the other side.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri tossed his torch across\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t about to try this with only one hand. Then he prayed a wordless prayer, stepped up to the abyss, and began to side-shuffle along the ledge. He was halfway across when a sliver of stone broke out from under his leading foot. He swayed out into the darkness, but he was able to pull himself against the rock wall and regained his balance, but he didn\u8217\'92t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the abyss, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up and nearly knocking Mandri loose. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They journeyed on and the rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. The walls were so narrow in places that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways, dragging his Obo laden pack behind like a stubborn dog. Elrahet marched through it all with purpose in her step. She spared no hesitation whenever a decision needed to be made about which dark and foreboding path to take. Mandri had expected this adventure under the earth would resemble their stumbling through the temple Shulgi\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 butting into dead ends and unremembered rooms, but that never happened. Elrahet had been here before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She led them into a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill, and this left Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hands cold and clammy, and he started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself, for his torch-light\u8217\'92s narration of these passages was unreliable\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows which he mistook for mere divots gave way to potholes to twist his ankle. And the longer it went on the less and less he cared about even these scrapes and bruises. He wondered if this malaise was a result of nearing to the core of Shis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He measured out time by measuring the weariness in his legs. The start of soreness in his calves was a sign that it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been at least four hands. Once the unremitting burn set into his thighs, well that marked at least a half-days journey. It was an accurate system, or so Mandri believed, because every time he reached the edge of giving up Elrahet stopped underneath a hang of rock and they rested, huddled around a small fire of twigs, though they rested only as long as it took for the fire to turn the twigs to ash. After the second rest like this, Mandri\u8217\'92s system of measurement was broke, because when they started out again his legs were already sore. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t until the fourth march that Mandri\u8217\'92s shoes slapped onto paved floor. This came as a great surprise because the walls were still rough hewn, and his feet were so used to stubbing their toes against unsettling bumps, that finding themselves on a surface as flat as screeded sand challenged their whole sense of reality. It was grey clay tiling, and engraved along the border of each square tile was a jagged chain of thorns. This hall spilled out into a larger one, and this larger hall opened up into a cavern that was so large that its size was impossible to say. The entirety of this cavern floor was paved in those tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps the pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. It was unfamiliar design, like a flower with it\u8217\'92s petals closed, and though Mandri had never seen its like before he knew it was a sign of Schisol. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The sound of their shuffling feet reverberated out into the emptiness, and they all hunched along as if sneaking. Mandri almost laughed at the sight of his skulking band, because if any nearby demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches. And they moved like this for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern\u8217\'92s end. They could go no further, for the grey stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a giant stone double-door that would take a team of oxen to open. These imposing doors were to sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures from which Batata had drawn inspiration. But these demons looked much more real when rendered in stone, and instead of whipping stick-figured humans, they were doing unmentionable things to men and women fully fleshed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Set atop these doors was a stone head in flat relief, bald like Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s, and twice as unnerving because it seemed to be licking its lips at sight of Mandri\u8217\'92s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders, and the rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly arms stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door\u8217\'92s bottom hinges.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Spark a fire,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet as she eyed the doors with wrinkled scorn.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto unstrapped his pack and pulled out a handful broken twigs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93More,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93All of it. We might be waiting here a while.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was thankful for the pause, though he wished Elrahet had picked a less conspicuous location. It seemed imprudent to make camp on the very doorstep of Shis, and judging from the nervous looks the others shared, he was not the only one to feel that way.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto recruited more wood from the others and set a campfire alight, making sure to keep a healthy distance away from the door. When that was done, he smothered everyone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s torch with the same rag that Obo had used to wipe himself clean of the Amalgamete\u8217\'92s stomach. Mandri, robbed of his own personal comfort flame, sat as close to the fire as he could. Meanwhile, Obo slid out of the litter to go and reflect upon the door.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Mazyd stilted along on his nubby arms, a swiveling gait, a pitiful sight, yet Obo moved with an air of confidence, and he plopped himself down in before those terrifying doors so that Schisol\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head at the top was staring down right at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said aloud, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are we going to open it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Open the doors of Shis!?\u8221\'94 exclaimed Moto. \u8220\'93Are you mad?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah added, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you think you\u8217\'92ll find?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s why I want to open it,\u8221\'94 said Obo as he studied the door\u8217\'92s manic display of torture. \u8220\'93I should very much like to see what all the fuss is about. After all, this is what we\u8217\'92ve come to see, isn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All eyes turned to Elrahet, for only she knew what they were doing down here.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet pulled Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack aside so that she could sit on it and warm her bony knees by the fire. When she had settled, she said, \u8220\'93Come and sit. I\u8217\'92ve a story to tell that you all need to hear.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo hurried over and sat down in the spot between Mandri and Purl. Moteah passed around a bag of jerked beef, while Moto was gracious enough to share a skin of beer\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 an unprecedented courtesy which led Mandri to wonder if this were a final meal. He chewed his food nervously as sounds echoed out of the cavern\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s starless sky\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 faint drips water, the soft hiss of wind gusting up through some unseen shaft, the scuffle and shrieking squeak of a rat who\u8217\'92d met his end in the jaws of a silent hunter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My story begins at the Beginning,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said, \u8220\'93When all existence belonged to a single Spark. Then Solrah came to be. No one know how She came to be. Somehow, the Spark was pierced and Solrah bled out of it as sap bleeds out of a tree. Memory of Solrah survived through her son, Solraheen, for though Solrah died in childbirth, Solraheen inherited Her mind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This was the second age, when all that existed was Solraheen and the Spark. This age was, I believe, the longest of them all, though there were no days, and there were no years\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there was no counting of time, and yet, well, it doesn\u8217\'92t matter. In the end, Solraheen grew lonely. He spoke the first word, and this word shattered the Spark, and from these fragments Solraheen created a garden world. He created land and sea for His enjoyment, and He created all manner of creatures for His companionship. He found this to be difficult, for the heat of the Spark withered stone and burned flesh and everything eventually died. But Solraheen was endlessly creative. He invented love, and in so doing he managed to tweak and bend the sacred Spark to defy death, for death was conquered with every new birth. He had created a creation which sustained itself\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 even created itself. Solraheen was proud, and like a proud parent he believed that His child should be free of His influence to continue on and define itself on its own terms. So he laid down to die, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, possessed by a different mind. This mind was none other than the mind of Schisol.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri hung tight to every word. This was not a telling he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard before. There were familiar elements, yes, but the telling was lured with heresy and forbidden knowledge, especially tantalizing was the suggestion that Solraheen and Schisol were of the same flesh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol awoke into Solraheen\u8217\'92s body like a newborn babe\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 without knowledge of the world or even Himself, or even of Solrah who came before. He wandered His brother\u8217\'92s garden as confused as any of us ever did. As the ages passed His mind matured, and He felt the heat of Sparked creatures and saw how their every breath was a flame, how their bodies were burning, slowly, until death. He saw an endless cycle of loneliness and pain, and he came to believe that creation was a corruption, that all Sparks had been shattered from a single Spark, and that to cure loneliness and death they should be reunited again into an eternally happy whole, in perfect communion with each other. So He set about destroying the garden, killing all creatures and joining their Sparks together. It took Him a long millennia, but in the end He prevailed. The last thing to join together with the whole was Himself, and so He killed Himself, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, this time, in the possession of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen awoke once again into a void next to the all-white Spark, and he saw that His creation had been erased. He had no memory of what had occurred while Schisol was in control of the body, and He had no memory of Schisol. He blamed Himself for His garden\u8217\'92s failure. Though His grief was immeasurable, He began His work again. This time He selected a number from amongst the creatures which roamed the earth and into them He invested Mind, so that they could, in His absence, act as stewards of all creation. These were the first humans, and they lived peaceably with each other, and they gave birth to Art, Philosophy, and a wondrous Civilization, so wondrous that Solraheen was once again satisfied again with His garden. As before, He laid down to rest so that His creation could come into its own, but instead of dying, His body rose again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol,\u8221\'94 Moto muttered in a breath of child-like wonder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol awoke into His worst nightmare, for He saw that the all-white Spark had once again been split, and another miserable garden was blossoming, trapping all the splinters of the Spark into a never-ending cycle of dread and despair. Amongst the lonely creatures that roamed this garden were the saddest, loneliest, most terrifying creatures imaginable\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 humans. Then one day Schisol saw a man kill himself out of heartbreak, and instead of that man\u8217\'92s Spark being reinvested into the Spark-ensnaring cycle, the man\u8217\'92s Spark was lost forever, dimming the whole should it ever be put back together again. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol set out again to destroy all creation. To hasten this end he explained to humanity their suffering, he taught them about the splitting of the Spark, and he enlisted their aid in destroying the. But some humans remembered the teachings of Solraheen, they remembered that they did not want to die, and so they resisted. Schisol inflicted tortures upon them, but this pain instead invested them with tremendous power, and they became the lesser gods. These forces arrayed themselves against Schisol and His minions. A cataclysmic battle took place. Schisol Himself was slain. But he was not completely dead, his body arose again, centuries later, and again, Solraheen walked the earth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The world He walked was a land laid waste by war. He asked the struggling humans what had occurred, but He did not believe their stories, for some amongst them were liars, still under the sway of Schisol\u8217\'92s corrupted teachings even if they did not know it. Solraheen selected from amongst them a girl, one whom he trusted, and he gave her the gift of immortal life that she might act as His envoy, for He was concerned that if He were to die again, then His garden would become corrupted again. He did what he could to regenerate the world, but Schisol\u8217\'92s minions conspired to end Him. They summoned an Amalgamete, one much greater than Greskal, and this creature gave birth to the foulest of demons and it murdered Solraheen. But again, He did not die, not completely.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He arose as Schisol, and Solraheen\u8217\'92s immortal envoy ran to Him, thinking, of course, that the He were Solraheen. It was then that the truth Their dual nature was revealed. Schisol learned that He Himself was responsible for all the suffering in this Garden, and His rage was boundless. Those were dark days, but when Schisol regained Himself, He came to believe that if he could communicate with Solraheen, He could convince Him that this garden was a perversion of the Spark, and that Solraheen would agree to put an end to all the senseless suffering. So, Schisol resolved to send a message to His twin brother\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but as He did not trust Solraheen\u8217\'92s envoy to do the message justice, Schisol raised up a young woman for Himself and gave her eternal life. With her He shared His corrupted message, and then He ended Himself, that Solraheen might arise and learn the truth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol\u8217\'92s envoy tried to convince Solraheen to destroy the world and reunite the Spark, but her message was ill received. Solraheen, in defiance of His brother\u8217\'92s wishes, regenerated the world anew. As you might guess, Schisol\u8217\'92s woman rallied Schisol\u8217\'92s minions, and they murdered Solraheen, and the world has been stuck in a cycling ever since. When Schisol lives, Solraheen\u8217\'92s blessed are martyred and their purified Sparks transform into gods who join together to undo Schisol\u8217\'92s terror. When Solraheen lives, Schisol\u8217\'92s minions raise up armies demons to undo Him. As you well know, we live in the age of Solraheen, but what has been done in this age has been done in no other\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in a desperate attempt to end the cycle, Solraheen called down a piece of the void and trapped Himself underneath it, so as to forever forestall Schisol\u8217\'92s return. Even if He were to be killed, Schisol would awaken trapped underneath a mountain of Fabled Black.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo spoke up and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I take that it didn\u8217\'92t work, else you wouldn\u8217\'92t need me to try and free Him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, it was a mistake. Solraheen hoped that with the battle over, that love and goodness would thrive and push Skisol\u8217\'92s minions back into their barrows under the earth. But He did not forsee what the Hrkan Lords would do to Him, or how they would twist his message. Without Solraheen\u8217\'92s guidance, Schisol\u8217\'92s creed has spread like weed, and I worry that the next cycle will come regardless, and when it does, there won\u8217\'92t be enough righteous men and women left to fight it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet stared longingly into the fire and the lines on her face grew deep. Elrahet when the disembodied voice of a woman as old as Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s poured forth into the cavern, filling up.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then came the grinding noise of stone sliding against stone. The great doors of Shis were swiveling in their hinges.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh?\u8221\'94 said Pell as she swayed towards the fire, her long black robe reflected a velvet sheen. \u8220\'93Have you come to see me, or have you come to tell these people lies?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I told no lies,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pell stopped a few yards away from the fire, careful not to enter the Ayramun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s circle. Moto and Moteah had yet to sheathe their swords.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, El, you can hardly blame the demons. They\u8217\'92ve only been waiting for five thousand years for these blessed days.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet chuckled and leaned on her walking stick. She said to Pell, gloating like a sore winner, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ve killed your Amalgamete.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pell delighted at the sight of Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grin curdle into a scowl. Pell reveled in the sense of dread she\u8217\'92d fixed in each of the Ayramun, until finally her eyes alighted on Mandri, and her smile turned to one of recognition, and even more, her gaze locked with his and it seemed for an instant that a veil had been lifted to reveal her true eyes underneath, bright and warm, golden threaded, communicating some mystical tiding which Mandri could not understand. Then the veil fell again, and her golden eyes were brown again, and she looked away, leaving Mandri to wonder if the others had caught it too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gentle Sparks,\u8221\'94 Pell said aloud, throwing her voice out into the cavern, \u8220\'93Would you please grace us with your presence?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Her request fell into the black, and a moment later the black began stir. The black }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 itself }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 began to stir. Mandri tried to rub the insanity out of his eyes, but that only made the sensation the sensation worse. Soon the stirring was by the growls, shrieks, and pitching laughter of demons\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 not just two or three or twenty, for as they made their way towards the fire, their eyes reflected its orange light\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 thousands of them. And not all had eyes, set, eyes set wide, eyes set narrow, compound eyes, spider eyes, eight of them swaying together in the black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first demon Mandri actually saw came crouching in a knuckle-walking strut. Its mouthless face was scrunched towards the middle, as if its skin was being pulled into its nose. Behind this disturbing sight, another set of glowing eyes stepped forth into the firelight, revealing a goat headed demon with black Zosan skin and a chiseled physique, and its feet were hooved as well. Both demons stopped just after they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d revealed themselves, and as other joined a circle around outer edge of the campfire\u8217\'92s light, a circle broken only by Pell and the doors of Shis behind her.}
