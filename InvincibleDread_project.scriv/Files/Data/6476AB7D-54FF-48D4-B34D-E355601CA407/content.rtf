It is an enormous map, roughly two-men long and one-and-a-half tall, and as a child, Mandri studied every scratch of washed-out ink on that stitched-together ribbon of bleached lizard skin, which taken together look like an stiff puddle of curdled milk suffused with fungus. It occupied such a privileged position in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s imagination because the map wasn\u8217\'92t merely lines and labels, it was crawling with drawings of demons. Men with chicken heads and chicken feet breathed fire at the margins, chickens with lizard arms and phallic extrusions flopping on their backs pecked at little stick figures that represented humans. He studied that map more than any master-work, so much so that the names of places were firmly fixed in his memory\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Shusa,}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Plain of Woe\u8221\'94. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Kikarukabam}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where adulterers are split\u8221\'94. Zuudramu, \u8220\'93The Pits of Apostasy\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This map was made in the Old Jandri age by a priest of the name Batata. The story goes that Batata had set out into the Sand to discover which way the fabled Shurka river flowed. No one knew precisely where the river was\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 somewhere east\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Batata found it and settled the issue, he said it flowed west. Few believed him because he also claimed to have discovered the location of another fabled place\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the golden city of Kurbakee. There was a rich reward for discovering the way to Kurbakee, and Batata tried to claim it. When he was refused, and his directions were doubted, he convinced a royal map-maker to set out with him into the Sand and officially chart the way. Only Batata returned, some years later, carrying with him a map of Shis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribal consensus was that this map of Shis was a crude money making maneuver, and it worked, as some gullible merchant prince did eventually purchase it. The minority opinion claimed that the map was a spiritual scare tactic designed by Batata to further Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s kingdom. Scare tactics were common to scribes and priests in every age because virtue without terror is impotent. People have got to be scared of divine retribution, or else they\u8217\'92ll loosen their lips, loosen their hips, and start stabbing at anything that walks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both of these were workable explanations, but Mandri disagreed with them. He thought there was too much effort on display for it all to be a cynical lie. Because that map of Shis wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the only the map that Batata made. Some of the others outlined Jandri\u8217\'92s true shape, and one of these was the first to correctly place, more or less, each of the Sand\u8217\'92s eight portions. If he were correct about that, then what about those small dots that  void the Sand like baby spiders, each with a postscript saying, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Shiskason}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , or, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Entrance into Shis.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 These dots were so far out into the desert that no rational person would try and verify their existence. Batata himself said that these dots were only approximations, and that he had only stumbled onto these pits in the earth by pure happenstance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 as they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re not things that can be seen from a distance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There is one moth-eaten scroll where Batata accounts his descent into one of these \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91gashes\u8217\'92. This descent is where he gained the knowledge of Shis\u8217\'92s outlay. It is a poetic work, without much poetic value, and it was written in a mind-numbing meter which could put the most Spark-bitten child to sleep. Half its lines were eaten away by bugs, and half of the rest didn\u8217\'92t need to be written at all, and yet, there was one refrain that stuck with Mandrameen throughout the years.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Batata recounted how he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been stumbling through the pitch black, torch in hand, when he came upon a relatively unassuming stone door frame. It was three simple grey-stone blocks, tall and narrow, with perfectly plumb and squared beams. Engraved into these pillars was an ancient verse. It rhymes in Old Jandri, but written out in common, it reads:}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Do not seek, for if you are pure, you will find the truth. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Do not obey, for if you have the truth, you will be in the right.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Do not teach, for if you are in the right, you will be followed.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Do not live, for if you are followed, you will be immortal.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i1
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Some claimed that Batata invented this verse out of whole cloth. Others took it up as a righteous creed that preached detachment from the world, and so they impressed the lines into their heads through blunt repetition. Batata himself claimed that it was a set of dark commandments, literal commandments that he named Schisol\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s creed, and he claimed that they must be obeyed if one were to pass under this threshold and move into the realm of Shis. The last line was especially grim, for according to Batata it implied that if the living wished to cross into that dark realm, they must bring along a ritual sacrifice. In exchange, Schisol\u8217\'92s servants would grant the ritualist immortality, and thus, he or she would never be called to Shis again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had forgotten this story by the time he followed Elrahet down into the dark passages which led deep underneath the Shulgi temple. These rock ways were a meandering maze of close darkness and heavy breathing, some of it seeming to come from outside the bounds of the torchlight\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no doubt the wheezing of giddy demons just waiting for a chance to strike. Then Elrahet turned a tight corner and passed underneath an unassuming grey-stone frame with out so much as a shrug.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This door frame had perfectly plumb and squared columns.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Graven into its posts was Schisol\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s creed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Though Mandri had forgotten it, memory has a way of reconstructing , here manifested as a deep unease, and as every Jandri man is taught from the cradle, always follow the gut. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He hesitated.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl hustled past him with an annoyed shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah ran right along. She assumed Mandri was too weak to keep up with the pace. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no time for rest,\u8221\'94 she said as she disappeared into the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto, who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d taken up responsibility for the rear of their little file as they shuffled through the dark, paused before the gate. It was clear from the  the language carved into the posts was foreign to him.  kept on marching, and when Mandri lost sight of light of his torch, he dared a whisper to Obo, who still sat in his pack.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you know about Shis?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There are too many conflicting stories,\u8221\'94 Obo said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri waved his torch over the graven letters in the rock. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you see this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo climbed out of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack to peek over Mandri\u8217\'92s shoulder and get a gander.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s Batata\u8217\'92s screed,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what it is! I knew it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should keep moving, Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you know what this means!? This means Batata was telling the truth about Shis!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I doubt it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But this is proof!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is proof that he found some rocks with words carved onto it. Maybe he carved them himself. Mandri, we should be keeping pace with the others.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why? They\u8217\'92re casually strolling down into Shis\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and why? Because Elrahet said so? She could be leading us to a slaughter!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The graven letters in the rock almost looked like stab wounds instead of signs. Mandri dared to reach out and touch them, and he found there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a single speck of dust polluting the grooves. Either they\u8217\'92d been cut yesterday, or someone was washing the rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93Whatever\u8217\'92s down here, I\u8217\'92ll handle it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice came bounding out of the dark tunnel ahead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93MANDRI!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo shouted back, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re coming!\u8221\'94, and then he gave Mandri an encouraging pat on the shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri realized he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have a choice\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he stepped through the gate.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What followed was a careful stumble down an uneven descent. Whoever had constructed that stone threshold made little effort to tame its passage, for the steeper drops were studded with a few thick blocks of wood masquerading as stairs and that was it. And this path eventually emptied out into a hole of endless black, with only a narrow foot-wide ledge around its rim to serve as a passage across. Elrahet and the others were creeping along this treacherous brink, with only a few cutout handholds keeping them from certain death.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once all the Ayramun had shimmied across, it was Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s turn. He tried to move but his knees were locked in fear. His armpits were practically sweating rain despite the chill that blew up from the fissure.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked at the ledge as it flickered in the torchlight. It was barely there.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come on,\u8221\'94 said Moto from the other side.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri tossed his torch across\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t about to try this with only one hand. Then he prayed a wordless prayer, stepped up to the abyss, and began to side-shuffle along the ledge. He was halfway across when a sliver of stone broke out from under his leading foot. He swayed out into the darkness, but he was able to pull himself against the rock wall and regained his balance, but he didn\u8217\'92t regain his wits until the falling stone banged against the bottom of the abyss, sending a stupefying far-flung BOOM echoing up and nearly knocking Mandri loose. Mandri hid his terror with a laugh. When he made it across, Obo suggested that perhaps, someone else should carry him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They journeyed on and the rock passages grew tighter, as if to swallow them up. The walls were so narrow in places that Mandri had to undo his pack and thrutch through them sideways, dragging his Obo laden pack behind like a stubborn dog. Elrahet marched through it all with purpose in her step. She spared no hesitation whenever a decision needed to be made about which dark and foreboding path to take. Mandri had expected this adventure under the earth would resemble their stumbling through the temple Shulgi\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 butting into dead ends and unremembered rooms, but that never happened. Elrahet had been here before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She led them into a tight zigzag of ceilingless fissures staccatoed by slumps of fallen rock. Past these they crawled through a jagged tube in the rock that swerved as it slid downhill, and this left Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hands cold and clammy, and he started to forget his fear of demons because he was more concerned with the rock itself, for his torch-light\u8217\'92s narration of these passages was unreliable\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hidden edges ripped at his woolen robe, shadows which he mistook for mere divots gave way to potholes to twist his ankle. And the longer it went on the less and less he cared about even these scrapes and bruises. He wondered if this malaise was a result of nearing to the core of Shis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He measured out time by measuring the weariness in his legs. The start of soreness in his calves was a sign that it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been at least four hands. Once the unremitting burn set into his thighs, well that marked at least a half-days journey. It was an accurate system, or so Mandri believed, because every time he reached the edge of giving up Elrahet stopped underneath a hang of rock and they rested, huddled around a small fire of twigs, though they rested only as long as it took for the fire to turn the twigs to ash. After the second rest like this, Mandri\u8217\'92s system of measurement was broke, because when they started out again his legs were already sore. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t until the fourth march that Mandri\u8217\'92s shoes slapped onto paved floor. This came as a great surprise because the walls were still rough hewn, and his feet were so used to stubbing their toes against unsettling bumps, that finding themselves on a surface as flat as screeded sand challenged their whole sense of reality. It was grey clay tiling, and engraved along the border of each square tile was a jagged chain of thorns. This hall spilled out into a larger one, and this larger hall opened up into a cavern that was so large that its size was impossible to say. The entirety of this cavern floor was paved in those tiles, an endless sea of them, and every twenty steps the pattern was broken up by a larger square engraved with an inverted sun. It was unfamiliar design, like a flower with it\u8217\'92s petals closed, and though Mandri had never seen its like before he knew it was a sign of Schisol. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The sound of their shuffling feet reverberated out into the emptiness, and they all hunched along as if sneaking. Mandri almost laughed at the sight of his skulking band, because if any nearby demons wanted to know what had disturbed their slumber, all they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have to do was open their eyes and see a flock of fools spotlighted by their own torches. And they moved like this for half a hand, not speaking a word, until they arrived at the cavern\u8217\'92s end. They could go no further, for the grey stone wall in front of them ran straight up into the dark, featureless save for a giant stone double-door that would take a team of oxen to open. These imposing doors were to sized to the height and shoulders of gods, and every inch of them were carved with figures, demonic figures from which Batata had drawn inspiration. But these demons looked much more real when rendered in stone, and instead of whipping stick-figured humans, they were doing unmentionable things to men and women fully fleshed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Set atop these doors was a stone head in flat relief, bald like Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s, and twice as unnerving because its petrified gaze seem to snatch at Mandri\u8217\'92s Spark. This head was set into the lintel, which was itself carved to look like spreading shoulders, and the rest of the door frame was sculpted to look like arms, and these long and spindly things stretched down to the floor where the hands cupped the door\u8217\'92s bottom hinges.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There were no graven words to title the figure, but Mandri knew without knowing that this was Schisol, and His arms cradled the doors of Shis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Spark a fire,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet as she greeted those doors with a wrinkled sneer.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto unstrapped his pack and pulled out a few twigs }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93More,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93All of it. We might be waiting here a while.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was thankful for the pause, but he wished she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d picked a safer spot. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is this what you wanted to show me?\u8221\'94 Obo asked, reflecting upon the door.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you think lies beyond those slabs of stone?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If the door\u8217\'92s illustration is any indication, it must be a place of great spiritual torment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chewing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was once, but it is no longer. If we do not act, it will be that way again, and they\u8217\'92ll be coming for you, too, Mazyd. You might have been hidden from demon-sight before, but now you have a Spark like the rest of us. You\u8217\'92ve doomed yourself.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Dark pressing in? Illusory sppech, instead, Obo let her speak.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your makers believe that there is only one god left\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only one god that Schisol\u8217\'92s minions could not scratch. They believe that Solraheen is the last vestige of divinity in this world, and they believe it because it suits them. That it is not the truth, for as long as Solraheen survives, so, too does Schisol. Such is the nature of Good and Evil\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 each is defined by the presence of the other.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not sure I agree with that accounting of evil,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93But please, continue.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Could dry a bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The first Spark was Solrah, and she died giving birth to Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solrah was a man,\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93From Solrah came Solraheen. Solraheen was alone, and so He created a garden world for His enjoyment. He created all manner of creatures for His companionship. In His eye, it was perfection. So elegant was its forms that Solraheen laid himself down to die for even His own hand should not get in the way of its function. So he laid down to die, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, possessed by a different mind. This mind was Solraheen\u8217\'92s twin, Schisol.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A telling he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d not heard before. Elements, yes, but not in this particular order. Especially not the idea that Solraheen and Schisol were of the same flesh. This was heresy of the highest crown.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol awoke without knowledge of Solrah or Solraheen, or even of the void which came before. He wandered His brother\u8217\'92s garden as confused as any newborn babe. As the ages passed, His mind matured, and he began to piece together a corrupted view creation. He saw that the living things had Sparks, and he saw that the living things were sad and lonely, and He came to believe that this loneliness was the result of a shattering, that a single, all-white Spark had exploded and that its splinters had become trapped in the net that is the material world. He believed it was His duty to fix this, to reunite all Sparks into a single whole, and so He set out to kill all life and merge their Sparks together. It took him a long millenia, but in the end he prevailed. The last thing to join the whole was Himself, and so He killed Himself, but He did not fully die, for against His will His body woke again, this time, in the possession of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen awoke once again into the void and saw that His creation had been erased. And because He had no memory of what had occurred while Schisol was in control of the body, He blamed Himself for the disappearance of His garden. Though his grief was immeasurable, He began his work again. This time He selected a number from amongst the creatures which roamed the earth and into them He invested Mind, so that they could, in His absence, act as stewards of all creation. These were the first humans, and they all lived peaceably with eachother until Solraheen was satisfied  again with His garden. Then, as before, Solraheen laid down to rest so that His creation could come into its own, but instead of dying, His body rose again, this time in control of Schisol.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol awoke into His worst nightmare, for He saw that the all-white Spark had once again been split, and another miserable garden was blossoming, trapping all the splinters of the Spark into a never-ending cycle of dread and despair. Amongst the lonely creatures that roamed this garden were the saddest, loneliest, most terrifying creatures imaginable\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 humans. Schisol saw a man kill himself out of heartbreak, and instead of that man\u8217\'92s Spark being reinvested into the garden\u8217\'92s Spark-ensnaring cycle, the man\u8217\'92s Spark was lost forever, dimming the whole should it ever be put back as one. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol set about again to ending this abomination, and to hasten this end he taught humanity about the splitting of the Spark, and he enlisted their aid and destroying all of creation. Some humans remembered the teachings of Solraheen, they remembered that they did not want to die, and so they resisted. The tortures inflicted upon them summoned the lesser gods from the void, and these forces arrayed themselves against Schisol and His minions. A cataclysmic battle took place, in which Schisol Himself was slain. But he was not completely dead, his body arose again, centuries later, this time in the control of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen woke up into a land laid waste by war. He asked the struggling humans what had occurred, but He did not believe their stories, for some amongst them were still under the sway of Schisol\u8217\'92s corrupted teachings. Solraheen selected a young girl from amongst them, one whom he trusted, and he gave her the gift of immortal life, that she might act as His envoy throughout the ages, for he grew worried, that if He were to die again his garden would be corrupted. His worries were well-founded, for Schisol\u8217\'92s minions conspired to end Solraheen, and in this they succeeded\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they summoned an Amalgamete, the same as Greskal, and this creature gave birth to a demon which murdered Solraheen.}

It was then that the truth Their dual nature was revealed. When Schisol learned that He Himself was responsible for the garden, for the continuance of the splitting of the Spark, he grew dismayed. He came to believe that if he could just communicate with Solraheen about how this garden was a perversion of the Spark, that Solraheen would agree to put an end to this cycle of suffering. So, Schisol resolved to send a message to Solraheen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but as He did not trust Solraheen\u8217\'92s consort to do the message justice, Schisol raised up a young woman for Himself and gave her eternal life. With her He shared his corrupted message, and then he ended Himself, that Solraheen might arise and learn the truth.}
