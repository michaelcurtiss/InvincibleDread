\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Why?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It would humor me. Man gave up so much to grab be, only to have to honor my last wish.  Might humble him, before his end.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Start to have a discussion about what to do next. Intro what Mazyd wants: You have some ability to control the spark. I want that. I want to be released from the binds that chain me.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Interrupted by sight of travelers on the horizon. How did they find us. Mazyd reveals there is a tracker inside of him that shades are drawn to. There is no escape. Not going to help this time unless we can come to a deal.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram is like, we can deal with this ourselves.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There is a skirmish???}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Decide to head to shagota - Salavan is the only person who knows the mazydai outside of the guild. (Salavan was a former guild member who was expelled because he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have the right temperment).

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 - Pyetle is premier artist in the land. Or he *was*. In Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s heretical religion, Artists are the highest of the highest caste. Artists are the ones who come closest to minds touching, the way it is *supposed* to be, all unified in the Urguma (the divine spark). those who feel compelled by nature to rejoin with others and so they create. There is nothing more sacred, other than death. The highest tier of the highest cast - above even the philosophers and priests, for while the philosopher priests study the Urge, the artists are driven by it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moonrahuun communicates only through images, and so requires an artist to recreate these images to convey the message to the people. Moon doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t make the images himself because he won\u8217\'92t sully his hands with whatever.}
