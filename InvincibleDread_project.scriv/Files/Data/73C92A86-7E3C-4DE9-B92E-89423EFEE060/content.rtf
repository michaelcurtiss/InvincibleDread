\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The garden holds a sacred place in Solitant cosmology. Every distinguished person who is looking to appear the part has one. Mandri had seen his fair share. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d walked under the royal palms of Skriniar, and he\u8217\'92d seen the terraced falls of Luzee. His favorite, by far, was the roselily pond of Delfikood. None of them compared to Salavan\u8217\'92s garden, not because Salavan\u8217\'92s was better, they just weren\u8217\'92t comparable. All those other gardens were thirsty greenscapes, accented by vibrant petals and the glow of the atmosphere reflecting off water. Salavan\u8217\'92s garden was a garden of stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had been to countless parties where slush-drunk revelers would try outdo each other with stories of exotic gardens, and he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d never once heard of a garden composed entirely of curated stone. So, when Mandri stepped through Salavan\u8217\'92s gate and onto a plane of bone-white pebbles, he gasped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a true garden. It obeyed all the rules a young artist learns when scribbling out compositions for clients. First and foremost is to establish a hierarchy of form; if there are stones they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve got to come in different sizes: big, medium, and small, at the very least. Arrange them in such a way so as to draw the eye, or in this case, a person, through a maze of perception and towards what is important. It was about contrast. Most rules of thumb in art have to do with manipulating contrast. Sharp against soft. Dark against light. Many against few. Big against little. Here, a rippling sea of smooth white pebbles bounced up against jagged knots of gray granite, granite which grew in size as the snow-white stone pooled in the Asharaheendle of the yard, in the center of which stood a towering spike of Fabled Black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t believe his eyes. Outside of the Jeket\u8217\'92s cavern temples, he\u8217\'92d only seen tiny fragments of Fabled Black in satin lined boxes, resting on pillows, shielded by glass. Here was an jagged obelisk of it, as tall and as wide as the four-story sandstone pillars that held up the roof of the great mansion behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Fabled Black. The skewering stone. A shard of the firmament. The quintessence of night. If it were a tree, and the pebbles, grass, and the granite, bushes, it all would have been too deliberate, a stilted garden, devoid of the subtle spontaneity of Nature. But this was a god-killing stone, and so the stasis, the absence of vibrant life, that was the point.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri walked up to the obelisk. He saw his own reflection in its surface sheen split by streaks of rain. He looked worse than he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ever been; eyes red and witless, face gaunt and sallow, lips cracked, and his sodden hair clung to tight to his meatless skull. He looked like death. Perhaps everyone who looked into it looked like death.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 An unbidden voice rose out of the ether behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This stone makes the most wondrous pigment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Standing five feet behind Mandri, was a massive man. He stood two heads taller than Mandri and was easily thrice his size. His barrel of a body was draped in a white silk robe, and his face was Jandrian through and through: high cheeks, a strong brow, and narrow eyes. The only outlier was his hair; instead of the usual scruff of Jandri black, it was as white as his robe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t look like a demon. There was a genteel air about him, accentuated, perhaps, by the fact that he kept his great bulk dry through the use of a tiny, black-lacquered umbrella.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This large man looked past Mandrameen towards the obelisk and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It makes a black that rivals the crow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri snuck a look behind at the Fabled Black. He wanted to ask how this man had come into possession of such a thing, and why he dared to keep it outdoors. A spire of Fabled Black like this must be worth a mountain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am Salavan,\u8221\'94 the man said. \u8220\'93And you are the great Mandrameen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am, but I would not say great. It almost sounds like you\u8217\'92re insulting me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would never. I love your work. I was hoping that some day you\u8217\'92d find your way to my door.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri spread his arms out wide to present himself, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Here I am.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And I see you\u8217\'92ve found my stone.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes I was suprised to see such wonder veiled.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan chuckled his mirthy girth, then walked up the to the spike of Fabled Black and set his meaty hand upon it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is incredible isn\u8217\'92t it? Only a small sliver of the comet which buried Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would ask how it got here, but I suspect I know the answer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It isn\u8217\'92t stolen, if that\u8217\'92s what you are getting at. I paid for it. Paid for it with bribes, but nonetheless I paid for it. Provisions for the smuggling alone cost me thirty-five silver strings.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, I paid for it. So what if that money went to poorer people than it was supposed to? Maybe we can say it was an act of charity. Charity for the people who moved it and the thing itself. A thing like this belongs in a place of prominence, not shuttered away in some dim Jeketian cave. Here, it\u8217\'92s out in the air, where it should be. You can touch it if you like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No thanks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re right, there\u8217\'92s no need.\u8221\'94 Salavan pulled his hand away from the rock. \u8220\'93Merely being in its presence is enough.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes ran up the stone\u8217\'92s spine. Fabled Black was notorious for its aura. A small shard of it could make the happiest child feel chill and rotten. Here in such quantity, that feeling crept down to the bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everything that falls from the sky radiates sadness. There\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s really on the two: Fabled Black, and rain. Dead birds as well, if you\u8217\'92re a good enough shot. Why it should be that everything falling from the sky is depressing is a point of contention in the world at large. Either the heavens are a void of a despair and these elemental things, coming from the heavens, are infused with that despair, or in the grand cosmology of the universe, earth is a supremely disappointing place, and so things cast down upon it radiate a longing to be somewhere else. Wouldn\u8217\'92t rain prefer to be in the clouds? Wouldn\u8217\'92t Fabled Black prefer to float in between the stars? Mandri was certain that the source of all despair was set much closer to the ground, and since human beings live in that clime, well, put one and one together.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can feel the weight of history in it,\u8221\'94 Salavan said. \u8220\'93The Black feels alive. In a very real sense, it is alive. I can\u8217\'92t wait to show you what comes of it. Would you like to see?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan spared Mandri a beneficent smile. His teeth were sparkling white, like Pell\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t have a choice, do I?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What gave you that idea?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pell said that if I didn\u8217\'92t come and see you, she would kill me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She said exactly that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And here you are, seeing me, yes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then you have fulfilled that obligation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scrunched up his face at the sense of it. It was too legalistic. A demon-witch didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t seem like the kind of creature to care about the strict definitions of words. Mandri imagined himself screaming out, \u8220\'93But I did what you said, I saw him!\u8221\'94 as Pell ripped out his innards.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, I won\u8217\'92t have this }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 tension}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  in my house. You are safe here, and you are free to leave at any time. Or, if you are at all curious about what may lay in store for you, then say it, and we shall find it out together.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not a eunuch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, I am aware. Would you like to come inside?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan crossed his brows and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Assert yourself, boy. I won\u8217\'92t have have any of this }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 meekness}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  in my house either. Stand up straight if you can. Goodness. You look like you were born yesterday.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Screw you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is better. Come.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Salavan turned and skirted around the spike of Fabled Black. The way Salavan moved, it was dainty and deliberate, completely at odds with his massive size. He was careful to keep the hem of his robe out of any puddles, and his umbrella was so small that he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t walk at stride without the rain splashing his legs, so he sort of shuffled across his stone yard, looking to Mandri like a great white pig tiptoeing its way through a briar patch. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri followed. Once he was inside the safety of the mansion\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grand portico, where Salavan gave him a well-practiced look of concern.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re soaked,\u8221\'94 Salavan said, \u8220\'93A towel and a change of clothes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed out of some hidden orifice carrying a towel and a white linen tunic. Mandri was dried and fitted with the tunic, which ended at the knees, then he and Salavan proceeded on inside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The white stone floor was cold under Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you like my home?\u8221\'94 Salavan said. \u8220\'93It cost me fifty silver strings to import the lumber to burn the lime for the plaster, and that was just for the outer wall. This interior, the plaster, the paints, that cost\u8230\'85 well, I don\u8217\'92t want to go on and on about expenses.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan gave a smug and self-aware smile that said that bragging about expenses was exactly he wanted to do. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Was the house extravagant? Yes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Was it impressive? Not really.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Unlike the garden outside, the place met expectations. Mandri could have been standing inside any number of the miniature palaces that scabbed the Hrkan world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tall arched ceilings. Wide halls. Sparsely decorated. Everything white. No lamps, or torches, for fear the soot might stain that whiteness. Only natural light, Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s light, was allowed in. Today that color was a rainy grey, which didn\u8217\'92t do much to illuminate the vast interior. It almost seemed colder to be inside than out in the rain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This austerity was not unusual, for the whiteness, the emptiness, was a religious expression of sorts. White is the most sacred color. White for the all-white spark. True White does not exist in the material world, save for the glow of Solraheen, but in the Hrkan practice of the Solitant art, it was seen as a pious thing to strive for pure whiteness. The ostentation of color was to be abhorred, unless it was bounded by a frame. Art, painting, these were sacred things too, but the building itself had to be silent. It was said that Solraheen would refuse to dwell in a place that presumed to outshine him.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But piety is no constraint on the rat race of the rich. The cleanliness, the whiteness, the starkness, these were the rules of the competition. The richness of scale was a ___. Judge the floor; a rich man could afford to have a white floor because he could afford to employ a person or persons to wipe up the filth of feet. Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s floor was as white as the sway-away ceiling. As he and Mandri walked along, a girl was crouching behind with bowl of water and a brush, scrubbing away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do you find my home?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Very clean,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. Perhaps you will find my gallery stimulating. I\u8217\'92ve some pieces here that you won\u8217\'92t see anywhere else\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but that goes without saying.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How many of those are stolen?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The accusation put a hitch in Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s step. Amused at Mandri\u8217\'92s cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93None of them are stolen. Aside from that shard of Fabled Black, I\u8217\'92ve acquired everything I own through perfectly legal means. I even have something of yours here. One of your best works, I think.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Spare me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t be modest, Mandri. I won\u8217\'92t have it. Not in this house.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan clapped his hands and another servant came forth from some windowed orifice, carrying a shallow bowl lined with finger-length wraps of freeweed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If paintings aren\u8217\'92t your pleasure, how about a wrap of freeweed?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know if you can tell, but I\u8217\'92m high as Shis on burgeons right now.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan looked genuinely surprised. He wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a man capable of faking emotions, having spent so much time trying to get rid of them. \u8220\'93You are remarkably lucid,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93You do have that hopeless look about you, but I supposed that was, you know, the general malaise of the indigent.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan selected a wrap for himself, put it in a pocket inside his robe, and waved the servant away. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Freeweed doesn\u8217\'92t mix well with burgeons, does it? We shall skip the freeweed, and we\u8217\'92ll skip the gallery tour. You came here for a purpose, after all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93About that. I can tell you right now that I\u8217\'92m not a\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan raised his hand, and that shut Mandri right up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t tell me anything. I should say that I know more about you than you know about yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s my mother\u8217\'92s name?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t pollute my mind with such trifles. The knowledge I have is more fundamental.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What does that even mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Would you say that you know more about a lizard than a lizard knows about itself?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Of course Mandri did, but he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t going to concede the point. Lizards aren\u8217\'92t humans. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan an impatience. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are going to need it explained to you,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Come. We must study at least one piece of art. Come.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The ceiling of Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s second floor was even higher than the first, and common to the fashion of the Hrkan elite, what few furnishings there were, were muted. If there was a table, it was carved from a pale sandstone. If there was a chair, its legs were simple, bark-stripped, sanded branches, and its seat was woven reed. If there was a tapestry, it was devoid of color and image, for its purpose was to be a frame for the subtleties of Solraheen\u8217\'92s light, which there wasn\u8217\'92t much of. The place was . Mandri breathed a sigh of releif when Salavan led him into bright light of a round atrium.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Like Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s garden, this atrium was devoid of plant and tree. Rain pattered down through the open roof and tapped upon a floor of white pebbles. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  were pillows upon pillows for comfort, all white with gold tassels and ivory lace threading them together.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 On the opposite atrium wall, there was a fresco. It was this to which Salavan had set his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a magnificent work of art in skill and in subject. It depicted Solraheen at the very moment of his apotheosis\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the god of white stretched out across the wall, his face a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his sword as he plunged it into Schisol\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is my favorite piece.\u8221\'94 Salavan said contentedly. \u8220\'93For sentimental reasons, mostly. It has so much behind it, if you know what I mean.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See this yellow, isn\u8217\'92t it beautiful?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He was pointing to the golden rays which emanated out from Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head. It really was a fantastic yellow, extraordinarily vibrant, as if it had just been painted on and was halfway dry.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can you guess the pigment?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have no idea.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This yellow, it comes from the Gabo cow. Incredibly expensive. The most wasteful pigment imaginable. To make enough for this fresco I had to buy three men to care for fifty cows. Had to put them on a strict diet, the cows. They couldn\u8217\'92t eat anything but this little squeaking bug, called a zuberant. They look like a locust the size of your thumb, well, my thumb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They come in hives so they aren\u8217\'92t too expensive. You make a paste out of them and feed them to the cows, and you have to stuff their bellies full all at once. That means you\u8217\'92ve got to starve them a bit so they take to that bug-paste like dogs to the bone. Then you have to time the next step just right, because, see, this radiant pigment comes from the chyme of the cow\u8217\'92s second stomach. You have to be precise with the cutting. You have wait until the munched up bugs extrude into that second stomach, not the first or third stomach, the second stomach, and that\u8217\'92s when you cut open the beast and harvest as much this yellow chyme as you can.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Interesting.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Once you have the chyme, you can sell the meat. But I don\u8217\'92t sell the meat. I let it rot in the sun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because it feels\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Salavan waved his hand in the air as if to catch the words that could accurately describe what he was thinking. \u8220\'93It feels weighty to have killed a herd of beasts for the explicit purpose of painting my wall. Doesn\u8217\'92t Solraheen look radiant? And now that you know fifty cows died to make it seem so, doesn\u8217\'92t that make the fresco take on a more\u8230\'85a more\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It doesn\u8217\'92t do anything for me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s round face lit up and he laughed. \u8220\'93Hah! It doesn\u8217\'92t do anything, does it! It\u8217\'92s only a color after all. It is what it is, history be damned. Yet the image is fine, no? The quality of the drawing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t be that way, Mandri. It is beautiful. This is Ellag\u8217\'92s hand. I trust you are familiar with her work?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She\u8217\'92s here. Would you like to see her?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not really, no.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Unfortunate, because seeing her is the first step in determining whether or not you\u8217\'92re the one that we are looking for.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hold on, who is this, \u8216\'91we\u8217\'92?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We are worshipers of Asharaheen. Did Pell not tell you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have no idea who that is, except that, apparently, he doesn\u8217\'92t exist.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know who Asharaheen is, you just know him by a different name. You know him as Schisol.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan points to the black god being stabbed by Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You worship the evil one?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol, Asharaheen, he is not evil.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked at the fresco again. Schisol\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s horns and shrieking eyes were a stark contrast to Solraheen\u8217\'92s resplendent face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He looks evil to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, well, I must keep up appearances. Imagine a Hrkan prince comes striding into my hall and discovers me to be a heretic. That would be the end of me, wouldn\u8217\'92t it? But we followers of Asharaheen are followers of the good.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pell ripped out Gil\u8217\'92s stomach.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who is Gil?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My ox.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s evil about killing an ox? Have you never cooked a slab of tripe?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She didn\u8217\'92t eat the stomach. She ate his spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brows raised.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You mustn\u8217\'92t judge her, Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looks at him like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s insane.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everyone grows up hearing scary stories about demons and demonesses stealing little boys out beds to consume their sparks for sustenance. I grew up with those stories, too. It is amazing how a shameless twist of truth written down a few thousand years ago can become a foundational pillar of belief.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I saw what I saw.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t deny that you did, but Mandri, but you did not understand what you saw. Pell was not, as they say, consuming that spark for sustenance.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure as shit looked like she was.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan sighed in frustration and rested his hands on his belly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come now, Mandri. Indulge, for a moment, the idea that you have been deceived, that everything you know about Schisol and Solraheen is all a lie. The heavens, the earth, the very nature of existence itself, is not what you think it to be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you know the truth?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No living person knows the whole truth, but one thing is certain: the story of how Solraheen came to be buried under the earth is a lie.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you talking about? I\u8217\'92ve been to Jeket.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They let you see Him?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No\u8230\'85but I know He\u8217\'92s there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is there, yes, crushed under all that rock and Fabled Black. But unlike you, I have been allowed into the Jeketian caves, and I have glimpsed His face, and I\u8217\'92ll tell you, He did not look pleased with His situation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why would He? He\u8217\'92s crushed under a comet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should see what they do to Him. They inundate his air with deadening fumes. They carve slivers from his flesh to fuel their abominations.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You mean the Mazydai?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I mean abominations. Think of it, Mandri, if it weren\u8217\'92t for the power of the Mazydai, the Hrks would never have conquered the outland tribes. This story that you\u8217\'92ve heard, that a stone of night fell from the sky and Solraheen saved the world by absorbing the crushing blow with his own body, well, it is simple and neat, but it is not the truth.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan put his fat finger up on the fresco, and he poked he Schisol\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly, right where Soloraheen\u8217\'92s sword burst forth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A click sounded out from under the floor, and a square of stone levered open to reveal a narrow stairway descending into darkness. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Before we head down, I must demand from you your utmost commitment. I, unlike the Solitants, value honesty, so my good character compels me to warn you that there is a chance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a chance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that as we attempt to divine your role in the divine plan, you could die. It\u8217\'92s only a chance, and a small one at that. Consider the thought before you join me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan hiked up the hem of his robe, and disappeared down into the dark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stared down into that inky blackness, and not a thought went through his head. He must have stared for quite a while, because Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice echoed up, saying, \u8220\'93I said consider the thought, don\u8217\'92t inhabit it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A servant girl close the hatch behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At the bottom of the stairs was a short tunnel, and at the end of this tunnel was a large room. In this room was a fire in a bronze brazier, and three wooden chairs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In one of these chairs sat a body covered in a white sheet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t look so pale, Mandri. I told you not to come down here if you weren\u8217\'92t committed. You\u8217\'92re here, and now you\u8217\'92re here. Do you understand?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sit down.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri took the seat farthest away from the person sheet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan pulled the wrap of freeweed from his pocked, and he lit it in the brazier\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s flames. He puffed it thrice to get it going, then sat down in the chair next to the sheet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So!\u8221\'94. He clapped his hands. \u8220\'93Are you the Eunuch Painter? The Painted Eunuch? Or is it simply, the painter who doesn\u8217\'92t want to be a painter? You\u8217\'92d be surprised about how many of those we find.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan sighed and puffed on his wrap.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are your wits here, Mandri? Are you here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Use your voice. Assert yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri cleared his throat and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who is that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93As I\u8217\'92ve said already, it is possible that you could die. Ellag died. I keep her around for the purpose of demonstration, and I think, her presence will help put you into the right frame of mind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s Ellag?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chair creaked as the man laid back into it. He blew a puff of smoke out the side of his mouth, as if the smoke could go anywhere in this cramped room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me, Mandri, what do you think Art is? If you could define it. Define Art.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wondered what Salavan was getting at.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Art is whatever you want it to be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t be coy, Mandri. This is important. You must be eased into the right frame of mind before we move on to the next step.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I just don\u8217\'92t think it\u8217\'92s an interesting question, and I\u8217\'92m more concerned about what\u8217\'92s under that sheet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that why you don\u8217\'92t want to paint anymore, you think it\u8217\'92s uninteresting?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93More or less.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Which is it, more, or less? Be specific. You\u8217\'92ve spent too much time in front of an easel not to have some idea of what it is that you are doing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I make pretty pictures.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan rolled his eyes and took a long drag from his wrap. He held the smoke in his great big chest, and then as he exhaled, his shoulders slumped like the life had gone from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think Art is merely a word,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93You think that it\u8217\'92s a label that people slap onto things for utility.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t say that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then say something. I\u8217\'92m trying help you avoid ending up like Ellag here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan puts his arm around Ellag\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder and gave her body a friendly shake. Her head rolled limply on her neck and then into the crook of Salavan\u8217\'92s shoulder as if she were looking to cuddle. As she did, the sheet pulled taught over her face, and a smear of blood welled up to stain the fibers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan narrowed his eyes, glared at Mandrameen, and the moment of unease passed between them. Only when it was good and gone did the big man grunt and huff and say, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Answer the gods-damned question.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is she dead?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What was the question?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is Art?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It doesn\u8217\'92t matter what Art is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It does, Mandri, it does. You see, Ellag\u8217\'92s answer was wrong. That\u8217\'92s why she\u8217\'92s dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t understand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She thought of Art like this,\u8221\'94 Salavan paused, pushed Ellag back onto her own chair, and leaned forward in his char. He said, \u8220\'93A person goes out into the world and has some incredible experience\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 like you\u8217\'92re having now. It changes them in some important, fundamental way. They are a different person because of it. They look at the world differently. But how could any of their friends or family know that any of this has happened? The change is internal. It is not written on the skin. There\u8217\'92s not some new sparkle in the eye. Their behavior might be different, but that can never communicate the depth of what is going on inside the mind. Consider a woman crying\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 for what reason does she cry? She tells you her child has died, but you\u8217\'92ve never had a child, Mandri, so how could you understand? This is the problem which Art purports to solve. A work of art is an attempt to break through that impenetrable barrier between our minds.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Not one word of that made it into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ear. He was thinking about what must be under that sheet, and about how Salavan liked to hear himself talk. The man was so wrapped up in his words, and in the freeweed\u8217\'92s smoke, that he might not notice Mandri dashing for the stairs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what Ellag thought. She thought that art is thing people do to let everyone else to know what\u8217\'92s going on inside.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded along.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Does that make sense?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s very sentimental.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Isn\u8217\'92t it? Art as a form communication. Sentimental, yes, that\u8217\'92s the word for it. Unfortunately, it is completely and utterly wrong. Look how wrong it can be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb grabbed the crown of Ellag\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sheet, and in one quick flourish, he revealed Ellag\u8217\'92s corpse. Eyes seemingly gouged out.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Steady, Mandri. Steady yourself, man\u8230\'85 Now, looking at Ellag, you might be wondering what I am attempting to communicate with this work of art. You might think that I am the artist, and this,\u8221\'94 he put his hand on Ellag\u8217\'92s skull and twisted it about in a perverse display of puppetry. \u8220\'93This is me communicating to you in a way that lets you experience, in a profound way, who I am and what it\u8217\'92s like to be me. \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He let go of Ellag\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head, and it slumped down into her collarbone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But none of that is true. For a number of reasons. Consider, why isn\u8217\'92t speech, casual speech like I\u8217\'92m doing now, why isn\u8217\'92t that considered Art? I am manipulating my throat, tongue, teeth, and lips to shape a string of sounds for you to experience. This is communication. Art is communication, yes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At this point the freeweed was working its into Salavan. He was starting to gesticulate with his hands.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. I am not an artist. I am many things, but I am not an artist.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a murderer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not a murderer, either.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He took another big drag from from his freeweed. His gesticulations were getting more and more frenetic, cutting Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s statements with a slice of the hand, swirling his own as if he were aerating a fine wine. He paused, then said, \u8220\'93Actually, that\u8217\'92s not true, I am a murderer. But I think you\u8217\'92re referring to Ellag, here. I didn\u8217\'92t kill Ellag. She died because she thought painting was communication. She thought the painter was important. Like you, she thought far too much of herself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That couldn\u8217\'92t be further from the truth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We shall see. Ellag was never able to make that step. She\u8217\'92d never seen the abyss with her own self, so when she looked into the deep\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan made an explosion with his fingers, pretending to burst his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Her eyes exploded?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about her chest?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh. That was me.\u8221\'94 Seeing the horror on Mandri\u8217\'92s face, he added, \u8220\'93That was all after the fact, I assure you. Let\u8217\'92s not get distracted.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you insane? You tell me my eyes are going explode, and you don\u8217\'92t want me to get distracted?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is only one potentiality. Besides, would that not be a wonderful end? Imagine seeing a thing so holy that your eyes explode. That\u8217\'92s how every painter dreams of dying, no?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He was sweating.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan sauntered off into a dark corner of the room, and starts dragging stone slab. The grating sound of stone against stone Mandri want scream.  Flat circle of granite the width of a finger. Then he went back into the dark, and came back carrying three clay jars. He set these down next to the granite panel. In each jar was a black paint.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want you to use these to paint a picture.\u8221\'94}

Remember, don\u8217\'92t privilege yourself. Don\u8217\'92t think about what should or shouldn\u8217\'92t be. You need to simply, start.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You want me to figure things out as I go?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t want you figure anything out. You are merely a tool. True art creates itself. It is reckoned with on its own terms. It is its own experience. It communicates nothing but what it is. You kneel here\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94 Salavan rubbed the floor in front of Mandri with his foot. \u8220\'93And you become the tool by which the work creates itself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri gets frustrated.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Paints. Screaming. Burgeonsight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looks unenthused.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come now. Think of all the times you\u8217\'92ve worked on a painting and, without any effort, without a single conscious thought, you discovered solutions to the questions of what color goes where. You did not discover them, those solutions revealed themselves to you. Now paint.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri figured he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t getting out unless he complied.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Salavan used his great strength to wrestle Mandrameen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s flailing limbs into submission, and used his weight to squeeze the air from Mandrameen\u8217\'92s lungs. He delighted in the pitiful sound that Mandrameen made as he wheezed. }
