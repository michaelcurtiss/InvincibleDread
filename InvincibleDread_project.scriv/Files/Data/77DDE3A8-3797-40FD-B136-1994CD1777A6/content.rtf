\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen despised the word.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Who isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t an artist?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A dancer, a poet, these are artists, yes, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s reasonable to say, but a hole-digger? He can be an artist too if he digs holes in a way that\u8217\'92s true to himself. Give a man shovel, a field of dirt, time to think about it, friends to impress, and likely as not he\u8217\'92ll have mounded up a penis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Is that art?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri thought so. If the triptych\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d nudes of Allasoreen were art, then that was art. Anyone can be an artist. A tax collector can be an artist if he\u8217\'92s sufficiently motivated to plumb the depths of greed. Mandri believed that all tax collectors were artists.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 true}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  artist, though, that is a distinction with walls, and it has almost nothing to do with what a person does\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 whether it be dancing, digging, or finessing balance sheets. Some true artists never do anything at all, yet true artists they remain because true artistry is a state of mind. To be sure, its not a noble one. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s about comic excess; too many big ideas, too many shallow excuses, and so exaggerated is the sense self that it becomes impossible to describe without resorting to sarcasm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 For example: Mandrameen was the humblest humble that ever humbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When asked what he did for a living, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d say, \u8220\'93Nothing important. I make things\u8221\'94, and then he\u8217\'92d add, \u8220\'93for whatever that is worth\u8221\'94. Then he\u8217\'92d strut around the grand Hrkan galleries and soon this charade of humility melted away because he could not hide his contempt for his contemporaries.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d stand in front of a painting and say, \u8220\'93This piece really moves me,\u8221\'94 and then he\u8217\'92d make a show of walking away. All must bear witness to his mop of black hair as it flounced itself in time with his skinny, stiff-backed step.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Or he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d say, \u8220\'93I weep at every stroke,\u8221\'94 and then he\u8217\'92s flash a knowing smile. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d say these things right to an artist\u8217\'92s face if he could get to it. He didn\u8217\'92t think of it as mean-spirited because artists, like himself, were safe targets for playful derision. Maybe they were the only safe targets, because it\u8217\'92s not really the person he was making fun of, it was their failed attempts to express themselves, and those are }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 completely}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  different things. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d never go after the person, no. Artists are the best people. It takes the best kind of person to put themselves in front of others and push through the barbs. It takes tough skin, unreasonable confidence, and a flair for the dramatic. Without any of that, an artist is doomed to live a life of sad obscurity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Now, none of that is necessarily true, but the truth of it doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t matter. The point is that Mandri believed\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in his bones if not his brain\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that true artists are all pricks, that they say prickish things, and that he was a true artist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He would to say to Vigram, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You haven\u8217\'92t the faintest idea of what you\u8217\'92re talking about.\u8221\'94 Vigram\u8217\'92s crime? He\u8217\'92d said that he liked a painting that he shouldn\u8217\'92t have. Vigram\u8217\'92s wealth be damned, Mandri\u8217\'92s knew what was good, what opinion was correct, and if he wasn\u8217\'92t correct in the literal, figurative, or spiritual sense, well, Vigram was certainly wrong as well. }
\par\pard\plain \tx0\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Old Vigram would argue the points but he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d always end up deferring to young Mandri. He was forced to defer because he himself was not an artist, not even the penis-in-the-field kind. He\u8217\'92d made his fortune as a creditor. Meanwhile Mandrameen, at the age of ten, could paint a portrait in oils that rivaled the old Jeketian masters.}
\par\pard\plain \tx0\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And these were real dynamic works, not polish-jobs where the paint is thin, the brush strokes invisible, and every hair is slavishly rendered into being like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d lost the plot of reality. When Mandrameen painted a portrait, he observed a tight economy of strokes. With a single stroke of color he could define the skin, the cheek, the skull underneath, the light, the shadow, and even the mood of the piece. One single stroke! He once painted a woman\u8217\'92s portrait using just twenty-four strokes\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 count them,}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1  twenty-four\hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1 }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 and it was a true, vivid likeness. There were few extra nibbles here and there to make the eyes glisten and the cleavage heave, but those hardly counted. Nobody noticed them. It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t stop Vigram from marveling at how young Mandri packed so much information into so few slaps of pigment. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram told Mandri that they were the marks of genius.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He paid Mandri for lessons. This was something of a charity, for Mandri was now twenty and inexplicably poor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 These lessons were given in Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s countryside villa, a good ways away from the must and crust of Meskalim. The day started with breakfast, where Vigram, a burly old man with a bald head and brown belly-beard that he kept oiled, curled, and trimmed, would push Mandri to explain why he hadn\u8217\'92t achieved success. Each week he\u8217\'92d put the question in a different way, but it was always about that basic thing: why wasn\u8217\'92t Mandri swimming in money.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri would explain that financial success, when it comes to art, has little to do with skill or quality. Novelty plays a role, but mostly it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s about preening tongues and critic\u8217\'92s pens. It\u8217\'92s about how many people know the raw fact of your existence. Vigram always pushed back, and Mandri always settled the matter . Today it was, \u8220\'93No. I refuse to debase myself by doing what it takes to succeed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram would then regale Mandri with the story of his own life, and he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d tell it in a way so as to suggest that accumulating wealth was the easiest thing in the world and that Mandri could do it too. Vigram told the story so many times that Mandri could tell it right back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 First, inherit four ounces of silver. Then, loan those four ounces to two brothers who run a bakery. Make sure its a bakery that supplies a Solitant temple with bread\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a surefire bet because temples are always the last thing to be put to the torch in lean times. The temple and the bakery brothers might accuse you of committing usury against Solraheen Himself, because you are, but if you get together with a priest and pray about it around a jug of beer and a pile of silver, the bleary shine will blind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 After that, lend smaller amounts over shorter terms to farmers who need emergency loans to pay their taxes after droughts or infestations. Split these debts up and sell them off in Meskalim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s budding bond market. There\u8217\'92s not much money in Meskalim itself, but it\u8217\'92s got a busy port and that means access to all the important markets of the Hrkan world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 From there, its a simple matter of sprouting six more eyes, four more limbs, and now that you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re a human spider you\u8217\'92ll be able to spin a web of silver that stretches into every corner of the continent. People will walk right into the debt. The wiggling only sticks them snug. You pick out the salvageable ones for your own use, and now you\u8217\'92ve got a little brood of spiders pouring over lists of sums credited and debts owed, and as long as you maintain a layer of abstraction between these creatures and your muscle, it\u8217\'92s all self-sustaining. And that\u8217\'92s it. Now you have a comfortable life and idle hours to spend however you want.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No debasement necessary,\u8221\'94 said Vigram, \u8220\'93You see, you know about all about art, but I know all about money. And that\u8217\'92s why I respect you so much, Mandri, you keep them separate.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In between bites of peached chicken potstickers, Mandri meekly agreed. He would have told Vigram what he really thought, but he really, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 really}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , needed the money.}
\par\pard\plain \tx0\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram clapped his hands and a serving girl came in and took their empty plates, then the pair headed out to Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s vine trellised, red-brick patio, and Vigram set himself to work in setting up an easel which he\u8217\'92d built himself. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you sure you want to do this }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 here}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 .\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not?\u8221\'94 asked Vigram. \u8220\'93Is there something wrong?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. There\u8217\'92s nothing }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 wrong}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , exactly. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s that this light is going to make things so much more difficult.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The trellis roof was absolutely crawling with vines, and that meant a richly dappled light would fall upon the sitter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram needed this explained.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The sun moves, these shadows will move\u8230\'85it\u8217\'92s a whole other thing to worry about. It\u8217\'92s easier to learn one thing at a time. It\u8217\'92ll be easier if we keep to simple, clean light, that way there\u8217\'92s no leafy shadows drifting across the face when you\u8217\'92re trying to figure out which eye goes where.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram shook his head, and that sent his great brown beard wiggling as if it were alive. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My dear Mandri, the patterns of light and shadow are a magical vesture.\u8221\'94}
\par\pard\plain \tx0\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see. Well you can worry about \u8216\'91magical vestures\u8217\'92 when you\u8217\'92re good.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Vigram. \u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t have it any other way. A magical vesture for a magical subject.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As if bidden from the, Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s daughter, Ora, joined them on the patio. She was Vigram\u8217\'92s favorite subject, Mandri\u8217\'92s age, the only one of his five children willing to sit for him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Isn\u8217\'92t she a subject fit for holy oils?\u8221\'94 asked Vigram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Undoubtedly,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes flicked to Ora without intention, but Vigram interpreted it, as he always did, as the most rabid of intentions, and the old man\u8217\'92s eyes squeezed out a suggestive smile, as if to give his patriarchal blessing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ora was good natured, comely, with clear brown skin and sun-kissed cheeks. She was also a belly roll away from mixing in with the oxen. Many a young man would leap at the chance to be with a fertility goddess, but Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to have children. But oh, her eyes. Impossible not to flirt with those sparkling umber eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Help her up,\u8221\'94 Vigram commanded. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll ready the canvas and palette.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri did as he was told and helped Ora up onto a high-legged stool. Ora let her fingers linger on his arm, and then Vigram barked at Mandri to get out of the way and stop distracting his muse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Again, Mandri did as he was told and took up his post behind the old man.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram picked up a stick of soft charcoal. He put down his first exploratory marks. This was always always the most difficult phase. Every work of art has to be built on a firm foundation. Get it wrong and everything that comes after will be wrong too. Unfortunately for Vigram, he had that all-too-common beginner\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s habit of refusing to use his god-damned brain. He started drawing wherever his hand randomly landed and what happened next was up to Solraheen. The end result was that Ora\u8217\'92s head was, somehow, too small. It was also too left-of-center. There\u8217\'92d be an awkward expanse behind her flower-studded curls.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hold on,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re moving too fast. Don\u8217\'92t think of this as a portrait\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 not yet. All we have right now is an oval, a rectangular canvas, and where that oval sits on the canvas. All you\u8217\'92re doing is putting an oval on the canvas.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So think about where\u8217\'92s the best place to put that oval. Make use of the whole canvas.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, yes you\u8217\'92re right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram rubbed the marks away with his palm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stepped back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He studied Ora.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stepped again to the canvas.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then he scratched a black oval right back where it had been.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that better?\u8221\'94 he asked without a hint of awareness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It needs to be a little bigger, I think.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram drew the oval again, but only slightly larger. It was still a good ways off from where it needed to be.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri encouraged the old man to continue, and from then on, almost every mark Vigram made was accompanied by a look back to Mandri for reassurance. Mandri eventually tired of this and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t look at me, look at her.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But I need to know if it\u8217\'92s right or wrong.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Assume that it\u8217\'92s always wrong, and then try to figure out why it\u8217\'92s wrong, and then fix it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was a glimmer of understanding in Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eye, but as soon as it came it faded. He twirled his beard in between his fat fingers, and then asked, \u8220\'93If the mark I make is always wrong, then how could I ever move past it? I\u8217\'92ll be redrawing the same line over and over again.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You move on when you want to move on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want to move on. I\u8217\'92m here to paint, not draw.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Finish\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 finish the basic shapes, at least.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This vigram did with a few swipes. He looked to Mandri for final approval.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s your paint,\u8221\'94 Mandri said with a passive shrug. \u8220\'93But you }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 need}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to understand the importance of the drawing.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do understand. You talk about it all the time. I just can\u8217\'92t do it.\u8221\'94 Vigram tossed his charcoal over his shoulder and squealed with delight as he picked up his favorite brush.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri watched on in confusion as Vigram threw down the first splotches of color in a flurry. The man was building was an affront to the senses, and Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t look away because he was getting paid to witness it. His world was forcibly narrowed to the canvas, which was hideous, Vigram, who was clueless, and Ora, who was eying Mandri up like he was her next meal. Mandri tried to avoid her at all costs, but he couldn\u8217\'92t help it; she was the sitter, the subject, and his eyes would instinctively wander over her, and whenever they did, her smile would perk up. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, stop flirting with my daughter.\u8221\'94 Vigram hid himself behind the canvas and gave Mandri another encouraging smile. This time his eyebrows jumped to emphasize the point.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not. I\u8217\'92m checking proportions.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If that\u8217\'92s what you\u8217\'92re doing, then tell me what you think.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri took pause to search for the right words to say. He knew what was wrong with the piece\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he could write a treatise on ethics. He also knew that Vigram wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be able to handle an unvarnished critique. Almost no one can. The man might get upset, and then there\u8217\'92d be no more money. So, Mandri went against his own nature and exercised restraint. He knew he had to do what everyone else does and start off with a disarming compliment. The problem was that there was literally nothing good about this work in progress.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s good,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He sat back in his hip, crossed his arms, and let his eyes race around the painting. He made every honest effort to take in the observations that Vigram was putting down. Unfortunately, Vigram had that other beginner\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s habit of mixing colors on the canvas in an effort to undo mistakes\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that can be done, but its dangerous. Oils dry too slow to mess around. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Vigram\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know, I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m gonna say it anyways. You need to get the color correct on the palette before it touches the canvas. That\u8217\'92s what the pallette is there for.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram nodded, then began his work again in earnest. Mandri watched as the old man mixed a bluish shade of bronze for Ora\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chin. Unless there was some extraordinary circumstances of light and shadow\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 which there weren\u8217\'92t\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was a color meant for the chin a man who keeps a close shave. Vigram slapped it down over his charcoal guidelines, then his eyes darted between his daughter and the painting, back and forth, back and forth, and then his lips curled into a frown and he muttered, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not quite right.\u8221\'94 He gave Mandri a sheepish grin, then he stabbed his brush into a slug of white, and he rubbed it into the manly chin. That wasn\u8217\'92t quite right either. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This would go on into infinity if Mandri did put a stop to it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not bad,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The charcoal lines looked like they were bleeding pus.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One of those leafy shadows had drifted over Ora\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left eye, and Vigram had a go at it. The end result looked more like an bandit\u8217\'92s eye-patch than a beauty veiled. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s good,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93No really, I mean it. It\u8217\'92s not a masterpiece, but it\u8217\'92s\u8230\'85 it\u8217\'92s on the path.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s on }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 a}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  path, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s for sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri tapped his bottom lip as Vigram stepped aside to let him fully into the work.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you remember what I said last week?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You said that I need to learn to draw hands.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And have you done that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nope!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram laughed at his own impertinence. He hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even tried to draw Ora\u8217\'92s fingers. They were chicken scratches.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you aren\u8217\'92t going take what I say to heart, then what\u8217\'92s the point of me coming here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry, Mandri, but hands are too hard to paint. If a hand had one or two fingers it\u8217\'92d be a different matter entirely. As it is, they\u8217\'92re difficult things to draw.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, you can think of it as having three fingers. The middle two share a tendon so they tend to move together.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But then there\u8217\'92s the thumb.\u8221\'94 Vigram shook his head. \u8220\'93The whole thing is just too much.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you truly want to get better, you have to try, and trying means putting in the time and effort to learn how to draw hands.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only things that matter are the face and the hands. You could give Ora forty ribs and a single breast and people will forgive you for it, so long as you\u8217\'92ve drawn a perfect face and delicate, expressive, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 anatomically correct}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  hands.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll do better with the hands.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You say that, but I feel like next time I come over you won\u8217\'92t have drawn a single hand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Probably.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram laughed again and Mandri rubbed his frustrated brow. This whole ordeal was a waste of time. If didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t need that money so damned bad, he\u8217\'92d have quit the first week.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His little reverie was interrupted when one of Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s men marched into the patio. The man was a soldier with a puffed up chest, high boots, a white plaited skirt, and a long, knobbly spear\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a poor imitation of professional Hrkan soldier, though he did have the squarest chins that Mandri had ever seen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier stomped his foot and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sorry to interrupt.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is it?\u8221\'94 Vigram asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The young master\u8217\'92s ox is eating the apples.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier pointed an accusing finger to the hill beyond the trellis. All eyes peered through the vines, where some twenty meters away was Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s only possession: a yellow ox named Gil. Gil was was craning his head up high to reach a sweet red apple. His long pink tongue was stuck out and twirling, trying in vain to lick the apple off its stem but the fruit was little too high up. All Gil\u8217\'92s tongue was doing was batting the ripened fruit around in circles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram turned to Mandri, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you insist on bringing that ox along?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gil has a right to go where he wants,\u8221\'94 Mandri said firmly. \u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s as much a human being as you or I.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hah!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s true. Watch\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Mandri turned to Gil and shouted, \u8220\'93Gil! Gil, C\u8217\'92mere!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gil\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ears swiveled at the mention of his name, and the rest of his head slowly followed. He stared back through the vines with that dumb, bovine ogle. Slobber dripped unheeded from his lower lip. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gil!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gil blinked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then he got distracted by the healthy grass below him. He bit off a mouthful and started to chew.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gil! Hup!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gil looked up again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His protuberant eyes seemed stare }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A second later, and he was trotting towards the patio, dewflap flapping as his short-hair hide rolled back and forth over his sagging, aged spine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Poor old creature,\u8221\'94 Vigram muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah, he\u8217\'92s fine,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gill clopped into the patio as if it were his living room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ora slid off her chair and hurried behind Mandri and Vigram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier lowered his spear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Woah, woah, woah!\u8221\'94 Mandri exclaimed as he pushed the spearhead away. \u8220\'93That is not necessary.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram nodded to the soldier and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thank you, you\u8217\'92re dismissed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier spun on his heel, and Mandri stared daggers into his back as he left.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If he pricked Gil I\u8217\'92d have him up for attempted murder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gill nuzzled up against Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram eyed old Gil with disdain. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If Gil was eating my apples, I could have him up for thievery.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ridiculous,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93Gil\u8217\'92s the nicest old ox you\u8217\'92ll ever meet. Watch this,\u8221\'94 Mandri presented Vigram\u8217\'92s painting to Gil with a flourish, then asked his ox, \u8220\'93What do you think of Viggi\u8217\'92s painting?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gill looked at it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He gave his grass a chew.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then he mooed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See!?\u8221\'94 Mandri exclaimed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See what?\u8221\'94 Vigram asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He likes it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who\u8217\'92s ridiculous.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ora sauntered over to Gil and playfully scratched him into a cooing moo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s a sweet thing, isn\u8217\'92t he?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram said to Ora, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you think of my painting?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ora eyed the painting with suspicion, and that quickly morphed into a stifled laugh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not that bad, is it? Ora\u8230\'85It\u8217\'92s not that bad. Come now, I\u8217\'92ll have your honest opinion.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It looks like a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brow nit tight and studied the face he\u8217\'92d painted. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 that}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  grotesque.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe it\u8217\'92s the hands,\u8221\'94 said Oya. \u8220\'93They look like claws.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The mention of hands put Vigram into full retreat. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t paint hands!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ora laughed and prodded him on and simple, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m an old man! I don\u8217\'92t have the dexterity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The dexterity?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Painting hands is like doing needlework. Especially when I use this tiny brush. I don\u8217\'92t have the dexterity for it.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Excuse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ora batted her eyes at Mandri. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Artists needs strong and dexterous hands, don\u8217\'92t they?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face lit up like he\u8217\'92d just been punched in the gut. This was the most upfront a girl had ever been, right in front of her own father no less. Worse, the man was smiling like he was about to stamp a return on interest. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh\u8230\'85No\u8230\'85 well yes, but I don\u8217\'92t have any, uh, dexterity. I actually haven\u8217\'92t painted a portrait in more than two years.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nonsense!\u8221\'94 said Vigram. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen you paint.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Around you I\u8217\'92ve done a little bit for demonstration, but that doesn\u8217\'92t really count.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then what have you been doing up on that little farm of yours?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Farming.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram rolled his eyes. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at you,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve never farmed a day in your life. You know what?\u8221\'94 Vigram waved the out of the air with an open hand. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s time for lunch. I\u8217\'92ll come and get you two when it\u8217\'92s ready.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With that, he stomped his way into his villa\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s anteroom, leaving Mandri alone with Ora and Gil.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ora was leaning on Gil like he was hers already. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why don\u8217\'92t you paint anymore?\u8221\'94 she asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh\u8230\'85it would be too hard to explain.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Try.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri tried to think of a more palatable excuse, and he found it when he picked up Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wooden pallette. \u8220\'93You see, it\u8217\'92s expensive to paint. I don\u8217\'92t think it\u8217\'92s worth it. I mean look at all this pigment. The canvas. At this point in my life it\u8217\'92d take me a year to afford all this.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A dawning realization that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d stumbled into a trap.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that how he feels about it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, I\u8217\'92ve seen your farm. He\u8217\'92s seen your farm. Everybody\u8217\'92s seen your farm. It\u8217\'92s not a farm.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gil had already back up on the hill, licking at that apple.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was alone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl set her hands on her hips and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The girls in Meskalim all say that you\u8217\'92re a eunuch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An old woman came looking for you. She said you were a eunuch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Couldn\u8217\'92t have been looking for me, because I\u8217\'92m not a eunuch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Prove it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri almost dropped the paints onto the brick.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You want me to bare myself?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ora crossed her arms and gave Mandri an expectant look.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to pull my uglies out just to prove they\u8217\'92re there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re serious?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was too thin to absorb blunt shock of a woman. He scrunched up his face and tried to pretend like he had no idea what was going on, but Oya was a girl trained in the art of men. She saw right through it and made her move, grabbed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm and pulled him close to her. She caught his eyes and forced him to confront her lilac\u8217\'92d scent, her bounding heat, her smooth skin, her honeyed, aching smile.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ora\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a beautiful girl, but-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But what? You go in for men?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I could be good for you,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And what do you get out of it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She squeezed herself against him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could be good for me,\u8221\'94 she said. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You would not say that if you really knew me.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A wavering moment passed, and Mandri nearly broke. He probably would have too, if Gil hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t finally reached his apple and let out a triumphant bellow. It was so loud that it startled both Mandri and Oya out of their awkward embrace.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay. Oooookay,\u8221\'94 said Mandri as he fled across the patio.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wait, Mandri\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, that\u8217\'92s enough. I\u8217\'92m leaving.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is wrong with you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He did not answer. There was no point in answering. This was not what he was here for.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ran out of the patio, then stopped when he realized he was forgetting something.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gil!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gil was already trotting down villa\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gentle hill. Mandri waited up, and together they headed for Vigram\u8217\'92s swing gate, where they waited for Vigram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A moment later, and a sore Vigram was trotting down his thoroughfare. A good distance for an out of shape old man. He arrived at his gate out of breath.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What did you say to Ora?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothing. I just walked away.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You walked away?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look, Vigram, could I just get the money.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram reached into a fold in his robe and pulled out a small sack of coin. It was fatter than usual.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oya thinks you\u8217\'92re buying burgeons from Geem.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram looked down his nose at Mandri and scratched his beard. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m going to give you this money because I owe it. If I find out your using this for burgeons, don\u8217\'92t come back here. And for Sol\u8217\'92s sake, buy some apples for old Gil here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I will.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram put the coin back in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hand, and Mandri tucked it into his robe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve got the gift of the brush, Mandri. I\u8217\'92m serious. Solraheen\u8217\'92s given you a gift. It\u8217\'92s a sacred gift.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri and Gil walked out the gate. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m serious!\u8221\'94 said Vigram. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve been given a gift!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri waved back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a gift, not a special one, at least. He could paint a portrait in twenty-four strokes, but few would be impressed if they watched him do it. He would spend hours and hours making those single strokes. He\u8217\'92d put one down, and if it wasn\u8217\'92t }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 exactly}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  right, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d carefully wipe it away, then put it down again, and he\u8217\'92d repeat this for as long as it took. Days. A week. Longer. People only ever saw the finished product, those twenty-four strokes and they assumed that Mandri\u8217\'92s brush went slip-slap-boom and there\u8217\'92s a true likeness. That story couldn\u8217\'92t be further from the truth. Mandri\u8217\'92s real talent was his tolerance of tedium, and that\u8217\'92s a talent a person can lose; Mandri was living proof. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he and Gil got to the top of the big hill that overlooked Vigram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s villa, he took one last look back. Vigram was still standing in his drive. Vigram waved, and then he cupped his voice and shouted, \u8220\'93No burgeons, Mandri!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, yeah,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered under his breath.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Vigram shouted again. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92ll put out your spark!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t about to get into an argument at that kind of distance, so he waved back and then kept on walking all the way to Geem\u8217\'92s. There he bought half a bushel of burgeons, and Geem gave Gil half a melon, free of charge. They were Down-Valley burgeons, decent stuff but the the waxy capsule leaves were a bit too brittle so the insides had a tendency to dry out too quick for Mandri\u8217\'92s liking. But that was all Geem had so he bought them. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Mandri and Gil continued along the road, stomping their way through the muddy wheel-ruts, slapping away the flies, humming and mooing nursery rhymes until they made it back the farm where his parents were buried. }}
