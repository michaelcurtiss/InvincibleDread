Mandri used to paint pictures of great cormin lizards sprinting along the sand. These were real dynamic pieces that took forever to compose. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d pull out all the tricks but could never get beyond the mere suggestion of movement. Like, he wouldn\u8217\'92t paint the lizard mid-leap, because if he did that the lizard would, paradoxically, feel static. It would feel flat, like it was fly-swatted onto the canvas. Instead, he\u8217\'92d the lizard it right before it was about to jump. He\u8217\'92d try to capture that coiled energy rippling in the hind legs and tail. It was the suggestion of something about-to-happen. That was always more dramatic than something currently-happening. It still sucked compared to the real thing. It sucked compared to the fact that, when high, he could watch the salt that stained his field ooze up out the ground. Now that was fascinating. The salt had been working its way up into the soil since he bought the place.}
