\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Old Elrahet was the new pacesetter, and so their slow march into the evening was a welcome relief to Mandrameen. The canyon shadows grew black and the brilliant blue of the sky overhead dimmed into purpler hues. It was near the golden hour when the path led up a steep rise and emptied out onto the heights of the Goree plateau. Behind them was the bewildering maze of canyon cracks that stretched out for miles before fading into the dark rift of the Pass. In front of them was a structure that blurred the line between the work of Nature and the work of humanity, for at once it was both a building and a mountain, at once a fat, flat-topped spire of stone and a temple whose walls were embossed with geometric patterns composed of simple shapes; circles, diamonds, squares, and triangles, and these shapes came together to roughly resemble faces. Animal faces, demonic faces, faces inside of faces. An oval the size of four-floor building demarcated the edges of a fox\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gape, and the nostrils of the fox were the eyes of a crow, and the beak of the crow was the nose of a snarling demon. These designs wrapped around the lower floors, though these were still high up, for the temple sat on top of a sloping hill of rock rubble, rubble laid down by both the right and left despoiling hands: time and humanity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This was Shulgi, the sanctuary of the Greskalun, and Mandri had never seen its like in a painting. All the monumental wonders of humanity get their place in Hrkan art, and so by rights Shulgi should have been included. The Hrkan brush is especially attracted to the monuments of the outland tribes, for the glories of the conquered can only heighten the glory of the Hrkan conqueror. This temple would have been one of the brightest jewels in the crown of crowns, and that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s even after accounting for the effects of the bewitching evening sun whose amber rays made the structure seem to burst in flame.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The lack of its account in Hrkan art could only be explained by ignorance. The Hrkan Lords did not know of it. If they did, they would have swept away the Greskalun a long time ago, and if they learned of it now, they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have a much easier time of it because the building was an empty husk. Above the graven faces on the temple\u8217\'92s wall were rows of mullioned arch windows, each as black and empty of candlelight as the last. If this were a living temple, there would be light, there would be movement, there would be voices chanting Old Jandri hymns with all the guttural intensity of a lizard litter that\u8217\'92s been brushed with the scent of a female. But the air was silent save for the whistling wind. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto jogged past Mandri to take up his rightful place at the head of the Ayramless column. Then he led them all up the well-trodden slope to the foot of a long flight of stairs that led to the temple entrance. And these were troublesome stairs, steep, at least a hundred of them, and every step had to be dealt with on its own terms, for every step had it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s own unique slump from the wear of ages. They looked more like layers of melted wax than stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Three steps up and Mandri noticed a dark stain climbing up the stairs with him as he went. He supposed that up above, some unattended bucket of oil had spilled, found a groove, and then streamed all the way down to the bottom. If it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t oil, well, it could be a number of other substances. Perfumant wine. Red berry brine. Ink. It could be slurried excrement; a temple that large had to have drainage somewhere. Odd that they\u8217\'92d have it running out the front door. It could also be blood. Out of these possible explanations, blood had the most explanatory power. It explained the stain, and it explained the general unease creeping under skin. It explained why he felt fear when he looked up at the black, yawning mouth that was Shulgi\u8217\'92s entrance, an entrance true to all senses of the word. It was sculpted, using the language of clean geometric, into the stylized head of a viper. When Mandri that this dark stain of his fascination was staining the viper\u8217\'92s gums.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto stopped before entering. He drew his sword as if he were about to do battle with the building itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93Everyone turn back around\u8230\'85 We\u8217\'92ll wait for Ayram somewhere else.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet scoffed at the suggestion, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going back down,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93I climbed up these steps and I\u8217\'92ll be damned if I don\u8217\'92t stick my head in and see what\u8217\'92s happened.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Moto firmly. \u8220\'93Ayram said that we should only wait inside the temple if it was empty.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Someone get a torch going,\u8221\'94 Elrahet grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah was a step ahead of her, already striking sparks of flint onto a bundle of torch sticks that Purl was holding. The dried resin caught flame quickly, and soon it was burning brightly, sending a thick cloud of black smoke swirling into the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto yanked the torch out of Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hands.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ayram put me in charge,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet bowed and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then take charge of your wits and march yourself inside.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto stared down elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Or,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet, \u8220\'93you can run away and explain to Ayram why you left his witch all alone.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The anger.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay. But if I want to I\u8217\'92m going }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And he thrust the torch into the temple interior. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As soon he did, a swarm of bats screeched in the darkness and took flight. Their wingbeats battered the torchsmoke as they swirled out of the viper\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mouth, and flew over everyone\u8217\'92s heads.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I told you it wasn\u8217\'92t empty,\u8221\'94 Moto said as he watched the bats swerve along the temple wall and then disappear back into some unseen hole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet snarled and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Aren\u8217\'92t you a little big to be scared of a few bats?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s more than bats in there and you know it,\u8221\'94 Moto declared. \u8220\'93It smells too foul to be empty.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 said Purl. \u8220\'93It smells like stale piss.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All piss smells stale,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I suppose you would know,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get a move on,\u8221\'94 Elrahet grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto held his torch aloft and stepped into the temple. Everyone filtered in behind. Mandri was last to enter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Shulgi\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s entrance hall was a grand, colonnaded affair, as wide as a barge, and thrice as long as wide. The torchlight could only tease the distant darkness. In the middle of this dimness, dugout of the floor, was a large octagonal fire pit that filled almost to the brim with white ash. Wind and time had swept some of this ash around the room, trails of it . Frost., painting especially a cross-legged figure sitting on the opposite side.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto waved his torch back and forth. He shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hello there,\u8221\'94 but his words echoed harmlessly around the room. The figure, robed in green, was sitting cross-legged, slumped, chin-tucked as if sleeping. The only bit of visible flesh was a bald head, almost as pale as Obo\u8217\'92s.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Probably dead,\u8221\'94 marked Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, you think so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re the one that said \u8216\'91hello\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can I have the torch, please.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto handed the torch to Elrahet, and she walked towards the mysterious figure, but stopped suddenly when she heard the crunch of bone under her shoe. She stepped aside, to reveal the crushed spine of a small creature.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He must\u8217\'92ve been eating mice,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Or the bats,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Now that Mandri knew they were there, he was noticing the scattered remains of small creatures all over the place. Thin bones of lizard legs, bats, foxes, mice, even the shells of beetles. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet broke the stunned silence when she waddled up to that figure by the pile of ash and poked him hard with her staff.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man fell onto his side, the thudding impact kicking up a puff of ash.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is indeed dead,\u8221\'94 Elrahet declared. \u8220\'93And he is a man, but only just.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She bent down and rubbed the dead man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robe in between her fingers. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Viggy wool,\u8221\'94 she said confidently. \u8220\'93This is the raiment of Greskal\u8217\'92s prince. Is that what we have here, do you think? Is this young Greskaleen, or a scrounger with a stolen robe?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s inquisitive demeanor gave Mandri the courage to carry himself into the room. His feet were glad to be on smooth, flat stone, and he was glad to be \u8216\'91inside\u8217\'92\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that was a distinction that he forgot existed after spending so long wandering in the wilderness. So what if there were bats and a dead body? Bats were fine, and dead was dead. Aside from the Ayramun, Mandri thought he had nothing worry about. And despite the unnerving sound of little animal bones crunching under his feet, a strange calm washed over him. but then he noticed, out of the corner of his eye, a faint glimmer. There at the back of the entrance hall, shining faintly in the torch\u8217\'92s dancing light, was an enormous golden statue of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As far as statues of the Most Favored go, this one was a common Old Jandri design, called the closet style, where Solraheen is shown sitting so as to mark the place as His dwelling. His golden skin is smooth and his body featureless. His face is round, alive, and enlightened. His pose is rigid as a board, as if someone who had never sat before had the act described to them and they made this image. The Hrks would later give Solraheen the muscles of a hero and the natural bearing of a Hrkan Lord being crowned, but Mandri preferred this older style. It was less tied to . More primitive. And it was huge, at least twenty feet tall. Where most closet Solraheens were inset into a wall or ensconced within a wooden, this Solraheen sat out in the open, and his seat was a bronze throne pillowed with opalescent lizard hides that had been polished to a sheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a beautiful sight. No doubt the source of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s newfound serenity. Though none of it glittered as brightly as Mandrameen might have expected. A thin layer of dust dulled its luster, and some of that fire-lorn ash had speckled His cheek. While all that was a shame, it could be forgiven because there was no one to attend to him . What could not be forgiven was the fact that, instead of a clean and warm amber glow, Solraheen\u8217\'92s golden skin shone was darkly mottled. Tarnished.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri winced at the iniquity. Pure gold cannot tarnish. This meant that the Greskalun had polluted His flesh with impure metals. No wonder Solraheen did not deliver them from their suffering. And worse: standing by Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left foot were two long-necked shooki jugs\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 jugs of urine. Now, he could not say for certain what this urine was for, but there was a narrative proximity here which couldn\u8217\'92t be ignored. Surely\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 surely the Greskalun were bathing their God in their own piss to try and scrub away the tarnish.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One indignity to wash away another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They should have settled for a smaller statue,\u8221\'94 Mandri mumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94 croaked Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri pointed to the statue. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s tarnished,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What of it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s sacrilegious\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hornswoggle. The good Lord doesn\u8217\'92t care about gold. Well, he does, but not in the way in which you think. What He really cares about is this man here,\u8221\'94 she poked the dead man again with her cane, \u8220\'93And that poor thing there.\u8221\'94 She pointed with the torch to a dark lump sitting not ten feet away from Mandri. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All the Ayramun looked on in earnest at whatever it was Elrahet was pointing at. Purl was the first to realize what it was and gasped. Mandri was the second. Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shock helped him to realize that the protuberance on top of this shadowy lump was an ear. The rest was a mop of dark hair and the back of a neck, albeit a shredded one, with a few links of its vertebral column still attached.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazyd was right,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said. \u8220\'93Though it wasn\u8217\'92t pure hunger which urged this tasting of flesh.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri . He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you saying that this green robe guy }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 ate}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  that other guy over there?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet nodded. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was his final meal.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This place is cursed,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Cursed!?\u8221\'94 exclaimed Elrahet. \u8220\'93Nonsense. This man was one of Solraheen\u8217\'92s champions.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How could you say that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t be so quick to judge those touched by the darkness. There is no greater struggle. And this brave soul was victorious. He fought against the rising tide and cut out his own stomach before it took him completely. See here\u8230\'85 he was growing horns.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She turned the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chin upright with the tip of her cane, and sure enough, there were two fleshy nubs protruding from his forehead. His jaw lolled open, and a long, forked tongue unfurled onto the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If he had lost his battle, this world\u8217\'92s woes would be magnified by a hundred thousand thousand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She held the torch low to the slumped form of the green-robed man. On the ground in front of him, half buried in ash, was a round stomach that was so inflated with that final meal that it seemed close to bursting. It was still attached to man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s intestines, and  and that it resembled a  was as nearly. Not to mention that it was nearly as black as fabled black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Divination is not a subtle art. a stomach is upon a stomach there are lines blotches diseases and it's a thing that every human being has an eye for. it did not take one so learned as El rehet to see that this dead man's stomach portended Doom.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alllllright,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re not waiting in here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 We'll wait here until iron finds us}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto's face scrunched up in Tower disappointment. he He's Shrugged and clapped his hands to show that El rehet had relieved him of responsibility. if something went wrong he'd not be blamed for it he said it's packed down pulled from it of rock crystal lens and made it known that he was going to go look for Ira and he dumped out the door.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Elder had called after him don't go too far. Moto said I'm just looking why I've got this}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Landry strayed by the Green robed Man and watched El rehet fiddle with the black stomach the site filled him with such unease that he decided he better he'd have more fun standing outside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He he joined Moto and Pearl out on the temples High doorstep.  Moto for a while and when he was finished Pearl asked to turn. the sky was fading Into night in the Stars where revealing themselves.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  I see him said Pearl}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  let me see said Moto and as he was want to do he yanked the lens from Pearl's grip mandry peered in the general direction of where Pearl was pointing but he saw no  movement}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  he's running fast said Moto }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Trying to lay a false Trail said Pearl}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  I don't think so said Moto  If I Didn't Know Better I'd say he's  spooked}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What makes you say you know better ask mandry}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  because it's Ayram the man doesn't get spooked}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  mandry sees Ayram running. Caught him just in time to see the Giant jump not climb but jump down into a crevasse and just as he did a meme of Sunfire exploded out from the south and fried the air rushing in to fill Island's absent frame}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  oh s*** exclaimed Moto get inside quick }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandry didn't need encouragement though it took an arm Under pearls shoulder to get her to go inside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  the three of them tumbled into the entrance hall and L Rahat regarded them with some consternation}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  there's a method out there, Moto explained it's chasing iron through a cracks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone grab your things we need to be ready to run}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  hell we should start running right now Ayram will catch up}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They run through the Halls.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Wait where are we going?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  follow me said El rehet.  Bend time remembering which way to go.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Eventually  footsteps behind mandry he drew his sword and out of the darkness I am leaped frightening him have to death pictures scared me}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 We have some time I set a false Trail}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You can't set a false Trail for a mazd.}
