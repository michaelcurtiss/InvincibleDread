\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The hours before an ambush were unbearable for Seb. Giddy anticipation always came to him too early, and this turned into an angry impatience when time dragged on. He knew this was all a symptom of elevated expectations, but he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t help it, the future was coming, and it came with a certain surprise\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 death or glory.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 By Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s logic, an ambush was always more of a surprise for him than it was for the poor sods he was ambushing because he had been thinking about the moment for days. His expectations were so built up that they\u8217\'92d become a solid edifice of dread. When the moment finally came and things played out differently\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and they always did\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the exhilaration of finding himself still alive was overwhelming. Meanwhile, a traveler in the Sand, especially a Hrkan traveler, they\u8217\'92re always expecting to encounter some gang of hard-up outland folk, so it\u8217\'92s no real surprise when outland folk materialize out of a dark valley shadow. To add to that, being surprised at being ambushed is necessarily a short-lived surprise. Sometimes it was permanent if an arrow implanted itself in the forehead, as that tends to fix the face into a look of permanent surprise. Semi-permanent, actually, because eventually the lizards will stroll in and strip the flesh from the skull and that look of surprise disappears into their bellies, then gets excreted out as that white uric acid.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This Junei ambush was different because the ambushee had a fighting chance. Seb was filled with dread before an ambush with the surest odds, so this one was killing him. The plan to take out the Mazyd and his Minder had to play out exactly as expected, or all the Ayramun would be killed. A Mazyd Lord could wipe out an entire army by himself. Even with him taken care of, there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be the fifty-to-eighty men of unknown prowess that needed killing. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Fifty-to-eighty.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Maybe ninety.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There were only thirty Ayramun with fifteen arrows each. Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rule of thumb was that arrows go roughly five-to-one, misses to hits\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 depending, of course, on the skill of the archer. He didn\u8217\'92t have an aptitude for numbers, but it seemed like there weren\u8217\'92t enough arrows. It would be close, and close was dangerous.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He knew he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the only wracked with anxiety because of the rest of the Ayramun were quiet as the mute. The three lizard brothers never stopped joking around, and even they were quiet. Ambushes usually weren\u8217\'92t an exception for them. A gold caravan could be passing right by and they\u8217\'92d find humor in risking everyone\u8217\'92s discovery by tumbling a stone down a rocky slope, or blundering a fart and then claiming later that they couldn\u8217\'92t have helped it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 even they were keeping low and moving slow, naught but skinny shadows being whipped along by Moto\u8217\'92s whistled calls. They behaved because the rumor was that a Mazyd\u8217\'92s eyesight was nearly as good as Moto\u8217\'92s rock crystal lenses, and a Mazyd\u8217\'92s ears were as good as a spade-eared bat. That caravan was close enough now that if a Mazyd truly was in their midst, then his superfine perception was something to worry about. Seb knew that they were close enough because he sneaked a peek over the lip of a ravine and could pick out the brownish speck of that caravan against the white of the Junei plain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A whispered shout from behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He flashed an irate at Seb, and Seb hissed like a lizard caught unawares, then reluctantly ducked down into the ravine. Moto was the only one allowed to peek over the hills and down into the plain. He was the only one allowed because he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d said he was the only one allowed. Seb , then joined the rest of the Ayramun as they weaved their own trails towards hiding places that they\u8217\'92d scouted out before hand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a decent ravine, long and steep-sided. It bowed to the left, which was good, because it meant that Seb could loose his arrows from safe behind the bend. The arrows would go up and over and he could rapid fire without any fear of being spotted. Still, he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t think it was as good as springing the ambush in the Junei Pass proper, like they usually did. Moto insisted on doing it out in the hills because he said that everyone expects to be ambushed inside a bottlenecked pass, and since the plan to take down the Mazyd hinged on the element of surprise, the best thing to do was to mirror the caravan as they made their way across the plain, then meet them in the hills and attack while their eyes were set on the dark and ominous gap in the mountains that was the Junei Pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t like the logic. People worried about ambushes in bottlenecks because bottlenecks were the best place to ambush. A ravine was no true bottleneck. Compared to the vast expanse of the Junei plain, sure, it would do, but the slopes were nowhere near the height or steepness of a mountain shelf. The Hrks could just scramble up those ravine slopes and escape. It\u8217\'92d happened before. It was like kicking off the top of an ant hill\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 all of a sudden it\u8217\'92s a free-for-all in all directions. In the panicked confusion some poor gits would run right up to Seb\u8217\'92s own hiding spot. Most times that was fine, he\u8217\'92d pop out and gut them, but if that certain someone was a Hrkan skila, then close quarters with his prey was the last place Seb wanted to be.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All this stress was made worse by the look on Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face. The man was peering through his lenses, and his squinting eye was so bugged out that he looked like he seen straight through the stomach of Solraheen. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was close enough to him to hear him whisper, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Young Papi, a scrawny, short, and excitable lad with a bucktoothed, ratty face, was squatting nearby behind a stone. He heard Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s adumbration too, and he asked the man, \u8220\'93What is it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re headed for a different route.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94 Papi squeaked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We need to move.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re not coming through here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto ducked down from the lip of the ravine and tucked his lenses back in their bag and pocketed it. He sat for a moment, elbows on knees, a perfect picture of contemplation, then said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They were going to come through here, but now they\u8217\'92re not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They changed directions?\u8221\'94. Papi\u8217\'92s eyes were wide as the moon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t answer. He was back to brooding.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Papi said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If they changed direction, then you think they know we\u8217\'92re here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We need to move,\u8221\'94 Moto said again. \u8220\'93We need to hop over a few hills.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Skinny Dill\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bald, blue-eyed, jug-eared head popped out from behind a boulder to share his opinion on the matter. \u8220\'93We can\u8217\'92t move now!\u8221\'94, he said. \u8220\'93The Mazyd will see us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We can move if we\u8217\'92re careful,\u8221\'94 was Moto\u8217\'92s retort. He gestured behind him, , and said, \u8220\'93The caravan is still a ways out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Dill\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s upper lip curled into a skeptical scoff. He said, sharply, \u8220\'93If you can see the Mazyd, the Mazyd can see you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Papi\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s said, \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ve should wait for Elrahet\u8217\'92s smoke.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The rest of the thirty Ayramun were scattered about on either side of the ravine, and every single one of them were staring up at Moto. Moto was doing a decent job feigning calm, but Papi and Dill\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pained expressions told everyone everything they needed to know. A swell of anxiety washed through the ravine, bringing whispers and . Moto picked up his unstrung recurve bow and made to crawl up over the ravine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Papi\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 Seb called after him. \u8220\'93We wait for the fog to move.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Damn waiting for that old woman!\u8221\'94 Moto blurted out. \u8220\'93If her shits not here by now, it\u8217\'92s not coming. We need to move.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about Ayram?\u8221\'94 Papi asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah,\u8221\'94 said Dill. \u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s Ayram?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let Ayram worry about Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb whistled to grab everyone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s attention. Once their gazes were in hand, Seb pointed up to the Hias mountains behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There, drifting out of the dark belly of the Junei Pass, was a grey, wispy mist. It was hardly noticeable, but all the same it was there, and it was moving fast down into the hills, growing thicker by the moment. Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s magic was working.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The snooty look in Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes evaporated. He beckoned Seb over, and Seb scurried up. Moto said to him, \u8220\'93The fog is going to make it hard to mirror that caravan. I\u8217\'92m going to get down to the plain to make sure I know exactly which path they\u8217\'92re headed for. I\u8217\'92m putting you in charge until I get back.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb nodded, but Dill overheard and was less enthused. He left his boulder and squat-walked over, then said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t do that. Only Ayram can put someone in charge.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t care who\u8217\'92s in charge,\u8221\'94 Moto said scornfully. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t move from this ravine. Don\u8217\'92t even think about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t anything in Moto\u8217\'92s words for Dill to argue with, though the wild look in Dill\u8217\'92s eyes and the spidering veins on the sides of shaven head said he didn\u8217\'92t appreciate the tone. Dill was a man who was always defending his place in the pecking order. The list of men who could give him short shrift was a short list: Ayram, and then barely Moto. No women. Moteah could probably take him, but Seb was sure that Dill had never countenanced the thought. He was certainly nowhere near a match for Moto, but Dill always had that wild look in his eyes, the same look Seb got when he got to thinking about serving Moto his comeuppance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was blissfully immune to it all. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t care that Gil was shooting him the evil eye. He scuttled down the ravine bank, and at the bottom he dusted off the ass-chaps of his orange robe, did a glancing head-count to make sure all the Ayramun were paying attention, and then he broke his own enforced silence by saying, \u8220\'93My fellow foolhards\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 sit tight, I\u8217\'92ll be back soon.\u8221\'94 He turned around and ran north around the bend and towards the plain. He was gone in less time than it took Seb to fish another borcandi spine out of his sleeve. Seb was chewing through his spines at a prodigious rate, such was the stress. It was never good for discipline when a leader leaves the group, even a much-begrudged deputy leader like Moto. Without a man up top, Seb knew it was only a matter of time before someone got a bright idea that needed taming. Seb figured Dill would be the first to act up, because when Dill rambled back over to his boulder he was muttering insults and curses at no one in particular.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Loosen up, Dill\u8221\'94, said Forty. Forty was an older woman with a rascal\u8217\'92s disposition. She playfully twanged her bow at Dill; a mocking shot at his self-importance. Dill sized up this affront with a puffed-up chest, and said, \u8220\'93Big show for a small woman. Better be careful, \u8216\'91cause anything can happen in an ambush. With this mist rolling in, I might not know which way I\u8217\'92m shooting.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Same goes for me,\u8221\'94 said Forty, tongue half-in-cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb interrupted them both a dismissive, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pipe down, Sol\u8217\'92s sake.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Forty gave Dill one final fleer, then the two marched apart and settled down to watch Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mist bleed out of the mountains. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In truth, the humidity had already reached them; it was invisible, but Seb could smell the pleasant musk of moistened earth. And up in the mountains, the mist was no longer a mere mist, congealing as it was into clouds of fog, and a fog organized by magick\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d purpose was no mere fog, it\u8217\'92s vanguard mist spooled out into slender smoky tendrils that slid down into the hills like snakes. Some of them twirled up into the darkening sky and there the wind caught them, lifted them up higher, and splayed them out like fingers. A low, rolling drum of distant thunder echoed out from somewhere deep inside the mountains.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fair play to Elrahet,\u8221\'94 Papi said excitedly. Seb found himself agreeing. This was shaping up to be Elrahet\u8217\'92s finest bit of belly magic. It was, perhaps, too good. If he could see it, then a Mazyd could see it too. He might see the unnatural forms, see how the fog had a mind of its own and he might get spooked. To make matters worse, high above the mountain peaks, near where Seb assumed Elrahet\u8217\'92s cave was nestled, there was an invisible fissure in the sky from which gray clouds were creeping out. They crept out slowly, hesitantly, like cautious cattle out of the pen, but once they were out they began to billow as they fed on the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of the Elrahet\u8217\'92s lizard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t long until the fog swallowed the Ayramun\u8217\'92s ravine completely. Visibility diminished to a point where Seb\u8217\'92s near-sighted eyes were on equal footing with everyone else. The iron mist was so thick that Seb could hardly see the bend in the ravine. He looked anyways, because he expected, at any moment, Moto would come jogging back to get them moving again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then it began to rain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a sprinkling shower at first, little pricklings on the skin, a light peppering of the sandy rock and clay. This didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t last long, for the raindrops swelled and in half-a-hand they were no longer prickling but splattering. There wasn\u8217\'92t any rain cover in the ravine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A bit much, isn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94 Papi said as he sheltered his bow with his short brown cape. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t she know I can\u8217\'92t shoot good in the rain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92ll stop soon,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t stop.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The rain dribbled off the rocks and stony clay, and where there were depressions and scars in the earth the rain was pitter-pattering puddles into being. These puddles grew into boot-swelling pools that overflowed their limits. Streams poured down the banks of the ravine, following the run of furrows that ancient rains had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millennia. Seb figured it was more water in one short span than this stretch of the Sand had seen in a decade. It brought out the lizards\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 or rather pushed them out. A little grey bonbon popped out of the clay right next to Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s foot. Its swiveling eye looked mightily confused by sudden downpour. It was so flustered that it didn\u8217\'92t notice Seb\u8217\'92s heel come down on it\u8217\'92s head. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb looked over to young Papi. The boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Might as well be swimming,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Damn this goddamn rain!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The curse was hardly out his lips when a gnarled flash of white lightning split through the iron mist above.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CRACK-BOOM!}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A chorus of startled yelps echoed out from the Ayramun. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Papi looked like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d shat himself. \u8220\'93Elrahet\u8217\'92s never conjured more than a mist!\u8221\'94, he squealed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mizm, a grey-scruffed old-timer stationed across the ravine grumbled out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That old witch is gonna get us killed!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s Moto?\u8221\'94 came another ragged voice out the rain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Screw that,\u8221\'94 said another. \u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s Ayram?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 From there the Ayramun began to bicker. The specific charges and insults being thrown across the ravine weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t anything new, but the stress and seriousness was reaching new heights. If it weren\u8217\'92t for the rain dampening folk\u8217\'92s fighting spirit, there might have been a brawl. One man accused another of being a \u8216\'91pimpled frog-catcher\u8217\'92\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a slur implying Hrkan whoredom\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t begrudge them their bellyaches. This whole situation was a raw deal. He wasn\u8217\'92t prepared for this kind of weather. The ground under his butt was getting slick and muddy, and if it rained any harder it would be difficult to shoot a bow because the wetter his bowstring got, the more it lost its spring. And there was no telling what a pounding rain would do to an arrow\u8217\'92s flight because Seb had never done shot in such conditions. He knew enough to know that it was not good, and not good for an ambush where everything has to go right was downright bad.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb winced at the thought.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Downright bad?}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This kind of thinking, this of breaking the into \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91good\u8217\'92 and \u8216\'91bad\u8217\'92, this was a symptom of expectations.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The truth was that everything was happening exactly as it was supposed to happen.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb drew his shoulders in against the rain. This plunking rain. This purpose-driven rain. The fog, the bickering, these were purposeful, too\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 to what end, Seb wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure, but now that he was looking for purpose he could sense that a great and perhaps terrible purpose was brewing here. The Ayramun were about to intersect with destiny. And there were no bit-part players here, for poor and lousy as they may seem, these Ayramun were people, and all people were descendants of the first man and woman, meaning a thousand generations of toil had birthed them. A thousand generations of struggle lay behind each of these soggy, grumpy faces. At the dawn of creation they were made heirs to the All-White Spark. Each of them were necessary beings, godlike in their way, as all things are, for if but one of them was missing then things might not happen as they were supposed to happen. And that meant that each death that was coming would be necessary, too, Seb was sure of that, and he was sure that it would end in death, for the weather and mood was much too awry for unqualified optimism. Maybe not everyone would die, but some would. Maybe he, himself, would die, though he\u8217\'92d prefer it if his contribution to the Divine Plan involved living to a ripe old age.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Was that an expectation, ripe old age? If he was destined for an early grave, was it wrong to want to avoid it? Does right and wrong have anything to do with it?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His thoughts were pierced by the three-chirp alarm of the Red-Winged Tresset coming from around the bend. The ravine went silent, and all eyes peered into the mist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then came the sound of two running feet splashing in the thin ravine stream. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Out the fog came Moto. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He motioned for everyone to join him. All the Ayramun filtered down into the ravine\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly and crowded around their temp?

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A refrain of mixed agreement broke out. Some shushed, and others shushed back. Moto tried to calm them all with plaintive hands, saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93People. Please.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Please my ass!\u8221\'94 said Tizm. \u8220\'93This rain is gonna ruin everything.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks?\u8221\'94 asked Papi.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The admission that it was Hrks, not Blackwood Jandri men, sent a wave of discontent rippling through the gathered Ayramun.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Someone on the outer edge of the huddle blurted out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s this about Hrks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto raised his voice above the rain. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Minder and his Mazyd didn\u8217\'92t come with a Blackwood caravan. They came with a Hrkan guard.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb as another round of and epithets broke out, followed by another round of shushing and counter-shushing. Moto again tried to calm the gathered with nothing but a pleading gesture. In the end he resorted to a sharp whistle, which shut everyone right up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The fact that it\u8217\'92s Hrks doesn\u8217\'92t change a damned thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Dill, his bald head sticking up defiant in the rain, like a veiny, boiled egg, spoke up, saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All the better! I\u8217\'92d rather kill a Hrk than a Jandri man.\u8221\'94 }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words were a for Seb, and as with all revelations, the first step is doubt\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it couldn\u8217\'92t be the same ravine where Gugi had found that dead body.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92ve all got karkle bushes in them.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look,\u8221\'94 said Moto, \u8220\'93All we have to do is sneak up and shoot them. It\u8217\'92ll be the easiest thing in the world. I know it\u8217\'92s raining hard, but you won\u8217\'92t need to feather a Hrk at ten-score yards. With this rain and fog we can get up close. You won\u8217\'92t miss. You can throw stones at them if you want to. You can stuff mud down their throats if you want to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s Ayram?\u8221\'94 asked another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  A quiver of frustration flashed in Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face and he shot a quick, pleading look to the heavens before he said to those gathered, \u8220\'93This is happening whether you like it or not.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He turned and pushed his way past a few Ayramun and set off back north. After the briefest hesitation, big Dill marched after him, and at his encouragement, everyone else followed. Together they were small, sad herd of outland folk, a jumble of soggy wool and tired feet splashing in the building stream.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb kept to the back as they climbed up and out of the ravine and then crossed over a few others. They tramped through a flooding basin, and all the while Seb eyed the rainy mist with suspicion, for Providence was at work in that mist. Unlike the Providence that people pray for and expect, this Providence was providing something undesired, Seb was sure of that. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d once heard a priest say that while Gods provided the good, they also had to make room for it by taking things away. Removidence is what it was\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s what Seb called it. Or Destructidence. There wasn\u8217\'92t an established word for it, which in itself was a telling sign of the times, for it showed that people only cared about their relationship with the divine when they got something good out of the deal. The Ayramun were no different.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Gugi found his way to Seb at the back of the wandering troupe, it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t to share in the . The skinny man\u8217\'92s face was agog with fear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb asked him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you want?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ya know where we headed, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb chuckled and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They won\u8217\'92t listen to me either.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They would. I would. That ravine is cursed, and people gonna die if we get down in it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you said if we moved that body out of that ravine, then the curse would be moved out with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, but I was just sayin\u8217\'92 shit. What do I know about curses? For all I know that curse is what brought this storm and lured them Hrks down in it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you tryin\u8217\'92 to get out of payin\u8217\'92 me my burgeons?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gugi\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face at the thought that Seb could think about debts in a time like this. Before he could voice that concern, a muted horse\u8217\'92s whinny was heard through the splashing rain. Everyone instinctively crouched down and rushed to the of a sloping mound. They were still a few-score yards from the ravine where the Hrks were sheltering. Nothing of those troops could be seen through the mist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto , voice low, he asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You the two that scouted out this ravine, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gugi and Seb both nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Any thing we should know about it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gugi was quick to respond, saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Other than it\u8217\'92s cursed and we shouldn\u8217\'92t be here, no.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Cursed? What do you mean, cursed?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the ravine where we found that dead body.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay, what I meant was, I need to know the lay of the land. I can\u8217\'92t see through this damned mist, so I don\u8217\'92t know if there\u8217\'92s an easy out for them up one of the slopes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gugi was aghast that Moto had brushed off the word \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91curse\u8217\'92 so easily. He said, \u8220\'93Moto. I\u8217\'92m tellin\u8217\'92 you. That place is cursed. It\u8217\'92s gonna get us killed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So what? If it\u8217\'92s cursed for us, it\u8217\'92s cursed for them too. Doubly so for them, cause they\u8217\'92re sitting in it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, but we the ones who found the body! We the ones that been warned! Not them. Us\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, is there any way in and out of that long stretch that might be too easy for them Hrks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If they\u8217\'92re in that long, straight stretch, it\u8217\'92s mostly steep, but there is one little nook on the eastern side that\u8217\'92s like a natural stair.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How wide?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not that wide. It\u8217\'92s on the southern end.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto paused to think, then said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want you two to go south cross to the other side of the ravine where it\u8217\'92s safe. Then work your way back and then set up where that stair is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just us two?\u8221\'94 Gugi asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto turned and motioned towards his sister, Moteah, who was not enthused to be at her brother\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s beck and call. Like Moto, she carried herself with an air of authority, though she was even more upfront about it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said to her, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get Dill and eight others to follow Seb and Gugi. You\u8217\'92re going to set up on the other side of the ravine, and we\u8217\'92re going to try and push the Hrks towards you. So be quick and be ready. When I whistle, it starts.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah snuck away, gathered up Dill and the nearest eight Ayramun, then brought them to Seb and Gugi. Gugi wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t about to take charge, so Seb took the initiative and led them all south towards the mountains, keeping the course of the cursed ravine a few-score yards away to his right. When they were far enough south that the walls of the ravine weren\u8217\'92t so steep, they made a safe and unseen crossing to the western side, and once there, they headed back north, keeping low and quiet, again giving the ravine a wide berth. Seb stopped when he found himself crouching in the very spot that he\u8217\'92d been standing in that morning when Gugi called out to him about something he\u8217\'92d found. He listened hard and could hear the contented snorts of wagon horses that had been expecting a scorching day.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb crouched down, and the rest Ayramun behind him did likewise. He ambled over to the ravine and slithered up against a big, solid boulder that leaned over the ravine\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lip. From there he could hear horse hooves stamping in the ravine\u8217\'92s stream, and if a horse was that close, then a Hrk might be closer. He didn\u8217\'92t dare peek over the boulder to get a lay of the, but when he realized that there wasn\u8217\'92t in the air, curiosity got the best of him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb steeled his nerves and peered over the boulder and down into the ravine. Right below him were two horses still hitched to a wagon, and behind them were two more horses and another wagon, and whatever was behind them was lost to the mist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 So far as Seb could tell, there was nothing in the wagons. Nothing lying around the ravine, either. Not one person in sight. Not one red-tufted, white shawled, black-bearded Hrkan skelsi was huddled up in that ravine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb turned to his troupe behind him, and the confusion on his face must have been easy to read because Dill came scampering up to Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rock and ducked low against it\u8217\'92s hump as he peered over it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Upon seeing the Hrkless ravine, he muttered, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not good.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah joined the two men at the boulder and quietly stole a look for herself. Her usually uptight expression went slack in surprise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are they?\u8221\'94 she whispered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Dill said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ask your brother where they be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah rolled her eyes. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t uncommon for people to blame her for her brother\u8217\'92s missteps, but Seb knew that she probably hated Moto more than most.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe they\u8217\'92ve moved further north. There\u8217\'92s a long overhang there that\u8217\'92s almost like a cave.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And what, they just left their horses here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Them horses ain\u8217\'92t going nowhere. Wagon wheels are rocked.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Dill said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should whistle Moto.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. The Hrks might hear.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How can a Hrk hear a whistle if he\u8217\'92s not here to hear it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dismay, and Seb\u8217\'92s amazement, Dill put his finger and his thumb to his lips and whistled out an alarm. It was a bright and sharp whistle that pierced the sheets of rain and probably carried a quarter mile. Down in the ravine, the horse\u8217\'92s ears swiveled as they lifted their heads from the rainwater stream to stare skeptically at Seb\u8217\'92s rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nothing else happened.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soft rain sprinkled down around them. The eerie mist was as placid as ever. Seb supposed that the silence was a good sign, because if there were Hrks resting nearby they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have been stirred up and would be charging at them with wild eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When no whistled reply leaped out of the fog from the other side of the ravine, Dill growled a curse under his breath and smacked the boulder with the side of his fist. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is horse shit,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Amateur shit that\u8217\'92s gonna get us killed!\u8221\'94}

Seb peered into that fog and could just make out a few moving shadows. Ayramun by his estimation. And just as he was wondering what they could be up to, he saw Moteah stand up, arc her bow and loose an arrow right at them. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In clean dry air, a gull-feather arrow with a whistling nock would trill with excitement when released, but soggy as it was, Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arrow disappeared into the mist without so much as a whine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A moment later, and one of the distant shadows yelped, shuddered, then sank to the ground.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Dill grabbed Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robe as she nocked another arrow, and before he could berate her for going and killing an Ayramun, a shout of alarm rang out across the way, and this was followed by the Hrkan horn of war whose bellow thrilled the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 BWEEEEEEEEoooooooooooo}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At the horn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s urging, the shadows all stood up and came sprinting towards the ravine.

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then a man amongst them broke rank stepped forward. He seemed misshapen, and was bare and bald, and his sleeves were rolled up to reveal an intricate tattoo that weaved round his wrists and up his arms. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then his throat began to glow.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 An arrow came whistling, }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In clean, dry air his Tresset-feathered arrow would trill with excitement when released, but wet as it was it simply jumped from the waxed string of his bow.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said the Mazyd.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A grey-bearded soldier, who Seb presumed to be Captain Trez, was standing behind the Minder with crossed arms and fire in his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Minder said to his Mazyd, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I worry, Obo, that you have matured too quickly.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Mazyd bowed his head and took a respectful knee. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry,\u8221\'94 he said.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The captain swung and brought the rod down hard on the Mazyd\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder socket. The whole arm sunk down, went limp, clearly dislocated, but the Mazyd\u8217\'92s face was unperturbed. Seb cringed more than the Mazyd did.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Captain stepped back to admire his handiwork, then said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They don\u8217\'92t make Mazydai like they used to. Each new breed is more impudent than the last.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I should say it\u8217\'92s not working.\u8221\'94}
