\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Rewrite to have Seb be in the shadows - Seb\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s perspective.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Maybe have Seb offer up blood.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 A big deal to summon clouds over here. Need powerful blood. }
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then should I whistle the boys?\u8221\'94 Pella asked, looking a little grim. It was a look which came quite easy for her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 Seb replied. \u8220\'93Be sure to stab and flutter it. Like you say, we need caution.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Pella nodded, then put her hands to her mouth and whistled the song of the Jade Tresset to let the men know that the ambush was on. She stabbed and fluttered the high notes, as Seb had directed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb waited a bit for twittered replies to spring from his people\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hiding spots, and then he squeezed his giant frame into the little cave behind them, leaving Pella to deal with Seculla and Mandrameen as they bickered over who got to look through the scope.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Cloistered within the cramped cave was the witch Elrahet. She was an older woman, five years younger than Pella, although a specific age was rarely a thing ascribed to people of the Sand. Like Seb, she was Jandrian, and all Jandrians seemed to foreigners like they had been quarried fully formed out of the earth. Their features were as dark, hard, and solemn as any slab of Melthasite ore. Their sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the bark of any pepperwood tree. Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the sizable horned lizard over whose corpse she squatted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The beast was belly up, and her fingers were knuckle deep in it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s guts, twisting and twirling as her lips whispered incantations and her eyes searched the pink sliver of morning sky that peeked through the crack in the rocks above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s almost time,\u8221\'94 Seb warned.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, though she did not take her eyes off the sky, nor her hand from the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s corpse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What thing is more vital than blood?\u8221\'94 she asked the world. \u8220\'93Blood cold as ice\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She pushed down hard with her palm to squeeze acids out from the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Blood hot as a raging fire\u8230\'85.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Her knotted fingers worked on the intestines. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We would be gods if not for blood\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up into the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We would be dust without it.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She threw the entrails down, back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nothing happened.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly wider. Into the hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, and then pushed the beast\u8217\'92s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pale belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Seb supposed that the thing was somehow still alive, only for it to go limp again when Elrahet pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is possible,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said to Seb in a quiet whisper, such that none outside could hear, \u8220\'93that the beast is infertile.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So this won\u8217\'92t work?\u8221\'94 Seb asked as he knelt across from her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not with this insipid material.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb poked the lizard\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s corpse with an adventurous finger. He could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-grey intestines inside writhed and pulsed like a knotted mass of worms. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He was impressed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was worth a try,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet hissed at his dubiety, then said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I need a fertile stomach.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb twiddled this thumbs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fresh blood from a fertile stomach,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb tsked his teeth, and then he pulled up his sleeve and extended his hairy brown arm towards Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your blood?\u8221\'94 Elrahet croaked. \u8220\'93Get me one of the Pazard boys or something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no time. It\u8217\'92s either me or no one. Or Moteah.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That old Imperial sow isn\u8217\'92t fertile.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well then,\u8221\'94 Seb said, extending his arm further.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given, even by one Jandrian to another. Elrahet had been Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s witch for years and he had never offered a drop. She tried to gauge his countenance to see if he was sincere - but his face was set deep in the shadow of his hood and his eyes were sunk back behind bushy brows. His beard hid whatever slight expression his lips might reveal. Even clean shaven and in direct light, the difference between his smile and a frown was imperceptible. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She looked down at his arm and eyed the veins that bulged under the skin. She knew his blood would be potent. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We can do this without you,\u8221\'94 Seb said with more than a hint of impatience.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At that, Elrahet pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from her bag and laid them between herself and Seb. Then she unsheathed a patterned blade from her belt and held it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s curve length-wise to Seb\u8217\'92s wrist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I value your trust,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And I yours,\u8221\'94 Seb replied. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet savored his courtesy with a near-toothless grin, then eagerly plunged her dagger\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tip into his flesh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She flicked her wrist with expert care and opened the vein.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb remained unstirred, watching with serious intent as blood bubbled out of the wound and ran around his wrist in a steady stream to drip into the bowl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  He jerked his arm free.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s it.\u8221\'94 He said. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The bowl was but half full.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your gift is humbling,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said, \u8220\'93but if that is it\u8230\'85 don\u8217\'92t expect much.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I did say that we could do this without you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet scowled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Think better of where you sit on the scales of the Sebun. Speak to me like that again, and I\u8217\'92ll have your stomach turned into a bag.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Elrahet took the bowl and began to flick Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s blood onto the lizard\u8217\'92s corpse, careful to make sure that not a drop hit the dirt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb took the yard of linen to dress his wound. As he tried to maneuver his hips round so he could leave, he bumped Elrahet. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get out of here!\u8221\'94 she snapped. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb laughed as he did.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Maybe do short desc. Of the ravine here.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first signs of Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s magic were the wispy vapor trails that circulated high in the atmosphere above her cave. They twirled and danced, driven by unnatural purpose, though they were so slight that they could hardly be said to be there at all. By the time Seb sat down at his hiding spot behind a couple of small boulders on the northern slope of the ravine, the vapor trails had begun to congeal into something thicker.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soon the wind picked up and began to brush them into form. A pleasant musk of earthy air blew down into the ravine. If Seb had not been looking for it, he might not have noticed how a light fog subtly shifting into existence. Just as he began to wonder if the crew had taken notice, a low rolling drum of distant thunder echoed through the valley, though there was, as yet, no storm from which it could have come.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fair play to Elrahet,\u8221\'94 said Papillian excitedly. The boy was stationed behind a boulder closer to the road. Seb glared down at him with enough sternness to shush him. He didn\u8217\'92t blame the lad for the outburst as this was shaping up to be Elrahet\u8217\'92s finest bit of belly magic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was perhaps too good. The caravan was still far out. Perhaps they had not yet made it into the valley\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fingers. Perhaps they could see the cyclonic flow of haze that now swirled above Elrahet\u8217\'92s cave. Still, Seb half expected that it all might fizzle out - humans made for poor magicians - but all his doubts were allayed when dense clouds began to creep out from some invisible fissure in the sky.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They crept out slowly, like cautious cattle out of the pen. Once they were out over the ravine they began to feed, to chew and swallow the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of the lizard that Elrahet had prepared. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then it began to rain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a sprinkling shower at first, just little pricklings on the skin, just a light peppering of the sandy rocks and clay. The drizzle cleansed the air of the desert dust that was ever present in the Sand, the stuff that clogged the nose and scratched the throat. In fact the air was so crisp that this was the first time in forever that Seb could take in a full, clean breath. It was a tranquil moment, but short lived, for minute by minute the wind swelled and the rain thickened and the storm above ballooned into a supercell the size of several mountains. Lightning flashed and thrashed around in the belly of the beast above, banging the drum of thunder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 More and more the rain began to pour. Without shelter it seemed like torture. The short and woody weeds that had managed to scrape out an existence in the ravine were whipped to and fro as the wind and rain stripped leaf from stem. It came down hard and wet on the men as well. Seb found little comfort in the fact that he had his back to it all. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At least the earth seemed to enjoy it, parched and desiccated as it was. It took its time to drink its fill. It filtered the water through sand and silt and then trickled it down into the deep reservoirs of the world. It savoured every drop, and it drank slowly, which meant that it did not take long for the surface to become soaked. Soon rain began to pitter-patter into puddles, and water ran down the ravine, seeking out the familiar routes that it had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millenia. Where once there were cracks, pits, and sinks in the rock and clay, there were now streams and cascades. Where once there were depressions and scars, there were now pools in which desert life would find succor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb looked over to the young Papillian. Though the rain was rare and precious on this side of the Junei Mountains, the boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers. He might as well have been swimming. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He muttered a curse, and the storm cursed back.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CRACK-BOOM!}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A bright and gnarled flash of lightning split the dark sky above. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It hit somewhere near in the cliffs behind them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone jumped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Elra\u8217\'92s never conjured more than foggy mist!\u8221\'94 Papillian exclaimed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Colm, a beastly man to Papillian\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s side could be heard as well. \u8220\'93Bit much innit?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb disagreed. By this point the valley road was getting good and slick and muddy. Laden wagons would have to be dragged through it. They would be moving slowly, if they would move at all - though that was cause for some concern. They might not even make it into the ravine. Or, they might have turned around and fled the valley as soon as the first showers hit them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Then a faint horse\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whinny pierced the splashing of the rain. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb turned his gaze southward. There he could just make out the shapes of white horses coming round the bend. Their riders were hunched in their saddles, sore backs and sore nerves all around. Their horses moved slowly, leaning into the deluge. Seb could almost feel the mud draining their already tired legs of vigor. He smiled when he saw one stumble and throw its rider into a growing rivulet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nonetheless they all plodded onward, heads down against the pelting rain, filtering into the ravine three by three. Their wagons were faring as Seb expected, with drivers working hard to steady the mood of the mule-teams that had grown discontent with the whole situation. If the mules had been men they would have taken up arms long ago in a suicidal bid for freedom. As beasts, all they could do was scream through their suffering and sway against the strain and slip in the viscous mud.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb would have been perfectly pleased if he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t noticed the olive skin and tufts of blackred hair peeking out from under the soldiers\u8217\'92 turbans. They were each, to a man, Roman[a]. This was indeed a company of Imperial Cavalry. Then he caught sight of the wooden septum piercings that popped out of their noses like bull horns. These were men of the Hallowed Guard- the absolute elite.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb's pulse quickened, and he could feel his nerves tighten as he peered out at them from behind his rock. Just a few sheets of rain separated him from this pride of lions - to be this close was suicide. Even though all smells were driven down into the earth, and all edges and colors were blurred, and all sounds below a shout were drowned out by the torrential downpour, Seb felt like they could sense him. Such is the case when a predator hunts a predator; they have little familiarity, little tolerance for doubt and fear. It does not take much of that drug to overwhelm them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 By the time the middle of column had reached Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s position, he had steadied his nerve. He then leaned out from behind his rock, aimed his bow towards one of their number, notched an arrow, and let it fly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In clean, dry air his gull-feather arrow would trill with excitement when released, but so wetted by the rain it simply jumped from the waxed string of his bow. So quiet and obscured was its flight, and so loud was the wind and rain, that even after it struck its target and sank him low in his saddle, the caravan remained oblivious to the danger.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  The dead rider\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s horse took a few steps, then the body slipped from its perch and fell into the mud. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 So began the battle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Cries of horse and rider flew as a hail of arrows leapt from the slopes of the ravine, planting themselves in throats and ribs. Some bounced off armor or missed their marks all together and fell into the mud. Even Seb had trouble in these tight quarters, for the wind and rain was so strong that they carried his arrows unpredictably; just a meter was enough to spare or doom a life. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hardly a third of the riders were stricken in the first few volleys. For a company of Hallowed Guardsmen, the bodycount was no convincing argument for retreat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  An officer\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s horn sounded. It bellowed then sank into a deep register that rumbled the streams and puddles that already ran red with blood. Those riders which had not already dismounted did, and they pulled their heater shields from off their horses' packs, then rushed to form up a defensive shape centered in the ravine just below Seb. Here and there one of them would shudder then fall to his knees as an arrow snuck through the wall of shields, his hands clutching wherever his flesh was pierced. His compatriots would kick him out of the circle and down into the mud, then close ranks behind him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They moved and thought as one, and like a leaf-scaled wyrm caught out in the open Sand by a falcon, they curled and curled again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb eyed them warily, wondering what they could possibly do to prevent his party\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arrows from whittling them down one by one.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then a man amongst them broke rank stepped forward. He seemed misshapen, and was bare and bald, and his sleeves were rolled up to reveal an intricate tattoo that weaved round his wrists and up his arms. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then his hands began to glow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb notched an arrow and aimed for the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck, so that he might stifle the power that he channeled in those arms and that he brewed in those lungs. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before he could let it fly, the storm intervened. }
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CRACK-BOOM!}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Need to magnify the dstruction. THe horror of his comrades dying.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Play up the arrow. Blessing of the arrow. Doctor puts ointment on it. }
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A bolt of lighting shot down from the high icy reaches of the thunderhead. It struck the middle of the road with an incredible ferocity, and as it did it seemed to explode, throwing wind, rain, and flesh in all directions. The shockwave threw Seb back against the rocks of the ravine, and there was a muted thwack as his skull hit the broad face of a sandstone boulder. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then things went black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  }
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She put a knife to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s throat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is your father\u8217\'92s fault,\u8221\'94 she said, then gave him a scar to remind him of it.}
