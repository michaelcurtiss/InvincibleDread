\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He moaned as his sleep crusted eyes split open. There was barely enough light bouncing around from him to discover that he had, somehow, been brought back up to the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ladder room. It was empty. The tumble of coals were still there, and the Ayramun\u8217\'92s packs were still there, so he hadn\u8217\'92t been left behind. He decided to climb the ladder and see if anyone was lounging around outside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He hoped someone was up there preparing a meal. The passing of the God\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon had left him hungry.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He climbed up the ladder\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rungs and as he moved the soreness in his body worked itself out quickly. That must have been the work of the God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon, too. He decided to ask Seb about it as soon as he got the chance, but that would be all he he would ask about\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he would have to pretend to remember everything that had happened down in that cave, including walking back himself, because he didn\u8217\'92t want to give Seb the impression that he couldn\u8217\'92t handle a single sliver of that beautiful burgeon. He wanted to try them again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri pulled himself up onto the cobbled black stone of the tiny desert temple floor. He kept calling it a temple, but there was no altar or kneeling stone\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only that hole in the ground and the wooden ladder. There was a scrawl of Old Jandri script circumscribing the inner dome, but Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t read it. He guessed it told of the life of some dead desert father who\u8217\'92d died here and was buried in a crypt somewhere down below. He shuddered at thought of a life wasted in service to a long dead god.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stepped out into the cool air and was surprised to find it was evening. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d slept through the day, and soon, he assumed, they would be moving again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All of the Ayramun were gathered at the top of the nearest hill. They stood with backs turned, facing west, facing the setting sun. They were a remarkable set of outland pokes, all different sizes, and with Obo included, still strapped in his litter and leaning against Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s leg, they ranged from the smallest person alive to the largest. Only Seb, at the end of the line, turned and regarded Mandri\u8217\'92s presence. This he did with a smirk and a wink, and Mandri felt compelled to return the courtesy. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scrambled up the hill to join him, and as soon as he arrived all schemes of stealing Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeons fled from thought, for it was not the setting sun which stretched out above the horizon, but a heavy black cloud as dark as the oncoming night. It was the Lord of clouds for it stretched out across the world and churned it over. It could have been mistaken for rampaging herd of mountains, if such a thing were possible. And though it was dark, Mandri was struck by its color, for its upper reaches pierced the shadow of world\u8217\'92s edge to catch the fleeing light day\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a tip of golden red oozing into pink.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The sense of magnificence was helped along by little westwind zephyrs tickling his skin. And so far as he could tell, this storm was coming straight for them. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Holy shit,\u8221\'94 he muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothin\u8217\'92 holy about it,\u8221\'94 Seb croaked. He was standing next to Mandri, arms crossed, and for once he wasn\u8217\'92t chewing a spine\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it hung there on his lip, forgotten. \u8220\'93Big \u8216\'91ol bastard, ain\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This storm was much bigger than that. It was a storm of legend, an Ugmukheen, a child of Muk, inheritor of His wrath. To Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s knowledge, the Sand hadn\u8217\'92t seen a storm anywhere near this size for at least three hundred years, for that\u8217\'92s when Muk had perished. He\u8217\'92d seen paintings of Ugmukheens\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a wall of sand rendered in lurid reds and purples reaching to the heavens, its face lit up by jagged spears of lightning. Twisting funnels swept the land before it, harbingers of its destruction, and in the foreground, a sympathetic figure\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a human, or a lonely, trembling tree\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 whose only purpose is to accentuate the sheer scale of the monster about to swallow it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was as taken by the sight of the storm as everyone else.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is unnatural,\u8221\'94 he said in wonder. This was the most honest emotion Obo had uttered since Mandri knew him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course it\u8217\'92s natural,\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93Everything that happens is natural.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s coming from an impossible direction,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto peaked around Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s figure so that he could sneer at the Mazid as he said, \u8220\'93What would you know about it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve read every book and scroll that counts the weather in this part of the world, and every Ugmukheen for the past thousand years was born abreast the Gongee Sea.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They form there because when the high Gongee winds stop blowing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it\u8217\'92s like taking the lid off a pot of steaming water. And the Gongee Sea is four days to the south, not west. That\u8217\'92s not to mention that Ugmukheens certainly don\u8217\'92t look like }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 that}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 .\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was unimpressed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Clearly, they do look like that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you ever been caught in a Ugmukheen?\u8221\'94 Obo asked him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. Have you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazid\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 said Ayram. \u8220\'93An Ugmukheen is a thing you don\u8217\'92t see coming. It\u8217\'92s said the first you know of it is when your own dust overtakes you. And you can walk in it. You can survive it. You can not survive a thing like }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 that.}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 He pointed to the distant storm with his iron spear and said, \u8220\'93A storm like that would lashed the flesh from bone. That\u8217\'92s no Ugmukheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet, who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been brooding under her hood, said, \u8220\'93This must be Pell. Her and no one else. Every God who could have done it is long dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are we going to do?\u8221\'94 Moto asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We can\u8217\'92t walk with that monster runnin\u8217\'92 us down.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We stay in the hole,\u8221\'94 Elrahet replied, \u8220\'93And we pray to all that is holy that these hills don\u8217\'92t swallow us up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But that would then we\u8217\'92d be caught,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93If we don\u8217\'92t keep moving, the Hrks will catch us long before reach Bullr.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s got to be another way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We could try for the Kari plain,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram shook his head and stroked his beard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Could try the Goree Pass,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Goree Pass\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Ayram repeated as his fingers twirled the tips of his beard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Goree will never work,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not?\u8221\'94 Seb asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because the Goree Pass is cursed. It\u8217\'92s as cursed as that damned storm.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not cursed enough for the Greskalun to live there,\u8221\'94 Seb replied.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If those damned Rigas can track the Mazid from anywhere, then they\u8217\'92ll sense his coming and be at the Goree Pass long before we get there.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If this storm curves north once it passes, then it\u8217\'92ll get in their way and give us room.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if it doesn\u8217\'92t curve north?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram answered for Seb and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then I\u8217\'92ll have to think of something else. But I like the Goree Pass. Greskal could help us. The man hates Hrk as much as anyone.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Every time Ayram pulled at his beard and twirled out a tuft, the hair sprang right back into that smooth, bread-loaf shape.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what we\u8217\'92re doing,\u8221\'94 Ayram finally declared. \u8220\'93We wait out the storm, then head for the Goree.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With that, he picked Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter up, then turned and side-step shuffled back down the hill. Moto stamped after him to fret about this change of plans. Of the rest of the Ayramun, Moteah seemed most unaffected by current events. She was standing on the hill\u8217\'92s top-most point, a black rock which put her up a foot higher than the rest. She had a long reedy stick which she\u8217\'92d brought with her from that western plain and with it she drew little abstract faces and then she\u8217\'92d watch the wind brush them away grain by grain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was watching the storm looking pleased with himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well,\u8221\'94 Mandri said suggestively, \u8220\'93We suddenly find ourselves in possession of some recreational time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb patted his pocket and what-do-you-know, there in his eye was another sparkling wink. He wandered back down the hill.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t follow too quickly as he\u8217\'92d arouse too much suspicion. Someone would ask why he wanted to hang out with Seb and he\u8217\'92d not have a good answer.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl was sitting next to Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rock. She sat cross-legged, taking in the wind, squinting as she did. Her tangled mess of sun-kissed hair blew past her shoulders to reveal the smallest set of ears. Hers was a face that suggested deep and penetrating thought, though Mandri knew from experience that such faces were almost always a lying.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you thinking about?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m thinking of all the ways that this is going to go wrong,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I hope I\u8217\'92m not the cause of any of those.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You aren\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 she said, and somehow that stung him, even though it was perfectly true.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Anyone else hungry?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s hardtack in my bag,\u8221\'94 said Moteah.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you have anything green?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Green? Like what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know. I\u8217\'92m in the mood for something pulled out of the earth.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, do you see a single sprig of green in all of }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 that}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 ?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She was pointing to the world at large, and of course, there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a speck of green in any of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I\u8217\'92ll just, uh\u8230\'85I\u8217\'92ll just go find something to eat then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He scrambled down the hill to go find Seb and burgeons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Unfortunately, Moto found him first. The man was climbing up the temple ladder just as Mandri was about to climb down, and when Moto was up and out he blocked Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s way with the scabbard of his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are you going?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To find a snack.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No free food until you show me you can earn your keep.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In his other hand was a Hrkan short sword and scabbard that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d salvaged from the battle of Minting Rock. He extended this out towards Mandri, hilt first, clearly expecting Mandri to take it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t imagine what you\u8217\'92d want me to do with this,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93Do your nails need filing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was not amused. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you remember our conversation?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You mean, before I threw myself into that demon pit?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That one. I was going easy on you then. Now that you\u8217\'92re Ayramun\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 well, you\u8217\'92re not Ayramun\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 now that you\u8217\'92re out here with us, you have to earn your keep. So take the god damned sword.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri hesitated, but the man was serious, so he grabbed the sword and followed Moto back outside. The burgeons would have to wait.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was outside as well. He was propped against the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall. When Moto noticed him, he said, \u8220\'93You could learn something too and pass it on to your Hrkan Lords. For all their bluster, your Skulsi are shit fighters.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, I heard how you and Ayram cut them down.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re brave, I\u8217\'92ll give them that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Too brave, I think\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92d rather they were cowards?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In the Hrkan art of war, there\u8217\'92s no such thing as cowardice. There\u8217\'92s no such thing as bravery, either. A brave man and a cowardly man are both dead men, for bravery and cowardice are both symptoms of unpreparedness. If a soldier is ever called on to be brave, then his commander has failed him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of all the words from Shis\u8230\'85what are you talking about?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo adopted the wizened look of a lecturer. He said, as if reciting some long-remembered writ, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There is no bravery, and there is no cowardice. Either the fighting man is fully prepared for what he faces and he is victorious, or his commander has failed and must kill himself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto walked several paces away and he drew his gold-trimmed sword with a flourish. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can be as prepared as you can possibly be, but still face bad odds. That\u8217\'92s what calls for bravery.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo continued on with his recitation. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you face unbalanced odds, then you have failed in your maneuvers and have arrived to battle unprepared, and so you should kill yourself\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 these are not my words, they are Lord Kashkan\u8217\'92s.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright, lesson number one, Mandri\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 don\u8217\'92t ever listen to a Hrk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I already don\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lesson number two is to always run away from a fight if you can.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I might be a prodigy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, you\u8217\'92re not, because your mind is as undeveloped as your arm. We don\u8217\'92t have time to strengthen either, so we\u8217\'92ve got to be smart about how we work. So let\u8217\'92s get you thinking. First\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 your goal. You and I are about to duel. What is it, in specific terms, you are trying to do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can I first ask why we\u8217\'92re doing this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll do whatever I can to help out, but me swinging a sword, I\u8217\'92m more likely to hurt myself than a Hrk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re doing simple stuff here, Mandri, believe me, I know you can\u8217\'92t handle to much. So answer my question. Or do you want to go see some lizards again?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay, I\u8217\'92ll play.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then answer my question.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I forgot what it was.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo chuckled, and Moto snorted and shook his head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you\u8217\'92re in a fight, what are you trying to do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Survive.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Be more specific.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Run away.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright, fine, running away is good.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I don\u8217\'92t think I need to be convinced that I should run away, so what are we doing here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was almost at his wits end already. When he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d first drawn his sword, his shoulders were eager, now they were struggling to care. He said, \u8220\'93In the event that you can\u8217\'92t run away, what is another specific goal you can set out for yourself?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kill my enemy before he kills me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Be }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 specific}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . What }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 specifically}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  are you going to do to achieve that? Most blows to the body don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t kill quickly. There\u8217\'92s only a few reliable spots that will end a fight right away. The heart,\u8221\'94 He pounded his chest. \u8220\'93And the head.\u8221\'94 He tapped his skull the blunt edge of his sword. \u8220\'93If you stick a Skulsi in the arm then you\u8217\'92ve failed to kill him quickly, and now he\u8217\'92s free to have his way with you. Half a Skulsi\u8217\'92s training goes into figuring out all the different ways to get back at an enemy who\u8217\'92s in the process of killing him. He\u8217\'92s trained to know, if you cut him down this way or that, sword or spear, what\u8217\'92s the best thing to do to get you back. The Hrks can afford to think like that. They can afford one-for-one trades.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hrk can afford twenty-for-one trades,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The fact is,\u8221\'94 Moto said, annoyed at being interrupted. \u8220\'93The fact is that when fighting a Skulsi man you have to wound him, and then get out of his way.\u8221\'94 To illustrate the point he cut a dramatic swath out of the air and then jumped away from it. \u8220\'93And you take what your opponent gives you. When it comes to Skulsi, what they give you is their sword arm. Your goal\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 your }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 specific}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  goal\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 is to attack their sword arm. And we can get more specific than that.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see,\u8221\'94 Mandri said as he gave his sword a clumsy swing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is what using your mind feels like, Mandri. Now, I know this is a lot to take in, but these things need to be rolling around in your head, because when the time comes, you\u8217\'92ll see, you\u8217\'92ll remember it. Focus on the key thing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 attack the sword arm.\u8221\'94 He raised his sword arm and gave the wind another few dramatic hacks, and he seemed extremely proud of all the air he\u8217\'92d just slaughtered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you live long enough you may learn something about the sublime art of killing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s nothing artful about killing,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not true,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93All artists are trying to get at the human heart, I simply take the most direct approach. The only difference is that the best artist is a matter of opinion, but the best swordsman\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s a matter of fact.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri blurted out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The best artist is not a matter of opinion.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Stung. Then came a dawning realization, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s right\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 you said you were a painter. Who\u8217\'92s the best painter then?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You wouldn\u8217\'92t know him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wouldn\u8217\'92t know him? Really? That\u8217\'92s what we call a thought-stopper. It\u8217\'92s the sign of a fool.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think that killing people is an artform. You are insane.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you ever killed anyone, Mandri?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. But I\u8217\'92ve seen enough of killing to know it\u8217\'92s nothing but a rude bunch of scuffling around until someone gets stabbed and dies.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You wouldn\u8217\'92t judge the entire art of painting from a child\u8217\'92s scribblings, would you? That\u8217\'92s what you saw, a child\u8217\'92s scribblings.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whatever.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 whatever}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  me, boy. If you knew who you were talking to you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be .\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who would win in a fight, you or Ayram?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The answer was obvious.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That depends on too many things,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s not enough context.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The context is you versus Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face went through such a series of contortions that he could have charged money to see the act. Somewhere in there was the suggestion that it was offensive to even ask the question. A few shades of disappointment as well, like he was upset with himself for letting things stray away from the lesson at hand. In the end, frustration won out and he said, \u8220\'93You know what? We\u8217\'92re done here. If you don\u8217\'92t want help staying alive, I won\u8217\'92t help you. Don\u8217\'92t ever come to me for help.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto stomped passed Mandri and fled into the temple, and before his head disappeared down the ladder, he paused and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep the sword.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri and Obo shared impish smiles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should probably head down as well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The storm.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sheathed his sword and hauled Obo into the temple and down the ladder. He wandered off to find Seb, but the idiot had gone to sleep. So instead of enjoying his life, he waited down there with the rest of the Ayramun, and they all waited for the storm to overtake them, which it did in no time at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 First came the soothing sound of wind-whipped sand splashing against the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bricks above. Every now and then a gust of wind would blow into the temple entrance and swirl around inside, and if it was strong enough, it blew though the hole in floor, turning the ladder room and the tunnel beyond into a sort of flute\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the faint whimpering whine sounded startlingly similar to the labored fits of a pregnant dog about to give birth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As the wind intensified, this whine steadied into a droll hum, a sound so annoying that all the Ayramun retreated deep into the tunnel. Only Mandrameen and Obo stayed in the ladder room. Obo was there because no one could be bothered to pick him up and move him. Mandri stayed because he was mesmerized by the sight and sound of the storm outside. Being near to such an awesome power was intoxicating.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He asked Obo, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How long do you think I could last up there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You might be able to last a hand or two, but the storm is still building.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stepped up to the ladder. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I just want to see what it feels like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It will feel like torture.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri continued on up the ladder despite the warning, and when he got to the top, he stuck his hand up to test the fury. Sand blasted his palm and he hissed in pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He hobbled back down, staring at his prickled hand. Tiny red welts dotted it all over, some of their centers bleeding red. He sat back down and moaned, but he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t regret it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t believe they\u8217\'92re trying to kill Solraheen,\u8221\'94 he said as the air outside grew dark. \u8220\'93If He could make this storm, then just imagine the kind of power He has.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen didn\u8217\'92t make this storm,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93As I\u8217\'92m sure you are aware, He is incapacitated at the moment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He might not have made this particular storm, but He made\u8230\'85 you know\u8230\'85 he made the structure for it. He made the world that made it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Profound,\u8221\'94 said Obo, sarcastically.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, He\u8217\'92s the only true creator. A painter just moves paint around, but it\u8217\'92s not }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 real}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  creation. Solraheen, he created the wind, he created the Sand, and from these, you get a storm. Why would anyone want to kill a being that could do that? That kind of creativity is the only thing that makes life worth living.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was feeling philosophical. All that was missing was the burgeon beer to complete the mood. A nice freeweed wrap would do as well, but he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t usually go in for them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He asked Obo, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you have any beliefs? Does a Mazid }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 believe}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  anything, or is that something you can\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do believe in something,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93I believe that there exists a thing which lies outside what can be known. I am not certain of it\u8217\'92s existence, but I believe that it is there, because even without a Spark I can see the bottom of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The bottom of what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The bottom of logic. The bottom of reason. Existence. I\u8217\'92m being necessarily vague here because I can\u8217\'92t quite put my finger on it. If I could, it wouldn\u8217\'92t be a belief.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t put your finger on it because you don\u8217\'92t have fingers.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Very funny.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, what about Solraheen?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen I can see and touch\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 if I was able. He requires no belief. He is simply there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded along but was getting bored. He got up and fashioned some pillows out of what packs had been left in the room. He gave a quick look for Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack, because a drop of God\u8217\'92s Eye would significantly improve the moment, but of course Seb had expected this and brought his pack along with him. Mandri was forced, against his will, to lay there sober and watch the hole in the ceiling and watch the storm\u8217\'92s rage build.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hand after hand passed like this, and all the while the winds outside were rising. His thoughts turned to children\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stories, the ones that warned about the Ugmukheen. They came with instructions\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hide the women, for as it passes it may fill their wombs. Beware the cough that can kill as vast quantities of sand are unavoidably inhaled. Have water, for it will strip the air of moisture, and its heat will sear the lungs. Mandri felt all these things coming on, except of course, the pregnancy. But the one thing he hadn\u8217\'92t seen was the snap and crack of lightning leaping from every surface. The stories were clear on that\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the air should come alive with little lightnings. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soon, the heat increased until the air was as hot as an oven. Mandri moved to flap his arms to air out his sweaty pits, and the motion conjured up a shocking spark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He yelped in surprise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your hair looks ridiculous,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri reached up and half the hairs on his head were standing on end. His excitement at this electric thrill was tempered by the sound of rock sliding atop rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The wind is lifting the dome,\u8221\'94 said Obo, with a hint of worry.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Should we be in here?\u8221\'94}
