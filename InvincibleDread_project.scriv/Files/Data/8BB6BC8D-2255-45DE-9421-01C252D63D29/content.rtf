When you don\u8217\'92t have the time to work hard, you\u8217\'92ve got to work smart. So let\u8217\'92s get you thinking about it. First, you got to define your goal. What is your goal in a fight with blades?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Survive.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ha! That\u8217\'92s right! Usually folk say, \u8216\'91stab him in the gut!\u8217\'92, but that discounts a perfectly viable strategy in any battle: simply run away.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can do that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you should! Always run away, if you can. I\u8217\'92m not just saying that because you\u8217\'92re you. If you pulled a blade on me, I\u8217\'92d run away. If it came down to it, a fight between you and I, I\u8217\'92d kill you a hundred times out of a hundred, but I\u8217\'92d still prefer run away.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because swords are gods-damned sharp, Mandri. Doesn\u8217\'92t take much for a blade like that to find the bone. Doesn\u8217\'92t take much for rot to find the smallest wound, either.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But if you beat me a hundred times out of a hundred\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A hundred times out of a hundred, yes. But a thousand times? A hundred thousand? I\u8217\'92m sure you\u8217\'92d get lucky in a few of those. The point is that there\u8217\'92s always risk and it\u8217\'92s never worth taking if you can just run away. I\u8217\'92ve seen men as skilled as the caliphants of legend get stabbed in the belly by raw recruits. It happens. Happens more often when you\u8217\'92re getting long in the tooth. You understand, eh? You and me, we can\u8217\'92t get away with things we used to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well I don\u8217\'92t think I need a lessons in running away.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Bullo chuckled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure. Sure. But in the event that you can\u8217\'92t run away, the goal has to become clearer than simply surviving.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kill my enemy before he kills me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So bloodthirsty. You could settle for incapacitate.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I suppose I could.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You must consider that many killing blows don\u8217\'92t kill quickly. There\u8217\'92s only a few reliable spots that will end a duel rightly. The heart,\u8221\'94 He pounded his chest. \u8220\'93And the head.\u8221\'94 He tapped his skull. \u8220\'93Of course you\u8217\'92ve got to consider armor in all this. It\u8217\'92s why Drekkan Socars wear breastplates and helmets and not much else. I\u8217\'92ve heard Drekkan Commissars say that the reason they don\u8217\'92t outfit their troops with more protection is because there\u8217\'92s not enough iron to go around, but really it\u8217\'92s because the Drekkan king can afford to lose a man so long as he takes an enemy down with him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thats inconsiderate if of the Drekkan king.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When a Drekkan soldier\u8217\'92s life gets cut down to minutes, he\u8217\'92s taught to spend them with reckless abandon, to do whatever he can to make sure the enemy whose blade is stuck in his belly goes down with him. You might not believe it, but they\u8217\'92ve got a whole discipline that teaches them how, if you get cut down this way or that, sword or spear, what\u8217\'92s the best thing to do to get \u8216\'91em back.\u8221\'94 The Drekkans can afford to think like that. They can afford one-for-one trades.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But Jandrians are mostly known for slings and arrows. .\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Drekk can afford twenty-for-one trades. That, and they\u8217\'92ve got these things called shields\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Anyways, the point is, it\u8217\'92s much easier to incapacitate, and then you can do what you will\u8230\'85. Eventually, if we ever get there, you\u8217\'92ll learn enough that your goal will become to simply take what your opponent gives you. Every style and stance is presenting something as a target. But for now let\u8217\'92s just say our target is the sword arm. Generally speaking, its the closest part of the enemy to your blade, it is the enemy\u8217\'92s threat, and if struck down the threat is nullified.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s three parts to an arm: the shoulder, arm, and hand.\u8221\'94 He tapped each part as he was wont to do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The hand is simple. It\u8217\'92s basically just a bundle tendons and bone. If it gets cut almost anywhere, prettymuch, then the hand goes to shit. If I can\u8217\'92t grip my sword, you\u8217\'92re going win.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The hard part about the hand is that its a small target that moves quickly. The shoulder however, is tied to the body\u8217\'92s core, and moves slowly. If I hack your shoulder here,\u8221\'94 He patted the meat of Mandri shoulder, \u8220\'93You won\u8217\'92t drop your sword, but you won\u8217\'92t be able to raise it. You\u8217\'92ll still be able to stab with it, but swinging is out of the question. So remember that: hit the shoulder and he can still stab. Of course, if you get lucky and sever the nerve here, then the whole arm goes to shit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d be lucky just to land a single blow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure, sure. I know this is a lot to take in, but these things need to be rolling around in your brain. When the time comes, you\u8217\'92ll see, the mind has a way of digging these things up. Just remember the key things at least: Sword arm,\u8221\'94 he patted his own right arm. \u8220\'93Close but fast,\u8221\'94 he held up his hand. \u8220\'93Far but slow.\u8221\'94 He held the shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about the rest of the arm?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The rest arm\u8217\'92s a funny thing. Before we get into it, we\u8217\'92ve got to touch a bit on the art of swordplay.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothing artful about killing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When I say art, I mean a way of thinking about solving problems. It\u8217\'92ll be easier to compare it to something more familiar, like music. In music there is only one thing: the single note. In painting its a single brushstroke - you take this one thing, and you put a bunch of them together to form something a more complex. In swordplay it\u8217\'92s no different. The single thing is the pose. String them together and you\u8217\'92ve got movement. It\u8217\'92s much like dance.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No it isn\u8217\'92t. I\u8217\'92ve seen women dance, and I\u8217\'92ve seen men fight. One is a planned display of beauty, the other is nothing but a rude, chaotic frenzy until one gives a brusque heave and dies.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You wouldn\u8217\'92t judge the entire art of painting from a child\u8217\'92s scribblings, would you? No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They were two lorldy princes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re point?\u8221\'94\line \tab \u8220\'93Surely they were trained in your art from the womb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you ever find yourself in a suit of armor fighting similarly armored prince, then I\u8217\'92ll be sure to give you  a lesson in that brutish form. In the meantime, you need to be thinking about it like this - thinking about the aspects of the form. In music there is melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, how loud or soft it is, and every single note of the composition affects all of these aspects simultaneously. That\u8217\'92s the important thing. If you want to compose a song, you need to be thinking about how the next note you place is going to affect not just the melody, but also the harmony, the rhythm, the texture, the loudness, and more. If you\u8217\'92re song sounds bad, and you don\u8217\'92t know the aspects of a note, you\u8217\'92re not going to be able to make your song much better. You might fiddle around for a little bit, but you won\u8217\'92t make much progress. You certainly won\u8217\'92t make anything interesting. That\u8217\'92s what this brand of thinking gives you: a framework to help you creatively solve unique problems.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m following.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Again, it\u8217\'92s the same with all art forms. You paint a painting, with every single brushstroke, you\u8217\'92re making a statement about color, about edge, value, and more. If you\u8217\'92re a painter you need to be aware of those aspects, because you\u8217\'92re going to make a bad painting, and you need you a way of thinking about it to fix it, or else you\u8217\'92re just fiddling around. It same in a fight. If you\u8217\'92re in a fight and you\u8217\'92re just fiddling around,  being \u8216\'91rude and chaotic\u8217\'92 as you say, then you\u8217\'92re going to have a bad time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s all well and good,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, \u8220\'93but I am an old, old hat. \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well let me finish now that I\u8217\'92ve gotten started.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri laughed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay. Yes, continue.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So what are the component parts of a duel? It\u8217\'92s these: distance, timing, balance, momentum, risk, and most importantly, the opposition.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Indeed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Every movement you make affects all of these things simultaneously. I take a step towards you, and I am changing the distance. I am playing with risk. I have shifted my center of balance. I am changing momentum because with this step, whatever actions come next must flow from it. After it all, perhaps during, you will react.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t possibly be thinking about all these things. Not in the middle of a duel. There\u8217\'92s no time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93These and more. Really theres no end to the aspects of any art, because after all, it\u8217\'92s all made up. Just stick with the basics, drill them, and you\u8217\'92ll be competent enough to hold your own.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can\u8217\'92t you just show me a few moves?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s an art, Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An art? I\u8217\'92m not trying to express myself here. My aim is to survive.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know. But \u8216\'91a few moves\u8217\'92 aren\u8217\'92t going to keep you alive. You need to be able to react to whatever is going on. To do that you need to be able to solve novel problems. Creativity, Mandri. Creativity is what will keep you alive. To be creative, you need to be thinking critically about what it is you\u8217\'92re doing. That\u8217\'92s what art is, that is what fighting is; creative problem solving. You need to be thinking this way and so we\u8217\'92ll practice it. Now stand up.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 My sword\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s on the line, yours isn\u8217\'92t, so I\u8217\'92ve won. But theres an easy counter, I\u8217\'92m sure you can think of it. Yes, you can simply move the sword out of the way, but you\u8217\'92re moving the sword off the line. You\u8217\'92re giving it up without me hitting it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A practiced swordsman will know all the moves, all the tricks and traps. So if you run into one, your best bet is to simply maintain a safe distance. You should run, if the mood calls for it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 How do I know if my opponent is skilled?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Oh, you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ll know in an instant whether or not your opponent knows about the line, about distance. The number of men I\u8217\'92ve killed with their sword out to the side like this, mid swing, its absurd. It\u8217\'92s like they\u8217\'92ve got this thought that if they start their swing first, that means I\u8217\'92ve got to parry it. It doesn\u8217\'92t enter their minds that I could just take a step forward, close the distance myself, and then stab them.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But if enemy know about distance, about the line, you should probably run. Everyone else, the mere fact that you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re considering it means your much more likely to win. And this is the thing about fighting - about everything really - it\u8217\'92s more about knowledge and experience than your god-given physical tools. I\u8217\'92m one of the smallest in the Ayramun, but no one here would fight me.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Keep your hand like the head of a hawk.  Always pointed towards its prey. Nomatter how the body moves, keep it pointed towards the prey.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Stab instead of slash.  Stab - less of the arm is exposed to the enemy than a slash. Stab requries less energy. Is easier to perform in tight formation as it limits possibility of wounding allies. A slash is more likely to be stopped by armor or bones, difficult to land a lethal blow. With a stab, a cut no deeper than 2 inchens can be lethal.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Stabbing saves a lot of force.}

I believe in the demiurge. I believe in the uncaused cause. It seems so strange that there should be something at all. So for me, I believe in That which lies outside the bounds of logic and reason. THere exists something which lies beyond understanding. I am certain of it\u8217\'92s existence, yet I cannot touch it. I brush against it in fever dreams. }
