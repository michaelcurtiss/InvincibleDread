\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He sat up, stretched his arms, and was surprised to find himself back in the original temple basement. How he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d gotten back after tripping on that blessed God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon, he did not know. In fact he couldn\u8217\'92t remember much of what had occurred. It was an ecstatic, frightful dream, and he knew it wasn\u8217\'92t a dream because he wasn\u8217\'92t imaginative enough to have dreamed up what those burgeons had made him see.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He closed his eyes and tried to remember.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was some kind of geometric pattern. There was the color red. There were shimmering lines of immanence extending out from his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And then\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And then\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And then he realized that he was alone in that temple basement.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He opened his eyes and sure enough not a single Ayramun was present. Not even Obo was there\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only the drifting white ash of that meager fire and the lingering smell of smoke.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri ached himself up against the wall. His sleep crusted eyes were able to filter through the dim blue light of twilight to see that the Ayramun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s packs were still there, so he hadn\u8217\'92t been left behind, only left out. He decided to climb the ladder and see if anyone was lounging around outside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He hoped someone was up there preparing a meal. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He climbed up the ladder\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rungs and as he moved the soreness in his body worked itself out quickly. Must have been the work of the God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon. He decided to ask Seb about it as soon as he got the chance\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but that would be all he he would ask about. It wouldn\u8217\'92t do any good to inquire about what exactly had happened and how Seb had managed to bring him back up into that basement. He would have to pretend to remember everything, including walking back himself, because he didn\u8217\'92t want to give Seb the impression that he couldn\u8217\'92t handle a single sliver of that beautiful God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeon, as he wanted to try them again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri pulled himself up onto the cobbled stone of the tiny temple floor. He kept calling it a temple, but there was no altar or kneeling stone\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 only that hole in the ground and the wooden ladder. There was a scrawl of Old Jandri circumscribing the inner dome, but Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t read it. He guessed it told the life of some dead desert father who\u8217\'92d died here and was buried in a crypt down below. But no one cares about dead desert men who spent their long years He shuddered at thought of someone so silly, and he stepped out into the pink evening air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The sandy dirt was still warm to the touch, but the air was cool enough to take up the journey again. As Mandri wondered why they hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t done just that he saw to his right, on top of the nearest hill, all of the Ayramun. They stood with backs turned, facing west, facing the setting sun. They were a remarkable set of outland pokes, all different sizes, and with Obo included, still strapped in his litter and leaning against Ayram\u8217\'92s leg, they ranged from the smallest person alive to the largest. Only Seb, at the end of the line, turned and regarded Mandri\u8217\'92s presence. This he did with a smirk and a wink, and Mandri felt compelled to return a smile. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri then scrambled up the hill to join the rest of them, and as soon as he arrived all schemes of stealing Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeons fled from thought, for it was not the setting sun which stretched out above the horizon. Instead there loomed in the distant west a heavy black cloud as dark as the oncoming night. This king of clouds stretched out across the world and churned it over. It could have been mistaken for rampaging herd of mountains, if such a thing were possible. And though it was dark, Mandri was struck by its color, for its upper reaches pierced the shadow of world\u8217\'92s edge and back into fleeing light day, painting it shades of golden-red he\u8217\'92d seen in the God\u8217\'92s eye trance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri gasped at the storm\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s awesome magnificence. The stunning sensation was helped along by little westwind zephyrs tickling his skin. Little had ever humbled Mandrameen, but the sight of this world-eating behemoth was enough to do it. And so far as he could tell, it was coming straight for him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Holy shit,\u8221\'94 he muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothing holy about it,\u8221\'94 Elrahet croaked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was standing next to Mandri, and he chuckled. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Big \u8216\'91ol bastard, isn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This storm was much bigger than that. This was a storm of legend, a Mukheen, a child of Muk, inheritor of His wrath, though the Sand hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t seen a storm anywhere near this size for at least one hundred years. Mandri had seen it before because the Mukheen are a favorite subject for many a landscape painter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a wall of sand rendered in lurid reds and purples reaching to the heavens, its face lit up by jagged spears of lightning. Twisting funnels swept the land before it, harbingers of its destruction, and in the foreground, a sympathetic figure\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a human, or a lonely, trembling tree\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 whose only purpose is to accentuate the sheer scale of the monster about to swallow it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri always suspected that none of these artists had actually seen such a storm with their own two eyes. They were all copying each other, and so the results were decidedly dull. What Mandri saw before him now would cause a riot if he were to put down in paint. Such a thing was too great, too evil to be real.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was as taken by the sight of the storm as everyone else.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is unnatural,\u8221\'94 he said in wonder. This was the most honest emotion Mandri had ever heard come from Obo\u8217\'92s usually guarded self. There was a seriousness in the Mazyd\u8217\'92s expression that Mandri didn\u8217\'92t think was possible.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course it\u8217\'92s natural,\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93Everything that happens is natural.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s coming from an impossible direction.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sneered around Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s figure and said derisively, \u8220\'93What would you know about it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve read every book and scroll that accounts the weather in this part of the world, and every Mukheen for the past thousand years was born abreast the Gongee Sea.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They form there because when the high Gongee winds stop blowing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 well it\u8217\'92s like taking the lid off a pot of steaming water. And the Gongee Sea is four days to the south. That\u8217\'92s not to mention that Mukheens certainly don\u8217\'92t look like }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 that}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 .\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was unimpressed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Clearly, they do look like that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you ever been caught in a Mukheen?\u8221\'94 Obo asked him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. Have you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93I never saw it coming. The first thing I knew of it was when my own dust overtook me. Then came a mist of sand, and next I was swept up in a red haze. I could walk in it. I survived it. If I\u8217\'92d been caught in a thing like }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 that}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 ,\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 she pointed to the distant storm with her gnarled walking stick, \u8220\'93then the whipping sand would have lashed the flesh from my bones. That\u8217\'92s no Mukheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram, who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been brooding, and looked like he was about to challenge the storm to a duel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This must be Pell,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Her and no one else,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93Every God who could have done it is long dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are we going to do?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We can\u8217\'92t walk with that monster runnin\u8217\'92 us down.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We stay in the hole,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet, \u8220\'93And we pray to all that is truly holy that these hills don\u8217\'92t get swallowed up by sand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That would ruin us,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93If we don\u8217\'92t keep moving, the Hrks will catch us long before reach Ullr.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s got to be another way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We could try for the Kari plain,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram shook his head and stroked his beard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Could try the Goree Pass,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Goree Pass\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Ayram muttered, his fingers twirling the tips of his beard like they were weaving a fresh idea. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Goree will never work,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It could work,\u8221\'94 said Seb. Mandri waited for the grungy man to expound upon his argument, but Seb just stood there and looked at Ayram like a dog waiting to be fed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If those demon Rigas can track the Mazyd from anywhere, then they\u8217\'92ll sense his coming and be at the Goree Pass long before we get there.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Every time Ayram pulled and twirled a tuft of his beard he puffed it back into that smooth, bread-loaf shape.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe they won\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 Ayram said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why wouldn\u8217\'92t they?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If this storm curves north once it passes, then it\u8217\'92ll get in their way and give us room.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if it doesn\u8217\'92t curve north?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then I\u8217\'92ll have to think of something else.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With that, Ayram picked Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter up, then turned and side-step-shuffled back down the hill. Moto stamped after him to fret about this change of plans. Of the rest of the Ayramun, Moteah seemed most unaffected by current events. She was standing on the hill\u8217\'92s top-most point\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a black rock which put her up a foot higher than the rest\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and she had a long reedy stick which she\u8217\'92d brought with her from that western plain and with it she drew little abstract faces and then she\u8217\'92d watch the wind brush them away grain by grain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was watching the storm looking pleased with himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, \u8220\'93We are suddenly in possession of some recreational time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb patted his pocket and what-do-you-know, there was another wink. He wandered back down the hill, but of course, Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t follow too quickly as he\u8217\'92d arouse too much suspicion. Someone would ask why he wants to a hang out with Seb and he\u8217\'92d not have a good answer because Seb was repulsive.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl was sitting next to Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rock, and she sat cross-legged, taking in the wind, squinting as she did. Her tangled brown mess of sun-kissed hair blew past her shoulders to reveal the smallest set of ears. Hers was a face that suggested deep and penetrating thought, though Mandri knew from experience that such faces were almost always a lying. Still, they were worth studying because they proved to be the most difficult to capture. It\u8217\'92s all too easy to make someone look like an idiot as eyes naturally bely nothing in particular. Most stare out at the world with the blankness of a crab, even if they look bright and beckoning. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you thinking about?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m thinking of all the ways that this is going to go wrong,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I hope I\u8217\'92m not on the list.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You aren\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 she said, and somehow that stung him, even though it was perfectly acceptably true.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Anyone else hungry?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s hardtack in my bag,\u8221\'94 said Moteah.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you have anything green?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Green? Like what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know. I\u8217\'92m in the mood for something pulled out of the earth.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl sighed and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know Mandri, you\u8217\'92re a whole lot dumber than you look.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Interesting that you should say that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah butted in by saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, do you see a single sprig of green in all of }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 that}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 ?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri glanced to the world and of course, there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a speck of green in all of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is a fair point,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 So he scrambled down the hill to go find and pester Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Unfortunately, Moto was waiting down by the temple entrance, and Mandri tried to enter he blocked Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s way with the scabbard of his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are you going?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To find snack.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No free food until you show me you can earn your keep.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He then pulled another sword out from behind him, a Hrkan short sword salvaged from the battle of Minting Rock, and he extended this out towards Mandri, hilt first, clearly expecting Mandri to pull it from its scabbard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t imagine what you\u8217\'92d want me to do with this,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93Do your nails need filing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you remember our conversation?\u8221\'94 Moto asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh right, right before I threw myself into that demon pit?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto smiled at the insinuation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was going easy on you then,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Now that you\u8217\'92re Ayramun\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 well you\u8217\'92re not Ayramun\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 now that you\u8217\'92re out here with us, you have to earn your keep. So take the goddamned sword.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri hesitated, but the man was serious. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice came ringing out of the little temple interior.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re not going to try and teach him to fight, are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to teach to fight. I\u8217\'92m going to teach him to defend himself so I don\u8217\'92t have to worry about him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Please let me watch,\u8221\'94 Obo pleaded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quiet down or I\u8217\'92ll gag you again.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me watch and you\u8217\'92ll never have to ask me to quiet down again. I swear it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If it matters,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, \u8220\'93I wouldn\u8217\'92t mind an audience. This event should be remembered by more than two. I mean, this could only ever be more embarrassing for you than me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto tossed the sword, still in its scabbard, towards Mandri, who fumbled it into the dirt. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto disappeared into the temple and marched back out with Obo still strapped to his litter. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could learn something too,\u8221\'94 Moto said to Obo. \u8220\'93And pass it on to your Hrkan Lords. For all their bluster, your Skelsi are shit fighters.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, I heard you and Ayram cut them down quite deftly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re brave enough, I\u8217\'92ll give them that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes they were. How unfortunate.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92d rather they be cowards?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In the Hrkan art of war, there\u8217\'92s no such thing as cowardice. There\u8217\'92s no such thing as bravery, either. A brave man and a cowardly man are both dead men, for bravery and cowardice are both symptoms of unpreparedness. If a soldier is ever called on to be brave, then his commander has failed him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sounds like you read that in a book.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo adopted the look of a lecturer, for he was indeed recalling some absurd holy writ of war. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Either the fighting man is fully prepared for what he faces and he wills himself towards victory, or his commander must kill himself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto walked several paces away and he drew his gold-trimmed sword with a flourish. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can be as prepared as you can possibly be, but still face bad odds. That\u8217\'92s what calls for bravery.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo continued on with his recitation. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you face unbalanced odds, then you have failed in your maneuvers and have arrived in battle unprepared, and so you should kill yourself\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 these are not my words, they are Lord Kashkan\u8217\'92s.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright, lesson number one, Mandri\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 don\u8217\'92t ever listen to a Hrk. There\u8217\'92s no maneuver that\u8217\'92s ever going to put }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  in a position where you can }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 will}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  yourself victory.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s encouraging,\u8221\'94 said Mandri sarcastically.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lesson number two is to always run away from a fight if you can.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then I\u8217\'92m practically a prodigy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No you\u8217\'92re not because you don\u8217\'92t }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 think}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , Mandri. Your mind is as undeveloped as your arm. We don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have time to sharpen either, so we\u8217\'92ve got to be smart. So let\u8217\'92s get you thinking. First, your goal. You and I are about to duel. What is it, in specific terms, you are trying to do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Survive.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Survive seems specific to me.\u8221\'94 Mandri looked to Obo for moral support. \u8220\'93I mean either I\u8217\'92m living or dead, there\u8217\'92s not much room for confusion.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would have preferred you to say run away\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s a specific action.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then I will run away.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Always run away, if you can. I\u8217\'92m not saying that because you\u8217\'92re you. If you pulled a blade on me, I\u8217\'92d run away. I\u8217\'92d kill you a hundred times out of a hundred if it came down to a fight, but I\u8217\'92d still prefer run away.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because swords are damned sharp. It doesn\u8217\'92t take much for a blade like that to find the bone, and it doesn\u8217\'92t take much for rot to find the smallest wound.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But if you beat me a hundred times out of a hundred\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A hundred times out of a hundred, yes. But a thousand times? A hundred thousand? I\u8217\'92m sure you\u8217\'92d get lucky in one or two. It\u8217\'92s a risk that\u8217\'92s not worth taking. I\u8217\'92ve seen men more skilled than Skelsi get stabbed in the belly by raw recruits. You understand?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think I need to be convinced that I should run away, so what are we doing here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In the event that you can\u8217\'92t run away, what is another specific goal you can set out for yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kill my enemy before he kills me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Again, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 think}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . Be }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 specific}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . What }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 specifically}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  are you going to do to achieve that. You must consider that most blows to the body don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t kill quickly. There\u8217\'92s only a few reliable spots that will end a fight right away. The heart,\u8221\'94 He pounded his chest. \u8220\'93And the head.\u8221\'94 He tapped his skull the blunt edge of his sword. \u8220\'93Of course you\u8217\'92ve have to consider armor in all this. If you stick a Skelsi in the arm then you\u8217\'92ve failed to kill him quickly, and now he\u8217\'92s free to have his way with you. Half a Skelsi\u8217\'92s training goes into figuring out all the different ways to get back at an enemy who\u8217\'92s in the process of killing him. If you get cut down this way or that, sword or spear, what\u8217\'92s the best thing to do to get \u8216\'91em back. The Hrks can afford to think like that. They can afford one-for-one trades.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I guess that\u8217\'92s why Outland folk are mostly known for slings and arrows,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93Speaking of which, I think I am much better suited for that sort of thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hrk can afford twenty-for-one trades,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The thought is,\u8221\'94 said Moto, \u8220\'93When fighting the Skelsi you wound and you get out of the way.\u8221\'94 To illustrate the point he cut a dramatic swath out of the air and then returned to his starting position. \u8220\'93You take what your opponent gives you. When it comes to Skelsi, what they give you is their sword arm. Your goal\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 your }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 specific}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  goal\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 is to attack their sword arm. And we can get more specific than that.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is what using your mind feels like. There\u8217\'92s three parts to an arm\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the shoulder, arm, and hand.\u8221\'94 He tapped each part as he was wont to do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The hand is a bundle tendons and bone. If it gets cut almost anywhere, then it goes to shit. Lose a finger and you can barely parry a child.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The hard part about the hand is that its a small target that moves quickly. The shoulder however, is tied to the body\u8217\'92s core, and moves slowly. If you hack the shoulder here,\u8221\'94 He patted the meat of his own shoulder, \u8220\'93You might not win the battle, but you\u8217\'92ve taken a significant step in that direction.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d be lucky to land a single blow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know this is a lot to take in, but these things need to be rolling around in your mind. You need to think about them. When the time comes, you\u8217\'92ll see, the mind has a way of remembering. Focus on the key thing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 attack the sword arm.\u8221\'94 He raised his sword arm and gave the air another few dramatic hacks, and he seemed extremely proud of his handiwork}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you live long enough you may learn something about the sublime art of killing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s nothing artful about killing,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What would you know about art?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Admittedly, not much.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All artists are trying to get at the human heart, I simply take the most direct approach.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If that\u8217\'92s all there is to it, then I\u8217\'92d be one of the greatest artists to ever live.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo looked so ridiculous, swaddled there sitting there in his litter. He looked like a dwarf stuck in the bole of a tree. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve killed more people than most. More than you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But that didn\u8217\'92t require any thought. What makes an artform is the thought that goes into it, where you have to }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 think}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to solve problems. You Mazyd open your mouths and you win\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s no effort.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You swing your sword and you win, it\u8217\'92s no different.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Please. It\u8217\'92ll be easier to compare it to something more familiar, like music. In music there is only one thing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the single note. In painting its the single brushstroke. In any form you take this one thing, and you put a bunch of them together to form a more complex whole. In swordplay it\u8217\'92s no different. The single thing here, between Mandri and myself, is the space between our blades. Reorganize the nature of this space over a period of time and you have a work of art worthy of Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen enough duels to know battle is nothing but a rude, chaotic frenzy until one gives a brusque heave and dies.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You wouldn\u8217\'92t judge the entire art of painting from a child\u8217\'92s scribblings, would you? Those men were flailing about, it\u8217\'92s much the same. I doubt they\u8217\'92d ever considered the different aspects of the form. In music there is melody, harmony, rhythm, texture, loudness and softness, and }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 every single note }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 of the song affects all of these aspects simultaneously\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s the important thing, a single note is doing so many things at once. If you want to compose a song, you need to be thinking about how the next note you place is going to affect not only the melody, but also the harmony, the rhythm, the texture, and so on. If your song sounds horrible, and you don\u8217\'92t know the all the aspects of a note, you\u8217\'92re not going to be able to make an intelligent decision about how to improve your song. You might fiddle around for a little bit, but you won\u8217\'92t make much progress. You certainly won\u8217\'92t make anything interesting.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 By now he was talking to Mandri, and had evidently forgotten that there was some point in his own defense he was trying to make. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think about the space between my blade and yours, and you think about how the mechanics of how our bodies influence that space. A single movement is like a single note in a song. I make one step\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He hopped to the side. This was two steps, though Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t hold it against him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One step and I affect all the aspects of a battle\u8217\'92s composition\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 distance, timing, balance, momentum, risk, line, and most importantly, the impression you have of my intentions. And again, it\u8217\'92s the same with all art forms. A single brushstroke is a statement about color, edge, value, and more.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a painter?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I could be if I wanted to,\u8221\'94 Moto said dismissively. \u8220\'93I have the mind for it, which is to say that I use my mind, unlike so many others.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would think that in a fight, strength and agility matter more than how much you think about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Physical differences only come into play when the minds are matched.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri thought he sniffed , but Obo was the one to pounce.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo asked Moto, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who would win in a fight between you and Ayram?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The answer was obvious, yet Moto could not of course admit it. , as if it were the most difficult question in the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The answer depends on too many things,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s not enough context.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The context is you versus Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face went through such a series of contortions that he could have charged money to see the act. Somewhere in there was the suggestion that it was offensive to even ask the question. A few shades of disappointment as well, like who were Mandri and Obo to wonder about things beyond their comprehension? Finally though, Moto relented. He said, \u8220\'93More times than not, Ayram would win.\u8221\'94 And that was the end of the lesson. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri hauled Obo down into the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly, munched on a wafer of hardtack, and they waited for the storm to overtake them, which it did in no time at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 First came the tremendous sound of the vanguard sand howling, almost screaming. Every now and then a gust of wind would blow through the temple entrance and swirl around inside, and as it did, it blew though the hole in floor turning the belly and tunnel into a sort of flute\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the resultant sound was a whistling whine that sounded startlingly similar to the labored fits of a pregnant dog.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As the wind intensified, its whine steadied into a droll hum, a sound so annoying that all the Ayramun retreated deep into the tunnel to get some sleep. Only Mandrameen and Obo stayed in the ladder room to tend the small twiggy fire. Obo was only there because no one could be bothered to pick him up and move him. Mandri stayed because he was mesmerized by the sight and sound of the building storm. Being so near to such an awesome power was intoxicating.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He asked Obo, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How long do you think I could last up there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Exposed, you would die in minutes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stepped up to the ladder. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you trying to kill yourself?\u8221\'94 Obo asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I just want to see what it feels like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It will feel like torture.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri continued on up the ladder despite the warning, and when he got to the top, he stuck his hand up to test the fury. Sand blasted his palm like a hundred bee stings, and he hissed in pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He hobbled back down, staring at his prickled hand. Red welts the size of ant bites dotted it, their centers bleeding red. He sat near the fire and moaned, but he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t regret it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t believe they\u8217\'92re trying to kill Solraheen,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93If He could make this storm, then just imagine the kind of power He has.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen didn\u8217\'92t make this storm,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93As I\u8217\'92m sure you are aware, He is incapacitated at the moment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He might not have made this particular storm, but He made\u8230\'85 you know\u8230\'85 he made the structure for it. He made the world that made it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your faith is profound.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well He\u8217\'92s the only true creator. When artists work, we\u8217\'92re only moving things around. Like Moto was saying earlier about swordplay, you know, that bullshit about movement. And a painter just moves paint around. None of it is real creation. But Solraheen, he created the wind, he created the Sand, and from these, he created this storm.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could look at it like that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And why would anyone want to kill a being that could do that? That kind of creativity is the only thing that makes life worth living.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was feeling philosophical. All that was missing was the beer. A nice freeweed wrap would do as well.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everyone thinks that because I don\u8217\'92t have a Spark, that means I\u8217\'92m incapable of belief. But I do believe in something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 "And what is that?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I believe that there exists a thing which lies outside the bounds of reason, beyond your understanding and even mine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo, you\u8217\'92re clever, but not that clever.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You might call it God, the Demiurge, the Uncaused Cause\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 I am not certain of it\u8217\'92s existence, but I }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 believe}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  that it is there, because even without a Spark I can see the bottom of it.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The bottom of what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you ever considered how everything would make so much more sense if nothing existed at all?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh please, Obo, don\u8217\'92t start.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A pure sea of nothingness makes so much more sense. A void, with no people, no Sparks, no Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re boring me. I\u8217\'92ve heard enough of Moto\u8217\'92s bullshit to bear any from you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri got up and fashioned some pillows out of what packs had been left in the room. He gave a quick look for Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack, because a drop of God\u8217\'92s Eye would significantly improve the moment, but of course Seb had expected this and brought his pack along with him. Mandri was forced, against his will, to lay there sober and watch the hole and listen to raging of the storm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He could hear the sand scratching at the bricks of the temple.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He could hear excited whispers coming from the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hand after hand passed like this, and all the while the winds outside were rising. His thoughts turned to children\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stories, the ones about the named Mukheen. This storm was greater than them all\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the king of all Mukheen. Hide the women, for as it passes it may fill their wombs. Beware the cough that can kill as vast quantities of sand are unavoidably inhaled. Feel it strip the air of moisture, feel its heat sear the lungs. Mandri heard its hiss and rumble, but the one thing he hadn\u8217\'92t seen was the snap and crack of lightning leaping from every surface. The stories were clear on that\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the air should come alive with static. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But all he had to do was wait. The heat increased until it felt as hot as an oven, and just as he could no longer bear it he moved to wipe the sweat from brow and his fingertips conjured there a shocking spark.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He yelped in surprise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your hair looks ridiculous,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri reached up and roughly half the hairs on his head were standing on end. But his excitement at this electric thrill was tempered by the sound of rock sliding atop rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo seemed unconcerned. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The wind is lifting the dome,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Should we be in here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would say that we should be fine, but my forecasts have been wrong of late.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri repositioned his makeshift cot as far away from the hole as room allowed, shocking himself several times as he did. Soon an especially loud howl of wind kicked a gout of sizzling sand into the temple above, and along with it came a roar which tumbled the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s walls in on itself once and for all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sand poured down through the hole, but it was quickly plugged by a glut of bricks. One last wisp of sand puffed out\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the sad, dying breath of another Old Jandri relic. }}
