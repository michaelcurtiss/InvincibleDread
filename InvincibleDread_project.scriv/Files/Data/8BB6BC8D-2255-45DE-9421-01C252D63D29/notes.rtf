Sometimes, the reality is its got nothing to do with the person we talking about. Someties its about whats going on around you. Sometimes whats going on around you buys you time, sometimes it chews up your time. I think thats why we got to come with an edge every day, because thats something you don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know. You aint completely in control of.
