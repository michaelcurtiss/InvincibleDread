\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 That over there is chopper.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Chop!?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 No! No chop. No chop today.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Aw.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Don\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t say the word chop around chopper. Unless you need something chopped. And if you need something chopped you better find him and let him do it or else he\u8217\'92ll chop you.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Not many of us left since yesterday.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man walking in front of Mandri, the rude, scraggly man who carried the \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91unconscious\u8217\'92 Mazyd Obo, his name was Seb. The man walking behind Mandri, the short and stout man who carried the torch, his name was Hill, and according to Hill, these were the only two things that Mandri needed to know. Don\u8217\'92t bother with \u8216\'91why\u8217\'92, or \u8216\'91what is going on\u8217\'92, or \u8216\'91I can\u8217\'92t see where I\u8217\'92m going\u8217\'92, no, the only thing that mattered was that Seb was in front and Hill was behind and that was the way things were going to be. If Mandri did so much as breathe too loud for Hill\u8217\'92s comfort, well that was sufficient cause for an open handed smack on the back of the head, and it was impossible to not breathe hard because sound carried well in that pitch-black tunnel. And Mandri\u8217\'92s once-dead-legs were as stiff as rods so every step begged a groan. Every time he bent his knees it felt like his thighs were ripping apart. Instead of striding through the dark like Hill wanted him to, Mandri shuffled through it on sensitive feet, doing what he could to avoid the trash that littered the floor, and that was hard to do too because the tunnel was a dumping ground. There was a horde of trash piled all the way up the low ceiling, not a place for unshod feet. Picked-clean bones of small animals, splintered balkanut shells the size of skulls, curved clay shards of shattered jars, and all manner of organic waste, the worst of which were the cold and gooey lumps of muck that glistened when they welled up in between Mandri\u8217\'92s toes\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t sure it was shit until Hill stepped in it, too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Godsdamned it be! Seb, was this you?\u8221\'94 Hill was pointing down at dark stain on the bottom of his hard leather boot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Course not,\u8221\'94 Seb protested.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why can\u8217\'92t you shit in the hole like everyone else?\u8221\'94 Hill asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I told you, it wasn\u8217\'92t me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s always you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was Chopper.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill let loose a long a frustrated sigh and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s always either you or Chooper, and this ones a little green, so that means its you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It wasn\u8217\'92t me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb shot right back, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And who\u8217\'92s the one puttin\u8217\'92 all this trash up in here, huh? Ya know there\u8217\'92s a pit for all this, too, but ya too lazy, ain\u8217\'92t ya? Everyone is. You wanna take it out me? No. Get yourself together fore you come and pick on }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 my}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  habits.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb wrapped up his harangue with a snort and then turned back towards the darkness, readjusting Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dead weight on his shoulders as he went. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then he set off once again, dragging his right foot in the dirt as he went so as to scrape the shit off it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This tunnel was the most loathsome place that Mandri had ever seen, but that didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t mean it was a corridor of Shis. Sure, it was grimy, had shit on the floor, was cramped, and not one thing in it was whole, yet with each step Mandri was becoming more and more certain that this }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 wasn\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92t}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  truly Shis. This was life in all it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lived-in-ness, and Mandri could think of no surer a sign of plenty than a deep trash heap. But maybe every nation\u8217\'92s trash found its way down to Shis as a kind of punishment that the dead must bear for not cleaning up after themselves. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t until the trio left this rubbish tunnel and spilled out into a roomier tunnel that Mandri was sure\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this was the regular old world. It was still dark and foreboding, but the objects that lay strewn around the pale rock floor were too banal to be . One side was a store of chopped lumber, and stacked cross-wise on the other were plump bags of grain. Flat surface was crowded with empty cots and  , even charcoal markings on the walls, Then this dark passage emptied out into a bigger one, where the ceiling was twice Mandri\u8217\'92s height. Mandri steeled himself against the pain in his legs, rubbed his foot in the dirt to wipe the shit off it, and then did his best to keep up with Seb who was finding his way through the dark like he\u8217\'92d placed each shattered piece of pot himself. More stuff.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He truly had been brought back to life.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It remained to be seen if this was positive development.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At the very least it was an interesting development.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure which was more interesting, that he\u8217\'92d been raised from the dead, or that these ratty bandits had somehow captured a Mazyd. The Mazydai were beings of storied power, cornerstones of Hrkan Lordship, yet there was Mazyd Obo, limp and shoulder-slung like a freshly slaughtered sty-pig. It was hard to believe anyone could bring a Mazyd down so low, and that these two ratty bandits were involved was inconceivable. Seb was as unimposing as an outland man could be, dirty and hungry looking, with sunken eyes. He looked like desperation more than a man, and desperation you could defeat by simply looking away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri snuck a look behind at Hill. Hill had his plump pinky finger stuck halfway up his own nose, digging for gold.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Leave some for me,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill eye\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s flashed in surprise and he gave Mandri a rude but pulled punch in the ribs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get going!\u8221\'94 he shouted, and Mandri got going. He took two steps, and when that wasn\u8217\'92t hurried enough, Hill kicked out at his heels, as if that would help. Mandri\u8217\'92s stiff legs couldn\u8217\'92t cope with the unbalancing, and he tumbled forward into Seb\u8217\'92s hips. Seb went sprawling, and so did Mazyd Obo.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb gave Mandri a hard shove that sent Mandri sprawling back against Hill\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s, sending them both tumbling to the ground. Mazyd Obo, who\u8217\'92d been content to ride Hill\u8217\'92s shoulder, had his unconscious ruse upset by the sudden lurch. He yelped and went tumbling along with the others, splaying his elbows out to brace his fall, careful to keep his bandages out of the dirt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whore\u8217\'92s breath!\u8221\'94 Seb shouted. \u8220\'93You a pokey ole tacko, ain\u8217\'92t ya?!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb waddled back to his feet and then turned towards Hill and said in the most matter-of-fact tone, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a got-damned idiot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill brandished the torch towards the trio in a state of alarm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shit!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri, . Obo was gone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked after Hill, and just beyond him was the bald, pale, and naked Obo fleeing into the darkness, fleeing with exceptional agility too, leaping from rock to rock. Hill was, losing. He stopped briefly to shout, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go get Ayram!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb drew a long knife that was hidden under his cloak an}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you think about tryin\u8217\'92 nothin\u8217\'92 stupid.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Darkness.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now get movin\u8217\'92!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where?\u8221\'94 Mandri retorted through clenched teeth. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri, still half-blind and stumbling, tried to shrug off Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get movin\u8217\'92 or I\u8217\'92ll shove this thing down your throat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri let himself be pulled, half blind and stumbling, }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At the end of this larger tunnel, some fifty meters away, the tunnel gave way to the blinding light of day. One quick glance at this spot of sunlight was enough to imprint a white circle into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s vision, blinded out into the sun. They\u8217\'92d made it out of the cave when a warmth wash over skin. Seb let go of his arm, and Mandri sank to his knees, buring them in sand. He dug his hands into it. It was so damn comfortable. He wanted to dive into it like an arrow lizard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked up and squinted at a blob of warm shadow towering up in front of him. He blinked out his confusion in quick order\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 circling around him were walls of sheer vertical limestone rising up a good thirty feet to enclose a pit of orange sand. The rising sun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s light angled down the sides of this colossal white limestone bucket, leaving half the pit in a dusty, radiant glow, and the other half in a shadow which seemed to glow from all the reflected light that bounced around the pit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There were dark figures milling about in this warm shadow, some standing, some sitting against the rock. Seb called out to them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I need Ayram,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ayram\u8217\'92s not here.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is he then?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s back inside with Elrahet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb dashed back into the darkness of the tunnel, leaving Mandri in the sun alone, spotlighted against the sand, he on one side, the shadow of bandits on the other. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see their eyes, but he could feel their glares descend upon him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One of them stepped forward and into the sunlight\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a Zosan woman. Her smooth, dark face was framed by a white linen scarf that was loosely wrapped around her head and neck. The rest of her figure was shrouded to the ankles by a beige burnoose. It was a clean and simple look, and despite the wear and tear that spoke of life out in the Sand, the lady wore it with a hint of regal bearing\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she held her shoulders in a kind of self-important sweep that showed she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d trained in the art of woman-standing-still. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Her voice was almost as imperious as her uncompromising stare. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re the dead boy,\u8221\'94 she said. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yes, Mandri was the dead boy. It was such a simple matter of fact, but the way she said it made it seem like it was some keen insight that was obvious only to her. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And who are you?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked. He was anxious not to appear too ruffled. He narrowed his eyes and sat back on his heels and contemplated standing up but decided against it because it wouldn\u8217\'92t look good if he wobbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am Moteah.\u8221\'94 She said with the same degree of , like this, too, was a revelation. She wrinkled her nose as she looked down at Mandri. She could no doubt smell the death on him. Then she made a show of shaking some thought out of her head, and said, \u8220\'93That man who brought you out here-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, Seb. Do you know why he was so hasty?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh, well\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Should he nod? \u8220\'93I think your other prisoner escaped.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazydai escaped?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The word was hardly out of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mouth when three scraggly men, all wrapped up in deep desert fashion, leapt to their feet and sprinted across the sand towards Mandri. In five strides they brushed right past him, and on the sixth they disappeared into the dark tunnel, leaving behind cloud of sparkling dust swirling in the entrance light.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah held her arms up before anyone else could follow. The loose sleeves of her burnoose .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All the while her eyes were fixed on Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93As for you\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri is like, fuck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look like a rat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A few chuckles chorused out of the pit\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What were you doing in the Junei hills?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Junei?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah waved Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s confusion away and turned towards the shadowed side of the pit to address her fellow Ayramun. Her voice rang out louder now so that everyone was sure to hear. \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no reason to treat this one here any differently than any other.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A rattled old voice shouted out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93At least not till Ayram has sussed him out!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So show him respect until-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A grumbling voice shot of out of the dark. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Show him a dog\u8217\'92s dick, I will!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The crassness. Put up with this. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not till Ayram has sussed him out, you won\u8217\'92t!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She looked up to the rim of the pit and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you hear that, Sonny?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A disappointed voice echoed down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, yeah.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah puffed herself up and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I shouldn\u8217\'92t have to say this to you all, but thing\u8217\'92s being what they are\u8230\'85 No one touches a hair on his head unless Ayram says so.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She gestured wide towards Mandri. A few unconvinced grunts followed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now,\u8221\'94 Moteah said, continuing to address the shadows, \u8220\'93Who has Papi\u8217\'92s clothes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 No one answered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah stamped her foot. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The boy needs proper clothes before we set out and Papi\u8217\'92s clothes will fit. So, who took them?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Papi\u8217\'92s been not been dead two days.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you think he cares what happens to his clothes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I care.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you take his clothes, then, Pelt?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. Tob did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah head turned to the right. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tob, Do you have Papi\u8217\'92s clothes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 No one answered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah turned towards Mandri and motioned for him to follow her into the shade, and so he did.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Tucked right inside the bottom swerve of the pit\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s crescent shadow was a burly man stretched out amongst a couple burlap sacks. This man\u8217\'92s head could be best described as a wiry bush of black, for between the beard, brows, and hair there was hardly a splotch of skin. There was a mouth in there somewhere, because sticking out of it was a smoking pipe of freeweed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man, Tob, was propped up on one elbow. He took one look at Mandri and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The bastard can freeze and burn for all I care.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah introduced Mandri to this irascible bush of a man with a sigh. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is Tob,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob grunted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tob is an idiot,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come off it,\u8221\'94 Tob moaned.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are those Papi\u8217\'92s clothes?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked as she pointed to the bundle of clothes against which Tob was leaning.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob patted the bundle with care and said. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They are. Make a nice pillow, don\u8217\'92t they. The only way the boy here is gettin\u8217\'92 them is if Ayram commands it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Give them here,\u8221\'94 said Moteah, undeterred. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Woman. What did I just say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You want to explain to Ayram why the boy isn\u8217\'92t ready to go when he gets out here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine. Alright.\u8221\'94 he moaned.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob sat up and made to undo the string wrapping the bundle of clothes under neath him, grumbling as he did it. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know, last I checked was was the Ayramun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s your point.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob gave up trying to undo a troublesome knot. He tossed the wrapped bundle of clothes at Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet and said, \u8220\'93Go on. But you need be remembering who those clothes belong to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve heard,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re Papi\u8217\'92s.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94 Tob scowled. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re Ayram\u8217\'92s.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked from Tob to Moteah in confusion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everything is Ayram\u8217\'92s here. Clothes on my back. Those clothes there at your feet. The food that\u8217\'92s coming to your belly. It\u8217\'92s all loaned out, if you like. Everything\u8217\'92s Ayram\u8217\'92s, not yours, and not Moteah\u8217\'92s either. So don\u8217\'92t get confused by the way Moteah act.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri picked up the bundle. He pulled at the plaited hemp string and unrolled the clothes onto the ground. He picked out a few items that looked comfortable. There was a thin brown woolen robe that was crumpled with salt and sweat, and some loose fitting pants, brown, with a diamond pattern of beige sewn down the sides. There was also a pair of rawhide boots that, when he put them on, seemed cut perfectly to size. It was all in good shape, too, though the shirt had a blood stain around the collar and the the sleeves were a little ragged at the wrists. Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t complain though.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When finally had it all on, Tob looked him up and down with a peculiar stare and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what Papi wore when he got killed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri felt a chill run through his bones.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob started grabbing up the clothes the clothes }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know. I don\u8217\'92t know if I\u8217\'92m comfortable wearing this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob nodded. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Like the woman said, Papi\u8217\'92s dead. He don\u8217\'92t want em.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Stares of death from other Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know. It seems, uh, it seems a bit rude to be wearing these.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ain\u8217\'92t it, though?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah reassured him. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s fine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked down at the bloodstained sleeves. He wondered if this was some kind of joke. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Really, I\u8217\'92m fine wearing that old blue tunic,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s nothing wrong with what you\u8217\'92re wearing,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hell of a lot wrong with those.\u8221\'94 Tob said. Mandri was looking at him all concerned so Tob clarified. \u8220\'93Those clothes have got bad luck knitted right into them, don\u8217\'92t they?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tob, don\u8217\'92t get started,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This ain\u8217\'92t a matter of startin\u8217\'92 and stoppin\u8217\'92. Those clothes are plain bad luck. That\u8217\'92s how it is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah groaned and }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob looked towards Mandri and whispered like Moteah wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t standing right there and could hear. \u8220\'93Women don\u8217\'92t know about luck, do they?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Another Ayramun, a thin, wiry woman sitting nearby, piped up. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tob, you don\u8217\'92t know shit about luck because you ain\u8217\'92t got any.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wrong!\u8221\'94 Tob said, clearly sore about being interrupted. Talking to those in general. About ten of em. Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t counting. \u8220\'93She\u8217\'92s wrong because there\u8217\'92s no such thing as \u8216\'91no luck\u8217\'92. There\u8217\'92s only good luck and bad luck. No luck at all is just bad luck.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah rolled her eyes and said, voice thick with derision, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tob knows all about luck, don\u8217\'92t you Tob.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Damn right I do,\u8221\'94 Tob said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob reached down into a leather pack at his side and took from it a round pouch the size of his fist. He loosed the string that kept it closed and revealed to Mandri an assortment of rocks and pebbles. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take one of my rocks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The wiry woman nearby was. She was looking all surprised.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shutup Forty.\u8221\'94 Back to Mandri. \u8220\'93These are lucky rocks, boy. Count yourself blessed. Small measures of luck, but they do in a pinch. They won\u8217\'92t balance out them clothes, but it\u8217\'92s a step.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do you know they\u8217\'92re lucky rocks?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked as he looked over the stones with a skeptical eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The fact that Mandri was expressing doubt seemed offensive to him, and so Tob drew out his frustration with a sneer. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92ve been tested. And if I say they\u8217\'92ve been tested, they\u8217\'92ve been tested.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tested how?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You dumb?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do you test anything? You pick it up, try to do somethin\u8217\'92 with it, then see what happens. If it works, good chance the thing is lucky. If it works ten times over, then its been tested.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I keep the unlucky rocks, too,\u8221\'94 Tob continued. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re not as good as a curse pot, but if someone gets to pesterin\u8217\'92 you, slip one of these bad boys into their pocket.\u8221\'94 Tob then took another pouch from out of his things, and opened it to reveal another bunch of rocks. Each of these had a white \u8216\'91X\u8217\'92 carved into them. Tob picked one of them up and smiled at Moteah while he thumbed it\u8217\'92s grooves.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Little stones of retribution. Ever seen one of these babies, Moteah?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t say anything back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The older woman, Forty, .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t listen to him. It\u8217\'92s all bullshit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Woman, \u8220\'93}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay, Tob, how does luck move from a thing to a person? How\u8217\'92s it \u8216\'91balance out\u8217\'92? Does luck rub off like paint?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t get him started,\u8221\'94 Moteah said, but Forty\u8217\'92s question had hooked Tob with ease.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s like a flow of energy. But there\u8217\'92s mechanics to it. There\u8217\'92s little quirks you got to learn by experience. Like you may wonder why I was restin\u8217\'92 my head on Papi\u8217\'92s clothes, considerin\u8217\'92 they\u8217\'92re unlucky. I do it because when your sleepin\u8217\'92, unlucky things will drain the un-luck out of ye, and good luck things will drain the good luck out of you. But that\u8217\'92s only when you\u8217\'92re sleepin\u8217\'92. \u8216\'91Cause when we\u8217\'92re sleeping we become like rocks. Like how if you\u8217\'92re awake in a river you sink, but if you sleep you float like log.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94 Mandri wondered aloud.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You ever try swimming while sleeping?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh...no.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well you can\u8217\'92t. When we\u8217\'92re awake and moving about and decidin\u8217\'92 things, it\u8217\'92s the normal mechanics of luck and things rub off onto you. But like I say, there\u8217\'92s quirks to it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Interesting.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ain\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Forty snorted. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s putting you on, Tob,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Forty. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at him,\u8221\'94 she said, pointing to Tob. \u8220\'93Tob\u8217\'92s the unluckiest bastard I\u8217\'92ve ever met. He hides his face in hair cause it\u8217\'92s so damned ugly. Oh, he doesn\u8217\'92t mind. He knows he\u8217\'92s ugly as hell. Guess how he got those scars.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The man was swallowed by an Keenkedra.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But I survived! Who you know that survived the stomach of a full-grown Keenki? Who you ever }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 hear}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  about do it? No one. None but me because I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92m lucky.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lucky to have survived? Sure. Unlucky as balls to ever get swallowed in the first place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But that\u8217\'92s just the thing!\u8221\'94 Tob said, left eye wide with excitement. His right hadn\u8217\'92t moved. \u8220\'93You need some bad luck to really know about luck. It\u8217\'92s the always-lucky that don\u8217\'92t know a thing about luck because they don\u8217\'92t need to. They putter around, never steppin\u8217\'92 in any holes, and so they think that holes don\u8217\'92t exist. Never trust a lucky man\u8217\'92s ways. But someone like me, I\u8217\'92ve stepped in all the holes, I know my way around them by now. I\u8217\'92ve got Luck mapped out as well as anybody who ever lived.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no real thing as luck,\u8221\'94 Moteah countered. \u8220\'93And if there is, you certainly don\u8217\'92t know about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob turned to Mandri to plead his case. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Son, if I shoot an arrow at you, what says whether or not it kills you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri knew that Tob was fishing for answer, so he gave it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s luck.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah interjected. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Luck has nothing to do with it. It\u8217\'92s skill.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s luck!\u8221\'94 Tob retorted. \u8220\'93Skill says whether or not you hit the target. Aim at the neck, and if you\u8217\'92re skilled, you hit the neck. Luck says whether it hits a vein or the meat of the muscle.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No one walks away from a shot in the neck,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you call this, then?\u8221\'94 Tob replied. He brushed up his beard reveal a long white scar that wrapped round the left side of his neck. \u8220\'93Arrow that did this was shot from just twenty paces. Right through the neck. A mercenary from the Isle of Screte, no less; as skilled as any here with a bow. But the arrow as unlucky. The archer, unlucky. Couldn\u8217\'92t beat my luck, and half my luck is these stones. I\u8217\'92d wager more than money that my stones is what saved me. Like Forty says, my natural luck is shit. It\u8217\'92s only cause of these stones that I\u8217\'92m here talking to you know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright then,\u8221\'94 Forty said. \u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s make a bet. Let me \u8216\'91test\u8217\'92 one of your lucky stones\u8217\'92\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know I don\u8217\'92t bet,\u8221\'94 Tob said.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Tob said, eager to move on before Moteah could press the issue. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go on, take one of my stones. I don\u8217\'92t know what or who you are, but that Tob gave you a gift.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Actually, I was thinking that I want to get some experience myself.\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93Like you say, I should learn the quirks. I think I\u8217\'92ll just pick up a stone off the ground, then test it, like you say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face lit up. At least, the left side of it did. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s good! That\u8217\'92s the spirit!\u8221\'94 Between his exlamations, Tob\u8217\'92s nose wiggled and WRM.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stepped over to the cave wall and pulled a little white shard of rock from it. He chose that particular piece because it flaked out from the rest of the sandstone. It was shaped like a short, fat, carrot, fitting quite comfortably in his palm. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Odd choice.\u8221\'94 Tob said. \u8220\'93I go for smaller, rounder stones cause they\u8217\'92re easier to accumulate. But how\u8217\'92s your natural luck? Naked as you came, how unlucky are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know, it\u8217\'92s hard to say. Sometimes good, sometimes bad.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should find that out, no? But Hill\u8217\'92s cloak is strong, I\u8217\'92ve seen it in action. It should keep you nice and balanced. Keep in mind, though, it takes time to get a feel fer these kind o\u8217\'92 things. You shouldn\u8217\'92t be expectin\u8217\'92 quick results.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stuffed his new stone into his pocket. Then he pointed at Tob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pouch of rocks. \u8220\'93What if Ayram wanted those?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob cocked his ear. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, they\u8217\'92re not your rocks, right? They\u8217\'92re Ayram\u8217\'92s. You said everything was Ayram\u8217\'92s.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob glared at Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now why would you want to know about that?\u8221\'94 he asked.}

So you just worry bout your rocks and I\u8217\'92ll worry bout mine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I warned you not to get him started,\u8221\'94 Moteah muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get me started?\u8221\'94 Tob said in offense. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not started. I\u8217\'92m just tryin to keep the boy focused on what\u8217\'92s he needs to be focused on, and that\u8217\'92s his own damned luck.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright, alright,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, trying to calm Tob down. \u8220\'93What should I do then? How should I test my new rock?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you want to do?\u8221\'94}
