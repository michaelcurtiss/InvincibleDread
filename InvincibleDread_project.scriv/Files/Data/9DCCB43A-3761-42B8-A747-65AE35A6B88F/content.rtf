\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Many people struggle against attempts to define who they are, but for artists, artists in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s vein, wriggling out people\u8217\'92s expectations is something of a state of nature. People couldn\u8217\'92t tell him who he was or what he was good at. He\u8217\'92d only listen to himself, and what he\u8217\'92d say, just as he said now while sitting there on the sand, is this: }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And for any artist who takes themselves seriously, that belief is almost a practical necessity, especially for someone chasing skill. Mandri knew that if he ever started to think that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d become a master of the craft, he\u8217\'92d be finished. He\u8217\'92d stop growing. He\u8217\'92d stop getting better. True mastery, in principle, is impossible to achieve, for mastery implies that everything is known, everything is considered, and the objectively decision has been found. Absurd. There is always something unknown. The truth, as Mandri saw it, was that every artist, every person, is a blur of both mastery and ignorance; some more of one, some more of the other, and the frustrating thing about that blur is that it moves. And that is what a human being is, a blur of movement. Mandri\u8217\'92s portraits could never do it justice.}}
