If he had known such a thing was possible then perhaps he would have guessed that the staticky prickling at the edge of his mind was the Spark reasserting its grip on his body. The Old Jandri word for this final stage of reanimation, this sublime sensation, is \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91Sheldruub', which is the same word ascribed to the wild slosh of ocean foam that gets beached during a world storm. Such storms can blanket an entire coast six feet deep with salty pale-brown spume. When the storm eventually passes and the sun shines down, the air becomes saturated with the hiss of an uncountable number of bubbles popping through the course of days. The noise is not loud, it\u8217\'92s simply there and it is everywhere, a sound whose source can\u8217\'92t be placed and so it becomes something like the wind, a force of nature, hardly noticed except for when it disappears, and when it does there comes the memory of solid ground\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 though the ground is not the same as it once was for the storm has ravaged it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Mandrameen didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t notice the Sheldruub as his mind slid back into being. He didn\u8217\'92t notice the feeling of his own blood pumping through his veins and tickling his insides. He didn\u8217\'92t notice these things because he was afraid, and he was afraid because he thought he was dead and that this was the afterlife and that he was a cold corpse floating in a black void. The signs, he thought, were unmistakable. His very bones felt frigid and his whole face was numb, if it was there at all. There was the unmistakable putrescence of rotting flesh. Mandri knew the smell so well because when he was a child, rats liked to die under his floor. He\u8217\'92d have to endure the smell or sleep outside, but the first night Mandrameen slept outside the spawn of gilt flies got to him. When he woke up the left half of his face was covered in hard, red welts the size of fingernails; the other half had been safely nestled in his pillow, so he looked like he\u8217\'92d been slapped in the face by disease. The only real}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1  }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 option was to endure the smell, and endure it he did. This is not to say that he got accustomed to it. The smell of rot was always upsetting, especially now, because, presumably, that smell was coming from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And he could the not move. Dead things do not move, therefore, he was dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yet, he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 could}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  breathe, and dead things do not breathe. His breath was icy coming out of his throat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He tried again to move but neither his legs nor arms would bend. In truth, he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure if he had legs or arms at all, for he couldn\u8217\'92t truly feel them. There was only a general chill where his legs and arms should be. And just as he was coming to terms with the idea that his mind had been decoupled from his flesh and that all these sensations were but phantom memories and that his consciousness was floating somewhere inside his decomposing corpse, his eyes opened. They didn\u8217\'92t open far for they\u8217\'92d been glued shut by the crust of death, and Mandri closed them again as soon as he realized what was happening. He didn\u8217\'92t want to see the afterlife until he\u8217\'92d properly prepared for it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he finally opened his eyes again he was confronted with a low sandstone ceiling directly above him, a ceiling stained black with soot and this dark surface flickered in a meager firelight. It was a natural stone, a familiar texture where the rocky surface was smooth and craggy and porous all at once\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a difficult thing to capture with a brush. It was a surface unmarred by the clawing rake of chisels, and so it was clear that this was no tomb, or mineshaft, or one of those rock-hewn hermit homes that pock the Zagros. A cave such as this, Mandri surmised, could only mean that he had been borne down to Shis. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His eyes flicked about, and he saw that the cramped walls of the cave bulged out in places and disappeared into pitch-blackness in others.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Surely, this was Shis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quite match the popular stories\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Shis was said to be a giant pit under the earth in which a mountain-sized tornado of fire swept up the dead and raked their flailing bodies against white-hot spikes of iron embedded in the pit\u8217\'92s walls. Somehow this process cleansed the individual\u8217\'92s Spark of any pollutants. There were other, less popular, visions of Shis. There was one fresco in the city of Frum which matched what Mandri\u8217\'92s vision neatly. In this version of Shis, the dead are sequestered away deep underground in bubbles of rock. Those who repent of their sins are free to waste away, while those whose sins are too great to be forgiven suffer a different fate. Their caves become profane cocoons in which the tainted Sparks morph the flesh into some species of lizard, or, for more severe sins, they become outright demons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri closed his eyes and conjured up an image of the dark earth riddled with pockets of air like this one, each one occupied by a waking corpse like him, each person forced to endure the mire of their own stench for odd eternity. He found it pleasant. He wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be bothered. No obligations. Since he was already dead, he didn\u8217\'92t have to worry about food.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he opened his eyes again he found he had the full use of his neck. He looked down at his body and saw that he was wrapped tight in a brown woolen blanket, and he lay flat on a bed of straw. He thought it was strange for place such as Shis to provide simple comforts. He looked to his left, to the source of light, and was surprised to see that it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a tongue of fire piping up from the bowels of the earth. It was, instead, a small flame dancing on a wick which bathed in a shallow clay tallow bowl. This dish sat in the middle of the floor, and its scant yellow light was just enough to illuminate a pale creature who lay slumped on its side on the opposite side of the cave.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a humanlike, smaller than Mandri and naked, looking like something between a scrawny pubescent with gangly proportions and a hairless, wingless bat. In truer light the thing might not seem so ghoulish, but in the yellow dimness it most resembled a mangy, jaundiced dog huddled up against the world. Its deathly pale skin was obscured all around by streaks of crusty mud. This creature was so skinny that its stringy tendons were almost as large as its muscles, and its deeply furrowed ribs shuddered with its every breath. Its stomach was grossly distended, and its narrow shoulders seem naturally hunched . Mandri supposed the creature was a \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91him\u8217\'92, but he wasn\u8217\'92t sure, for its groin was completely smooth and lacked any sign of gender. But \u8216\'91he\u8217\'92 and \u8216\'91she\u8217\'92 makes no difference when the subject in question was a demon, and that\u8217\'92s what Mandri thought this creature was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This was sensible conclusion because, despite the creature\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s deformities, its face was smooth and fair, even handsome, replete with a serene expression couched in generic Hrkan features\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 thin lips and sad eyes, all in symmetrical and genderless proportion. Its dark eyes were studying a grievous wound afflicting its chest. A long line of crude, scabbed-up stitches ran across the middle of its sternum and over its heart. Two stitches nearer the sternum had burst, leaving a red-lipped slit that exposed gleaming bone\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but that wasn\u8217\'92t the worst of the abuse meted upon this creature, for its hands had been cut off at the wrists. In their place were blood-stained poultices wrapped tight with white bandages. The hands themselves, spindly and long-fingered, were sitting in a far corner of the cave, one stacked on top of the other like a pair of gloves ready to be slipped into.}
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Why a demon had met such abuse, Mandri was not sure. Perhaps this was a human half-transformed still suffering through its long punishment. A cell-mate. A vision of what was in store. Soon, or slowly, all recognizable details that made Mandrameen Mandrameen would be bent and broken, the defining features of his face would be rearranged into that same bald-headed and blank stare.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And no doubt he would be tortured, hence the creature\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wounds. And after the torture would come periods of healing, hence the stitching on the chest and the bandaged arms. This all made sense because Shis couldn\u8217\'92t be all-torture all-the-time, as then the pain would lose its meaning. There would need to be moments like this of healing to allow time for reflection. And no doubt the torture would fit the crimes he\u8217\'92d committed up on the surface. Like this creature here had clearly been a thief. Cutting off the hands was a common enough punishment up on the surface, perhaps down here all thieves were doomed to have their hands lopped off and then regrown and then lopped off again. The chest wound was harder to parse. The stitches ran over the heart so perhaps this person had committed a crime of passion. That might also explain the erasure of its genitalia. }
\par\pard\plain \tx0\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was such a pitiful sight. If it had been up and alert the oddness of the creature might have been frightful, but the creature didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t seem capable of moving. It never even looked Mandri. Eventually it fell asleep, and when it did, Mandri felt enough at ease to lay back down and try to predict what fitting torture was in store for himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He thought long and hard about his crimes. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d never committed any unshoulderable sins, nothing to warrant being impaled on a spike a thousand times or tossed into a lake of fire. People shamed him for giving up on life, but as far as he knew, that wasn\u8217\'92t explicitly forbidden. Who was he harming? No one. Harming himself? Nonsense. He was only trying to find a bit of peace. He found peace by losing himself in burgeons, well, if that was wrong than the blame was on whoever had created burgeons. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t killed himself, so there was that. Mandri once told a teacher that he was going to kill himself. The teacher, a gray-bearded and wiry man, had been assigning problems intended to sniff out promising children that he could turn into scribes. The old man gave Mandrameen the dimensions of a cistern, 6 by 6 by 12 feet, and then he asked Mandri to find out how much land it could irrigate if it were half-full. Mandri said he\u8217\'92d rather kill himself than figure the answer. This wasn\u8217\'92t some flippant remark, he said it with complete sincerity. The old man called Mandri a petulant child and slapped him hard upside the head. He threatened to kill Mandri if he dared to make light of the Spark\u8217\'92s gift again. That made as much sense as threatening to throw someone off a cliff after they\u8217\'92ve threatened to jump.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This little reminiscence led Mandri to the conclusion that if Solraheen truly wanted to torture some purity back into his Spark, the best way to do it would be to put him right back up there on the surface and surround him with people like that teacher. Abusive old folk, violent assholes, the ignorant, the dumb, the vain people. People in general, really. Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t discriminate when it came to hating people. He himself was a person. He hated himself like the rest of them, and he was better than they were, so it was a dour situation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Was self-hatred a crime against the Spark?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If it was, there could be only one fitting punishment: he would be made to hurt himself. Somehow this place was going to get him to cut his own throat, or kick his own severed head into a hole. But how would they get him to do it? He wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t some penitent monk who took special delight in the cleansing awe of pain, so he\u8217\'92d need some prodding. He might be forced to ingest some will-controlling substance, or be strapped into some ancient contraption of iron, knives, chains, and pulleys that could bend his arms against his will and make him flay himself. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He tried to bend his arms but couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t. He did have arms wrapped under that brown blanket. He couldn\u8217\'92t feel them but there were forms where bulges where his arms should be. Then he saw his fingertips sticking out from under a blanket fold, and like what happens in a dream, as soon saw them feeling flooded into them, and suddenly, he had arms.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He wriggled around to loosen the blanket, and then pulled his left arm free. It was in remarkably good condition for a dead man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm. He tossed off the blanket and found that his whole body was more or less how he\u8217\'92d left it, still wearing that white tunic foisted upon him by Salavan. Nothing was black and rotting as he\u8217\'92d expected, though he was much dirtier, as if he\u8217\'92d just been pulled from the grave. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He sat up and his joints creaked. Caught a glint of firelight in the dark eyes of that ghoulish creature. The thing was looking at him, studying him with a cat-like curiosity. Then it pushed itself upright with it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s elbows, matching Mandri\u8217\'92s pose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri did not appreciate that look. Suddenly the creature didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t seem so helpless. He decided he should look for a way out of this cramped little space.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stood up, slow and deliberate, half because he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to make any sudden movements that could be misinterpreted, and half because his muscles simply couldn\u8217\'92t move any faster. He backed up against his side of the cave, neck bent against the low ceiling, and he felt his way along the sandstone towards the shadows on his right.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. So, Mandri shuffled back the other way, keeping close to the rock, staying as far away as he could from the pale creature that still watched with curious intent. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s searching fingers found a wide crack in the rock behind him. It seemed like an dark opening that he could shimmy through, but when he stuck his arm into ithis fingers butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his back exposed in present company, he returned to his brown blanket and straw bed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was only one other direction to explore\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 behind the creatures right shoulder was a hole in the rock wide enough to crawl into. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes strained to see if there if it dead-ended.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no way out that way,\u8221\'94 the demon said. Its voice was even and clear, shockingly free of the rankling pain it must be feeling. \u8220\'93Or I should say, there }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  an opening there that leads straight up, but it is not something you can fit through. I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92m afraid it\u8217\'92s just another cranny for the lizards.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lizards?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked. The word flew out of his mouth without him realizing conversation with this creature.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. Lizards,\u8221\'94 the demon said. It pointed up with the bloody stub that was its arm. And there up on the ceiling, half-buried in sooty cracks, were a dozen or so black blobs that Mandri had mistaken for shadows. He only understood what they were when one of them squeaked and then scurried along the ceiling towards the unexplored passageway, tiny talons scratching the rock as it went. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The demon laughed. It was an inviting laugh, and it had an unmistakable Hrkan lilt. Mandri wondered if this half-man-half-demon still remembered who it was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He asked it straight, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My name is Obo,\u8221\'94 said the creature.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you a demon?\u8221\'94, he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo smiled. Its smile radiant even in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs, but a disarming smile could be just as useful for a demon\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s purposes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you think I\u8217\'92m a demon?\u8221\'94 Obo asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You deny it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do. I am not a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look like a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your body is a perversion.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is it!?\u8221\'94 said Obo as they studied their own pale self in mock surprise. \u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t look so well yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was something suspect about this creature\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s curiosity. If this was indeed a man who\u8217\'92d been suffering alone for decades down here in Shis, starved of all companionship as he slowly mutated into a servant of Schisol, well Mandi supposed that such a person should be less calm, less inquisitive, more overbearing. And if that person had their hands recently and their chest opened up, then they should either be whimpering in pain or knocked out entirely. But Obo was sitting there, pale, dirty, and bloodstained, regarding Mandri , as if he were a cleric counting .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo leaned forward slightly and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve given you my name, so its only fair if you give me yours.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to tell you my name,\u8221\'94 Mandri said flatly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re under no obligation,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93but sharing one\u8217\'92s name is a kindly gesture. I think we could both use a friend, considering our circumstances.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And what would you do with my name?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would call you by it. What else would I do with it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had heard stories about what demons did with names. Some peoples keep their names hidden even from family. They walk around with clay cylinder\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s around their necks that functioned as names.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How about this,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t tell me your name, that\u8217\'92s fine. What utterance should I make to grab your attention?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t want you grabbing my attention.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo their bald first expression that }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you feel threatened by me?\u8221\'94 Obo asked. \u8220\'93What am I going to do, amble over there, and then do what? Bleed on you? I couldn\u8217\'92t kill a fly.\u8221\'94 Obo held up their two bloody stumps to belabor the point.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri remained firm. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to tell you my name,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then I will make up a name for you,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go ahead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I shall call you Chit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Chit?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look like a Chit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri found the assertion to be absurd. Names don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t determine what a person looks like.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mothers who love their sons a certain way tend to name them Chit. Chitavar. Chitavareen. They leave them too long on the tit. Untimely weaning makes the boy all pouty\u8230\'85 they all get that mousey look you have.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93These lizards, I believe they\u8217\'92re called knobheads, distinguished from other black-backed lizards by the extreme shortness of the neck.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No one does. But we do know is that there\u8217\'92s more kinds of lizard than there are kinds of anything else with teeth. So, its worth considering, why should it be that there are black ball lizards in Shis, and not, say, leaf-eared lizards or hook-tipped lizards.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re just lizards.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just answer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I died in the Meskalem.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Meskalem? That\u8217\'92s close enough to the Junei Pass.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why does that matter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because the Junei Pass is close enough to the Pitted Portion, and knobheads, as far as I know, lizards only live in the pitted portion. They sleep half the year and then they wiggle out of the ground when redberry blooms, and }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 only when }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 redberry blooms.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s your point?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You died in Meskalem, and your body is still fresh so you couldn\u8217\'92t have been dead long, meaning your corpse couldn\u8217\'92t have been carried far. Then you wake up in an underground cave infested with knobheads. It stands to reason, then, that you are not in Shis, you are in a cave which pocks the Pitted Portion.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A cave in the Pitted Portion could still be a part of Shis.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you wake up next to }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 me}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . We Mazydai have no divine Spark of our own and so we cannot, by our very nature, die and be carried to the afterlife.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You must admit, at the very least, that it is conceivable that you are not in the afterlife, that your dead body was found, brought down here, and then, through unknown means, brought back to life.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who would have done all this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I assume it was done by the same people who brought me down here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And who are they?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am not entirely sure. My Minder and I were tasked with destroying a band of outlaws who haunted the Junei Pass. Somehow, these outlaws overcame us. They slayed my Minder, captured me, and then brought me down here. They are an odd breed of thieves, zealots of a kind, but other than that I do not know much about them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 that}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  I don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t believe.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you\u8217\'92re one of the Mazydai, then prove it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 spit Mazydfire.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I cannot, as the ability to breath Mazydfire is contingent upon my Minder\u8217\'92s mood.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you said your Minder was killed.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then do something else that only a Mazyd can do, something more than listening to my eyes blink.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can avoid avoid all physical pain, but since that .\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What else.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only other thing that a Mazyd can do that a human can\u8217\'92t is admit when we\u8217\'92re wrong.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bullshit, I know the Mazydai have other powers. Like I know you can read minds.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s simply not true. We are merely observant and that catches some people by surprise.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s said that you know things no one else knows.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Our knowledge has limits like everyone else. I didn\u8217\'92t know that a human could come back the dead, yet here you are. I\u8217\'92ve read stories of it happening, but I always assumed they were only stories\u8230\'85 I have to ask, what was it like, being dead?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, seeing as I am dead, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 this}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  is what it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Again, you are not dead, and this is not Shis. It\u8217\'92s a cave. A relatively boring cave. Why you think a place like this is worthy of the title Shis\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it\u8217\'92s a failure of imagination.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen paintings of Shis, and some of them look a lot like this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Please, I\u8217\'92ve seen them too. It means nothing. Every single one a variation of the same thing: because people need to be punished for the things they did wrong.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t they?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But punishment is the only way it all makes sense. If people can go and do whatever they want to other people and not face consequences\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, that would be horrible.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would go further than that and say it would be evil.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What would a Sparkless Mazyd know about good and evil?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, I\u8217\'92m saying that if you }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 were}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  a Mazyd, you wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be trying to convince me that the gods are fundamentally evil.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But I\u8217\'92m not. I was merely presenting an alternative point of view as a kind of exercise. You see, I find it suspect that whenever a human talks about the will of the gods it always seems to line up with their own preconceptions. The truth is that while }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  think the afterlife needs to be a world of woe, Solraheen, Schisol, Ros, Broz, the dead gods and the living\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they might not feel the same way.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Humans created me, and yet I am nothing at all like you. There is some resemblance in physical form, but beyond that, I can assure you, the only thing we truly have in common is the capacity for language.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look enough like a human to me.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri hated it when people used metaphors to make a point. Just because a maps onto another doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t mean that there\u8217\'92s any truth in it. All it does is pull the argument out of the original thing, about the metaphor\u8217\'92s internal consistency instead of the  itself.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Something unseen and unheard interrupted Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s thought. Heard the sounds of of a muffled argument breaking out from the stone behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scooted towards crack to get a better listen. Whoever was outside was speaking the common tongue, but he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t make out the words. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He asked Obo, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are they arguing about?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo cocked his ear towards the crack. After a brief gathering of, he said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Evidently our two guards weren\u8217\'92t supposed to leave us alone. Their defense is that this little cave of ours reeks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sniffed the air and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s reasonable.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re coming.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What should we do?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am going to pretend to be asleep, and I\u8217\'92d appreciate it if you didn\u8217\'92t give me away.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With that, Obo laid back down against the wall and assumed the exact position he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been in when Mandri first saw him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As soon as Obo closed their eyes the stone through the crack began to slide. The grinding echoed out, torchlight flooded in, and not long after a short and stout Jandri man bumbled into the cave, hunched over, the flame of his torch licking the ceiling. Behind him  came another, skinnier man, this one of Hrkan character, but just as ragged all the same.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When the stout man saw Mandri sitting up, staring at him, he nearly dropped his torch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The boy\u8217\'92s awake!\u8221\'94 he shouted. \u8220\'93I told you that could happen!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The skinny man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes went wide. He said, \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t tell Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, I\u8217\'92m telling Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why? Nothin\u8217\'92s happened! Look! Look at \u8216\'91im! He\u8217\'92s barely moved.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man with the torch turned his attention Obo, who was back huddled in that pitiful, fitful sleep.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine,\u8221\'94 the stout man said. \u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t tell. But you\u8217\'92ve got to carry the Mazyd.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine by me. Barely weighs less than a poke of tinder anyway.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The skinny man stomped over to where Obo lay, making a fuss about the, than ferried the Mazyd out the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri asked the stout man, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Was that really a Mazyd?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man held the torch nearer to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face, nearly brushing it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t talk.\u8221\'94 he said.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The skinny man leaned into the light and said to Mandri, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you flap them lips again I\u8217\'92ll clip \u8216\'91em.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The stout man nodded in agreement.}

And the rule for you is, if anyone talks to you, you nod or shake your head\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s all you do, nod or shake. You understand?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The skinny spat a wad of unspeakable phlegm right on Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s knee. He chuckled to himself, then said to Mandri, \u8220\'93What were you doin\u8217\'92 out in that ravine, anywas?\u8221\'94}
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri did not know how to answer question by only moving his head. He wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have been able to answer it with words.}
