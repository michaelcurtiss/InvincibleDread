If he had known such a thing was possible then perhaps he would have guessed that the staticky prickling at the edge of his mind was the Spark reasserting its grip on his body. The Old Jandri word for this final stage of reanimation, this sublime sensation, is \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91Sheldruub', which is the same word ascribed to the wild slosh of ocean foam that gets beached during a world storm. Such storms can blanket an entire coast six feet deep with a salty pale-brown spume. When the storm eventually passes and the sun shines down, the air becomes saturated with the hiss of an uncountable number of bubbles popping through the course of days. The noise is not loud, it\u8217\'92s simply there and it is everywhere, a sound whose source can\u8217\'92t be placed and so it becomes something like the wind, a force of nature, hardly noticed except for when it disappears, and when it does there comes the memory of solid ground\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 though the ground is not the same as it once was for the storm has ravaged it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Mandrameen didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t notice the Sheldruub as his mind slid back into being. He didn\u8217\'92t notice the feeling of his own blood pumping through his veins and tickling his insides. He didn\u8217\'92t notice these things because he was afraid, and he was afraid because he thought he was dead and that this was the afterlife and that he was a cold corpse floating in a black void. The signs, he thought, were unmistakable. His very bones felt frigid, and his whole face was numb, if it was there at all. There was the unmistakable putrescence of rotting flesh. It was the exact same smell that he\u8217\'92d been forced to endure as a child, because rats liked to die under his floor. He\u8217\'92d have to endure the smell or sleep outside, but the first night Mandrameen slept outside, the spawn of gilt flies got to him. When he woke up the left half of his face was covered in hard, red welts the size of fingernails; the other half had been safely nestled in his pillow, so he looked like he\u8217\'92d been slapped in the face by disease. The only real}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1  }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 option was to endure the smell, and endure it he did. This is not to say that he got accustomed to it. The smell of rot was always upsetting, especially now, because, presumably, that smell was coming from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And he could the not move. Dead things do not move, therefore, he was dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yet, he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 could}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  breathe, and dead things do not breathe. His breath was icy coming out of his throat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He tried again to move but neither his legs nor arms would bend. In truth, he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure if he had legs or arms at all, for he couldn\u8217\'92t truly feel them. There was only a general chill where his legs and arms should be. And Just as he was coming to terms with the idea that his mind had been decoupled from his flesh and that all these sensations were but phantom memories and that his consciousness was floating somewhere inside his decomposing corpse, his eyes opened. They didn\u8217\'92t open far for they\u8217\'92d been glued shut by the crust of death, and Mandri closed them again as soon as he realized what was happening. He didn\u8217\'92t want to see the afterlife until he\u8217\'92d properly prepared for it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he finally opened his eyes again he was confronted with a low sandstone ceiling directly above him, a ceiling stained black with soot and flickering in a meager firelight. It was a natural stone, a familiar texture where the rocky surface was smooth and craggy and porous all at once\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a difficult thing to capture with a brush. Unmarred by the clawing rake of chisels, it was clear that this was no tomb, or mineshaft, or one of those rock-hewn hermit homes that pock the Zagros. A cave such as this, Mandri surmised, could only be Shis. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With great effort he twisted his head about and saw that the cramped walls of the cave bulged out in places and disappeared into pitch-blackness in others.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Surely this was Shis.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quite match the popular stories\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Shis was said to be a giant pit under the earth in which a mountain-sized tornado of fire that sweeps the up the dead and rakes their screaming bodies against white-hot spikes of iron embedded in the pit\u8217\'92s walls. Somehow this process cleanses the individual\u8217\'92s Spark of any pollutants.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There were other, less popular, visions of Shis. There was one frescoe in the city of Frum which matched what Mandri was currently experiencing. In this version of Shis, the dead are sequestered away deep underground in bubbles of rock. Those who repent of their sins are free to waste away, while those whose sins are too great to be forgiven suffer a different fate. Their caves become profane cocoons and inside they poor folk morph into some species of lizard, or, for more severe sins, they become outright demons.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri closed his eyes and conjured up an image of the rock under the earth riddled with pockets of air like this one, each one occupied by a waking corpse like him, each person forced to endure the mire of their own stench for some odd eternity. He found it oddly pleasant. He wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be bothered. No obligations. Since he was already dead, he didn\u8217\'92t have to worry about food.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he opened his eyes again he found he had full use of his neck. He looked down at his body and saw that he was wrapped tight in a brown woolen blanket, almost sarcophogus, and he was lying on a bed of straw. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was strange for place such as Shis to provide simple comforts. He looked to his left, to the source of light, and was confused to see that it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a tongue of fire piping up from the bowels of the earth. It was, instead, a small flame dancing on the end of a braided wick which bathed in a shallow red-clay dish filled with tallow. This dish sat in the middle of this little cave, and the meager flame had an outsized influence on the place. His re eyes stumbled over sight of living creature.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It lay laying slumped on it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s side against the opposite wall, the tallow lamp between them. It was a humanlike creature the likes of which Mandrameen had never seen. It had arms and legs and a familiar skeletal structure, but it was all out of proportion. It\u8217\'92s arms were stretched and gangly like a bat. It was small, and naked, and its skin was as pale and white as cloud. Grievous   blood and dark bruises, giving it the appearance of a starving, manged dog huddled up against the world. Its stringy tendons were almost as large as its muscles, and the deep furrows of shadow that marked its ribs shuddered with its every breath. Its stomach was grossly distended, smooth and round like a swelled up wineskin, and on top of this was it\u8217\'92s narrow, bony chest, shoulders drawn inward, hunched like a . And though its skin clung tight to its flesh there wasn\u8217\'92t the slightest hint of a vein or artery anywhere. It was all sinew, skin, stomach, and bones. Mandri supposed the creature was a \u8216\'91him\u8217\'92, but he wasn\u8217\'92t sure, for its groin was completely smooth and lacked any sign of gender. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a demon. Mandri was sure. A sensible conclusion because despite the creature\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s deformities, its face was smooth and fair. A handsome, cheekboned beauty, expression completely blank, with generic Hrkan features\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a thin mouth and sad eyes, all in symmetrical and genderless proportion. Its dark eyes were studying the grievous wound afflicting its chest. There a long line of stitches ran down the middle of the creature\u8217\'92s sternum. The sutures were caked in blood. Two stitches at the bottom had burst, leaving an open slit exposing cracked bone\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but that wasn\u8217\'92t even the worst of the abuse meeted upon this creature, for its hands had been cut off at the wrists. In their place were blood-stained poultices wrapped tight with white bandages. The hands themselves, spindly and long-fingered, were sitting in a far corner of the cave, one stacked on top of the other, like a pair of gloves ready for work.}
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Why a demon had met such abuse, Mandri was not sure. Perhaps this was a human half-transformed. Perhaps he was being met with a vision of what he would become. In the eon to come, all recognizable details that made him Mandrameen would be bent and broken, and the defining features of his face erased. His dimples and moles and black shaggy hair, it would all be pulled out and smoothed over until all that is left is this expressionless puppet in the general shape a human being. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be tortured, hence the wounds. And after the torture would come periods of healing, for Shis couldn\u8217\'92t be all-torture all-the-time because then the pain would lose its meaning. There would need to be moments like this of healing to set a contrast. If he were the architect of the Underworld, he would go further than this, he would put moments of outright pleasure in. Bring a man up to such highs so as to make the lows feel that much lower.}
\par\pard\plain \tx0\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d also make sure the torture fit the crime. Like this creature here had clearly been a thief. Cutting off the hands was a common enough punishment up on the surface, perhaps down here all thieves were doomed to have their hands lopped off and then regrown and then lopped off again. The chest wound was harder to parse. The stitches ran over the heart so perhaps this person had committed a crime of passion. That would also explain the erasure of its genitalia. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri continued to study the creature. At first he was afraid that the thing might spring up on him and attack, but the creature did not move. It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even look at him. Eventually it closed its eyes and slept. When it did, Mandri felt enough at ease to lay back and try to predict what fitting torture was in store for himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He thought long and hard about his crimes. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t had any unshoulderable sins. Nothing to warrant being impaled on a spike a thousand times or tossed into a lake of fire. The only questionable life decision he\u8217\'92d made was that he had given up on life. As far as he knew, that wasn\u8217\'92t explicitly forbidden. Who was he harming? No one. Harming himself? Nonsense. He was only trying to find a bit of peace. And if only the only way to find that peace was to hike out wilderness and drown out the with burgeons, well then that was a fault in creation, not himself. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t killed himself, so he didn\u8217\'92t have that weighing on his conscience. Mandri once told a teacher that he was going to kill himself. The teacher, a gray-bearded and wiry man, had been assigning problems intended to discover promising children that he could turn into Hrkan scribes. The old man gave Mandrameen the dimensions of a square cistern, 6 by 6 by 12 feet, and then he asked Mandri to find out how much land it could irrigate if it were half-full. Mandri said he\u8217\'92d rather kill himself than figure the answer, and he said it with complete sincerity. The old man called Mandri a petulant child and slapped him hard upside the head. He threatened to kill Mandri if he dared to make light of the Spark\u8217\'92s gift again, and that made as much sense as threatening to throw someone off a cliff after they\u8217\'92ve threatened to jump.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If Solraheen truly wanted to torture some purity into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Spark, the best way to do it would be to put him right back up there on the surface and surround him with people like that teacher. Abusive old folk, violent assholes, the ignorant, the dumb, the vain people. People in general, really. Mandri didn\u8217\'92t discriminate when it came to hating people. He himself was a person.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Was hating himself a sin?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If it was, there could be only one punishment which would fit the theme: he would be made to hurt himself.  Somehow this place was going to get him to cut his own throat, or kick his own severed head into a piss hole. There wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t use in trying to predict the particulars of the pain because there was an infinite number of ways to mutilate the self. The only thing Mandri was concerned with was how they\u8217\'92d get him to do it. He wasn\u8217\'92t some penitent monk who took special delight in the cleansing awe of pain, so he\u8217\'92d need some prodding. He might be forced to ingest some mind-controlling substance, or be strapped into a hellish contraption of iron, knives, chains, and pulleys that could bend his arms against his will and make him flay himself. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With this vision fixed in his mind he realized that he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure he had arms to bend. His whole body was wrapped up in that brown blanket. He looked down and saw that were forms under the blanket where his arms should be. Then he saw his fingertips sticking out from under the sides, and like what happens in a dream, as soon saw them feeling flooded into them, and suddenly, he had arms.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He wriggled the blanket loose and pulled his left arm from out of it. It was in remarkably good condition for a dead man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm. He tossed off the blanket and found that his whole body was more or less how he\u8217\'92d left it. It was a little bruised but it was all there and functioning, not black and rotting as he\u8217\'92d expected. He could wiggle his toes. And he was still dressed in his blue tunic, which was heavily dusted clay, as if he\u8217\'92d just been pulled from the grave.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He looked over at the ghoulish creature and the thing\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes were open now, looking at him. It seemed surprised. Mandrameen wondered if he was supposed to do something, speak to the creature, but decided instead to look for a way out of this cramped little space\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 if he needed to flee, he needed to.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stood up, slow and deliberate, hands held out, careful not to make any sudden movements. He backed up against the wall, bent down against the low ceiling, and felt his way along the sandstone towards the shadows on his right.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 After a few steps he could see that the rock in that direction dipped into a little hollow with no way out. So, Mandri went back to his left, keeping close to the rock, staying as far away as he could from the pale creature that looked too curious for Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s liking. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To his left, hidden from the flickering lamplight, was a wide crack and what seemed like an dark opening that he could shimmy through. He stuck his arm into it, but his fingers butted up against stone. Satisfied that there was no way through, and eager to not have his back exposed in present company, he returned to his brown blanket and straw bed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was only one other direction to explore\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there was a patch of darkness near the creature, a spot where the sandstone bent backwards into the ineffable darkness. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes strained to see if there if it deadened, or if the darkness really did go all the way back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The half-man half-demon sat up and waved the stump of its arm in greeting. Then it spoke. Its voice was even and clear, shockingly free of the rankling pain it must be feeling. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no way out that way,\u8221\'94 it said. \u8220\'93Or I should say, there }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  an opening there that leads straight up, but it is not something you can fit through. I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92m afraid it\u8217\'92s just another cranny for the lizards.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lizards?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked. The word flew out of his mouth without him realizing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. Lizards,\u8221\'94 the creature said. It pointed up with the stub of its arm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There, clinging to cracks in the sooty ceiling, were a dozen or so black blobs that Mandri mistook for shadows. He only understood what the were when one of them squeaked and then unwrapped itself and scurried along the rock towards the unexplored passageway, tiny talons scratching as it went. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The demon laughed. It was an inviting laugh, suggesting an openness to conversation, and what\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s more is that laugh had an unmistakable Hrkan lilt. Mandri wondered if this half-man half-demon still remembered who it was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He asked it straight, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My name is Obo.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The creature saw him look away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t worry, I\u8217\'92m not going to hurt you. Not that I\u8217\'92d be able to.\u8221\'94 Obo held up his handless arms to belabor the point.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders, and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you a demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo smiled. His teeth were clean, white, and even, radiant even in this dim lamplight. Mandri had been expecting fangs, but this meant nothing. A disarming smile could be a useful tool for a demon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you think I\u8217\'92m a demon?\u8221\'94 Obo asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What, you\u8217\'92re not a demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But your body is a perversion.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is it!? Nice to meet you, too. What is your name, I wonder?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to tell you my name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re under no obligation,\u8221\'94 Obo said, \u8220\'93but sharing one\u8217\'92s name is a kindly gesture. I think we could both use a friend, considering our shared circumstances.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri paused.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And what would you do with my name?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would call you by it. What else does one do with a name?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whatever it is demons do with names.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri shrugged. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard stories. Some peoples keep their names hidden even from family. They walk around with clay cylinder\u8217\'92s around their necks that functioned as names.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How about this,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93What utterance should I make to grab your attention?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t want you grabbing my attention.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo leans forward. The hand was his own fault.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you feel threatened by me? Look at me. What am I going to do? Amble over there, and then do what? Bleed on you? The horror. Please, friend, I look strange, I know, but get over it. I am not a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to tell you my name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then I will make up a name for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go ahead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I shall call you Chit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Chit?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look like a Chit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri found the remark absurd. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What does a \u8216\'91Chit\u8217\'92 look like?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mothers who love their sons a certain way tend to name them Chit. Chitavar. Chitavareen. Pampered boys. They become dour boys. You\u8217\'92ve got that mousey look. I bet you think highly of yourself, don\u8217\'92t you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why in shis do people keep saying that.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s that unfounded certainty. So typical of a Chit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not a \u8216\'91Chit\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Again with the certainty. You think that there is only two of us down here.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looks around. If he missed the lizards, maybe he missed something or someone else. He eyed the cleft of darkness that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been too afraid to check.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo smirked, and said. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, no one is not back there.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s someone out there.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is it a demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo, bemused. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not unless a demon\u8217\'92s snore sounds exactly like an underweight Jandri man who\u8217\'92s chewed too many borcandi spines.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can tell all that from just a snore?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Borcandi juice gets phlegmy in the throat. It gives it that - you hear it? Gives the snore that wet, kind of sputtering tune.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo leaned back against the rock. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me, Chit, why do you think everyone down here is a demon? These Lizards, are they demons too?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure. Everyone knows lizards are Schisol\u8217\'92s children. Creatures of the dark. It\u8217\'92s only natural for them to be roosting in the Shis.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You think that this place is literally Shis?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was here before you?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So I believed. Yet, here you are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri instinctively doubts that Obo could hear his heart, though he could hear the man snoring outside.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So what are you then, if not a demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Depends on who you ask. In truth, you are far from the first to call me a demon. Even the lowliest servants of the Hrkan Lords get called demons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You serve the Lords?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That it what I said, yes.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s just a cave.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Contrary to popular belief lizards are not demons that have too far. They are simple bats, bush-tailed bats. You can tell from the way their wings attach to the spine instead of the sides, and, well, by the bushy tails.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you know how many species of lizard there are in Jandri? Hundreds. Maybe a thousand. There\u8217\'92s more kinds of lizard than there are kinds of dog, or cat. Or any other furry creature for that matter.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re just lizards.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I died in the Meskalem.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Meskalem? That\u8217\'92s close enough to the Junei Pass.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Black blobl lizards only live in the Hias, near the Junei Pass. They sleep all winter and then they come out at spring to feast on the nectar of redberry blooms, and }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 only }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 redberry blooms. Unlike most lizards, they aren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t opportunistic feeders. There\u8217\'92s only one place on the whole continent where redberry bushes grow, and that\u8217\'92s the slopes of the Eastern Hias.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You died in Meskalem, and your body is still fresh so you couldn\u8217\'92t have been dead long, meaning your corpse couldn\u8217\'92t have been carried far. Then you wake up in an underground cave near some black-blobs, and blobs sleep in the caves of the Pitted Portion, right next to the Junei Pass.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you wake up next to }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 me}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . I have no divine Spark and so I cannot, by my very nature, die and go to the afterlife. Taken all together, is it not conceivable that you are not in the afterlife, that your dead body was found, brought down here, and then, through unknown means, brought back to life?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And who would have done all this?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And who are they?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am not entirely sure. My Minder and I were tasked with destroying a band of outlaws who haunted the Junei Pass. Somehow overcame us. They slayed my Minder, captured me, and then brought me down here. These people are some odd breed of thieves, zealots of a kind, other than that I do not know much. I killed a number of them, and then I went black. Later I woke up here with all these wounds.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A Mazydai ambushed by thieves? Impossible.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Think of how I feel. You call the very sight of me is a \u8216\'91perversion\u8217\'92. And you repeatedly name me a demon.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Aren\u8217\'92t you supposed to know things that normal people don\u8217\'92t know?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We are learned creatures, but I wouldn\u8217\'92t go further than that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What happens when a dies?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93On that matter, there are conflicting reports, and to no one\u8217\'92s surprise, these reports are unreliable. I should ask you that question, seeing as you\u8217\'92ve been there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t remember anything of death. I died and woke up here. If I went anywhere while dead, then I don\u8217\'92t remember it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then perhaps that is how it is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think so.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not? Why does death have to be different than an undreaming sleep?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because people need to be punished for the things they did wrong.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do they?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not so sure. The gods don\u8217\'92t seem too concerned about justice in this world, so I don\u8217\'92t see why they\u8217\'92d be concerned about it in the world hereafter.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Punishment is the only way it }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 does}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  make sense. If people can go and do whatever they want to other people and not face consequences\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That would be horrible.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Horrible. Terrible. You might say, unjust.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only way that I could believe that this is isn\u8217\'92t Shis, that this is all real, is if this is my punishment. I went against the word of the Septuagint and committed the crime of self-harm. I tried to escape this world, and so, it would be fitting to send me right back. Poetic, in a way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93First you think the gods care about justice, now you think they care about poetry?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sneered at Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bigotry. \u8220\'93What do }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  know about the gods?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t even have a Spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You believe, then, that I am a Mazyd Obo and not a demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know what I mean.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo chuckled. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, you are right, I don\u8217\'92t know much about the gods. The one thing I do know, however, is to never assume that anyone thinks and feels the same way that I do about anything - and that holds true for gods especially.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s only true because you were not made in their image. Why should you think and feel as they do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is true, humans created me - and yet, I am nothing at all like you. There is some resemblance in physical form, but beyond that, I can assure you, the only thing we share is the capacity for language.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You seem human-like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A moth seems leaf-like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What does that even mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It means that - ah, hold on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Something unseen and unheard interrupted Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s thought. Mandri wondered what it could be. Obo closed his eyes. After a moment, he said in a hushed whisper, \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s movement outside.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 From the way Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head was cocked, Mandri supposed the movement was coming from where the snoring was earlier. Mandri held his breath and tried to listen in himself. He caught what he thought was the muffled of an argument. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He made to crawl towards crack to get a better listen. Obo stopped him with a brusque, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tsk!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri froze.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s voices.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do they say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92 \u8220\'93Evidently our guard was supposed to be in here.\u8221\'94 He smiled. \u8220\'93They suppose that we are both asleep.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo saw the worry written in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face. He said, \u8220\'93Should we humor them? Pretend to be asleep?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll keep my eyes open, thank you very much.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Suit yourself,\u8221\'94 Obo said. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With that, Obo slumped up against the wall. Assumed the precise position he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been in when Mandri saw him. So precisely the same, that Mandri began to wonder if the entire conversation he\u8217\'92d just had was only a dream. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And by the way, if it turns out that you\u8217\'92re wrong, and it\u8217\'92s not two demons stepping through that stone, then please, for me, soak your face in a bowl of beaten eggs.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then the sound of stone grinding against stone. Mandri looked to his left, hairs on his neck standing on end.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A short and stout Jandri man tumbled into the cave, and behind him came another who looked just like him, only a with a beard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first man saw Mandri sitting up, staring at him, he nearly dropped his torch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The boy\u8217\'92s awake!\u8221\'94 he shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Christ, Sob, I told you,\u8221\'94 said the second.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why? Nothing\u8217\'92s happened! Look! Look at him! Barely moved.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man with the torch glanced at Obo, who was feigning his fuge state.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t tell, but you\u8217\'92ve got to carry the Mazyd.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine by me. He hardly weighs more than a poke of tinder anyways.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You pick up that Mazyd - make sure they mention that Obo is indeed a Mazyd. Moment where mandri is like, is that really a mazydai?}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Swing around, torch almost brushing Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cheek.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The other man chimed in. Obo was slumped across his shoulders. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re among the Ayramun now,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve got to earn the right to talk.\u8221\'94}
