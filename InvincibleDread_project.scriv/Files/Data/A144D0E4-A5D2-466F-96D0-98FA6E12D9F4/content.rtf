He never announced it was time leave, or that everyone should think about heading out, he simply gathered up his enormous backpack and started off. Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even notice him go because the night sky was darkening into an unusual reddish tint, a shade he\u8217\'92d only seen in rotting berries, with this startling sheen, and the whole sky was flush with it. Then, suddenly, some hundred yards away there was a pack animal laden with the cruelest of burdens, lumbering east\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that was Ayram. Beyond Ayram was a much smaller black dot named Seb, who\u8217\'92d set out even earlier after complaining about how slow everyone was and that he was going to what he wanted to do. Nobody tried to stop him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Eventually Elrahet was good and ready to leave, and when she wandered out into the Sand she yelled back at Moto to bring the cursed Mazyd with him. Moto turned to his sister Moteah and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You heard the woman, bring the Mazyd with you,\u8221\'94 and then he jogged off after the others. The clank of iron and wood inside his own heavy pack almost seemed like teasing laughter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All the while Mandri was waiting for someone to tell him what to do. When Purl left he started to worry about being left behind. He wondered if a little initiative was expected, so he got up and started , but he was stopped when Moteah asked him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are you going?\u8221\'94. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He sat back down and , as he often did whenever burgeons weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t at hand, began to pity himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He could not recall a single day, from sunrise to sunset, where he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t suffered some shade of misery. He\u8217\'92d either be tired, or hungry, or suffering one of his more difficult to relate afflictions, like the strange sensation of feeling out of breath when he could breathe perfectly fine, or that odd tension in the middle of his chest that would flare up at night and he\u8217\'92d feel as if he\u8217\'92d just run a hundred miles that day despite the fact he\u8217\'92d done nothing but lounge in the shade and stare at the shadows of clouds as they crept across the world. He\u8217\'92d never had a good, solid day all the way through, at least, not for as far as he could remember.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d always believed that the reason for all this was that his life violated the aesthetic principle of contrast. White is only bright when it\u8217\'92s set against dark, and when one is living a life of relative luxury, as Mandri did, sheltered from the truly Bad, well, of course he\u8217\'92s not going to be able to see the Good when it is there. Prior to being bit by a demon, the worst physical pain he\u8217\'92d ever felt was mere discomfort\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 as a child, when his grandmother pawned his talents from city to city, they traveled in boats without cushioned seats.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Another part of the problem, he believed, was that when his mother was alive she did not play impressed at the things he made. She\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d look at a mud sculpture wrought by his tiny sausage fingers and would point out that it looked like the cast of an intestinal tract. She\u8217\'92d never smile and say, \u8220\'93What a lovely gift, thank you so much for making that for me,\u8221\'94 she would call it for what it was and go on about their day. It stood to reason, Mandri reasoned, that he couldn\u8217\'92t be happy as a man because his mother didn\u8217\'92t play dumb enough as he aged from three to six. Those are critical years. Where else but a mother is a child supposed to go for acceptance? Mandri would draw a picture and his mother would say some variation of, \u8216\'91this could be better\u8217\'92, and so of course he\u8217\'92d hate it too. At that age, what is a drawing but an ambitious fling at self expression? His drawings weren\u8217\'92t good enough, and so he wasn\u8217\'92t good enough, at least not until he\u8217\'92d reached the age of eight. That\u8217\'92s when his mother ran off with a rich man\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this according to his grandmother. He only later learned she\u8217\'92d killed herself with drink. The only thing she left him was the knowledge that nothing is good enough, and that people are all of them ugly, full of flaws, and that none of these flaws are beauty marks, smudges which when juxtaposed against perfection enhance it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chosen profession only enhanced his misanthropic mood, because if one sits and stares at another human being for long enough, as a portrait artist must do, the features of the face start to lose the illusion that they\u8217\'92re working together for a purpose. It doesn\u8217\'92t matter how attractive the person is, how much woodnut ash they\u8217\'92ve drawn onto their eyebrows to fix them, how much bug blood they\u8217\'92ve brushed onto their lips to sell the appearance of health, they can try to polish away the imperfections in the skin with the crushed up bones of children, when it came down to it, what a face was, was an odd mix of fleshy protuberances that masquerade as a rational being.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t about physical beauty. Mandri mainly hated people for }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 how}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  they were. The attention to physical detail was only a kind of metaphor\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 inner beauty, outer beauty, that sort of thing. Except for ears. Mandri truly hated ears. They look ridiculous. What kind of shape is an ear? It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s as if, when Solraheen was creating people, he took a wad of clay, crumpled it up and then slapped onto the side of the head expecting to come back to it later make it work but just never did. And the teeth, the gums especially, these are truly frightening things. Mandri had to paint a young beauty once and she insisted on smiling wide. The longer he looked, the more powerful was the feeling that a ravenous beast was soon to emerge from her throat, and at any moment it would leap out and start yapping for his flesh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The breath\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not quite part of one\u8217\'92s physical appearance, but oh, the breath! If there was ever a sign of what a person }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , it is stench of breath. Cover it up with a swig of pango juice, you can, but that doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t last long. Little wonder that in Jeket there\u8217\'92s a whole market square dedicated to tinctures and chews that are supposed to suppress the smell of the curdled things hiding in between the teeth, or pasting the tongue, or tucked into tonsil folds. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But ignore all that.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Get down to the basics.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Study the structure of the face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There is not one person alive who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face is symmetrical. There is always, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 always}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , some feature which started growing in the wrong direction as a child and just kept going. Or maybe it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t grow fast enough to keep up with the rest of it. Titled noses. Slanted jaws. Most common is the uneven eyes, or uneven brows. Sometimes the whole face circumnavigates around to one side, and so you see more of one cheek than the other. Or perhaps it was smushed that way as it was squeezed out of the womb and it stuck like that, leaving the mentioned with a lopsided smile.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Truthfully, the only parts of the body Mandri liked to look at were the ones he generally wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t allowed to look at\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a cosmic cruelty, but one he didn\u8217\'92t fret about because he suspected that the only reason he liked to look at them was precisely because he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed to. He once was fascinated by the sparkling charm contained within the eye, but he spent so much time with them they\u8217\'92d lost their sparkle. And as it goes with eyes, so it goes with everything.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Still, a beautiful woman has a numbing effect. Mandri had to work a little harder to discover their ugliness. Moteah was as beautiful as he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen in a while, but he was certain that if he got close enough, if he got a whiff of her breath, so to speak, then the illusion that she was something more than a walking, talking leather sack of flesh would crumble.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Still, she had no obvious tells.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sat there in the sand, hands idle, studying Moteah as she put together her pack of unimportant things. She fit the standard rule of thumb for beauty that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s taught to artists at an early age\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 don\u8217\'92t make too many marks. People start to look ugly if you have to make too many marks to bring out the features. If Mandri were to paint Moteah with as few marks as possible, he wouldn\u8217\'92t be lying all that much. Since it was dark, and Moteah\u8217\'92s skin was darker, he\u8217\'92d only need a few bright swoops to capture the sheen of the stars on her cheek and brow, on the fullness of her lips. Her nose was hardly there. Her ears? Tucked tight underneath her head wrap, thank god. And she never smiled, thank god for that too, not just because he was spared the sight of her flapping gums but because her stern features were tailor made for frowning.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In fact, she was frowning right now. She stood, hands on hips, in the timeless pose of the woman waiting for an idiot, and she was frowning.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She was frowning at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It took Mandri a moment to realize it, dark as the night sky was, but yes, she was frowning at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh, do you want me to carry something?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re carrying the Mazyd.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright,\u8221\'94 and then he stood up, and walked over to where Obo was resting. The Mazyd had a gag tied over his mouth. Mandri picked him up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah sighed and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Use the frame.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was wooden, L-shaped frame fitted with straps sitting next to Obo. It was the same device morning walkers used to carry sacks of grain. He tied Obo in and set it on his shoulders. The frame was the perfect size for his scrawny back, and it had a waist strap that pulled fast around his hips, and that kept Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s weight resting kindly on top of them. Altogether it was a bargain, for Obo couldn\u8217\'92t have weighed more than forty pounds. Moteah\u8217\'92s pack, in comparison, looked like it weighed a hundred.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thought he\u8217\'92d be heavier,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you can carry more...\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, no. No. It\u8217\'92s more than heavy enough for me. Let\u8217\'92s head out, shall we?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The hastening dark made it hard to read the Moteah flicked her brows in, then she wandered off to follow Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s footprints leading out east.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you fall behind and make me double back, I\u8217\'92ll kill you myself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh I won\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93I think I\u8217\'92ll make it. My leg feels much better thanks to Purl. Hopefully we don\u8217\'92t have a long ways to go.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Ullr Basin lies a hundred miles east of here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what, ten days?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It depends on Ayram\u8217\'92s speed. Ten days would be slow. Have you ever walked for ten days straight?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, but it doesn\u8217\'92t seem so bad.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked to see if they were following one of those old Charnel Roads that Moto had talked about, but if it was there he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see it. No gentle hump in the earth stretching off into the horizon. It was flat, and flat, and flat, and in the hazy distance, .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should be wearing Kell oil,\u8221\'94 Moteah said. She pointed up at the sun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t have any.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s some tied to my pack.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah stopped walking to let Mandri fish the skin of kell oil from her pack.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, \u8220\'93you don\u8217\'92t strike me as a\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 how should I put this\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 you don\u8217\'92t strike me as someone who belongs out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And why is that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93For starters, you have all your teeth. And then there\u8217\'92s the way you talk, the way you act, the way you look\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 you don\u8217\'92t seem like a person who would thrive out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep it with you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wrapped the oilskin\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s strap over his shoulder and neck.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should also eat something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve got some of that hardtack.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Here,\u8221\'94 Moteah fished into her and pulled out a wafer of hard spekky bread; a .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri took it from her chased after her. Could feel Mazydobo bobbing behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you mind if we talk?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not at all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you want to talk, then talk, don\u8217\'92t chatter.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well I wanted to ask\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what\u8217\'92s your story, you and Moto? Neither of you seem like you belong out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course I don\u8217\'92t, look at me. But even then I\u8217\'92d say I\u8217\'92m more suited to it. I\u8217\'92m an outcast. I was tossed out into the desert like trash. That\u8217\'92s what belongs out here, people that no one else has a use for.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nobody belongs in the desert,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about the outland tribes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They stick to oases and the wells they carve out of the ground, not the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An oasis is not the desert?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, it is not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about the Jeketian Fathers?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about them?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They lived in the desert. And there\u8217\'92s people that still live like them, they go and seek out caves, and, I don\u8217\'92t know, try to cleanse the Spark or something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That not what the Jeketian Fathers did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See, the fact that you even know that proves that you\u8217\'92ve had some education, and educated people don\u8217\'92t belong out in the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to repeat this again Mandri\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no one belongs in the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then what are the tribes doing out here?\u8221\'94}

The outland tribes have a good reason for being out here. All outcasts do. But you\u8217\'92re a desert flower. I bet you\u8217\'92d catch the eye of a Hrkan prince.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The look Moteah gave him chilled him to the bone, might have killed him if it hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t been blunted by the dark. The suggestion that she\u8217\'92d have anything to do with Hrk}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ganniba used to sit next to a river. Then the Hrks built some canals, diverted the river upstream. Our fields dried up, and that was the end of Ganniba. Now it\u8217\'92s part of the Sand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry to hear that. So you were pushed out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was. After Ganniba, my tribe set up a new home on a river bend in the Subli plain. Nobody lived there because it wasn\u8217\'92t sustainable, the earth was no good. The Hrks showed up anyway and said we weren\u8217\'92t allowed to be there.

We wanted to fight but we didn\u8217\'92t have any weapons. They gave us weapons. They waited four days for a courier to run to the nearest outpost and fetch a wagon load of spears. We fought with them. Our men had barely eaten in a week, but we fought. Our mothers fought. That was the end of my father\u8217\'92s tribe.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is there that you could possibly say? I just told you that the Hrks slaughtered my people, and you don\u8217\'92t think they\u8217\'92re evil?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everyone looks out for themselves, more or less. Everyone is taking advantage of someone else, whether they know it or not. The only difference is that the Hrks have a lot more power, so it\u8217\'92s all scaled up.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You mean they were conquered.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure. Whatever. They were conquered, and then they started farming near one of Meskahinne\u8217\'92s holes. They settled in, became full, upright citizens of Hrk, and guess what they did as soon as they got into politics? I kid you not, I watched a Sulay man argue, well, not argue, he was spitting rage, claiming that there was an untouched remnant of the Sulay tribe that needed taming. And this man knew what \u8216\'91taming\u8217\'92 meant. He knew what he was asking for. He wanted their shit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just because one old man has a charred spark, that doesn\u8217\'92t mean everyone is the same way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93On balance, on the whole, people look for the shortest path and more often than not, the shortest path involves running right through somebody else.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah slowed her pace. Mandri thought he had her thinking. When she surprised him by saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a good thing that you\u8217\'92re out here, Mandri.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You seem hateful, selfish, like a man who won\u8217\'92t swallow his spit to spite his own stomach. There\u8217\'92s no room for that way of being out in the Sand. People have to work together.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is there anyone you\u8217\'92d sacrifice yourself for?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah stopped walking. She pointed off to her left, at an unremarkable patch of scrubbrush.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She asked Mandri, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you see those hook flies?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Above the scrub there was little swarm of pinprick dots.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a couple hundred flies there,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93A fly can go anywhere\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they can walk along the ground, they can fly in every direction, they could explore to the ends of the earth and see sights unseen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but they don\u8217\'92t. They hover in that small, boring ball of air out here in the desert. You know why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94 Mandri braced himself for a bit of folksy outland wisdom.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hook flies swarm like that because even though the world is vast and beautiful, the most interesting thing in all of it is each other.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah gave Mandri a quick smile of questionable sincerity, and then she resumed her journey.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Mandri was stuck looking at those flies. Like most figures of speech, Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s had a surface charm that suggested a deeper truth, but it completely broke down upon further investigation. Those flies weren\u8217\'92t flying around in a ball because of the fulfillment they received from the excitement of being together. There were, no doubt, more primal interests at play. Maybe they\u8217\'92d found water there in that bush, or food, or the bush broke the breeze, making it easier to fly in the first place. Most likely it was about sex. They bunch up into a ball like that because it\u8217\'92s the easiest way to bump their little uglies into something that makes them feel alive.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Maybe one could say that still lines up with Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s idea of togetherness, but Mandri didn\u8217\'92t get the feeling that\u8217\'92s what she meant. These Ayramun were the least lascivious group of people he\u8217\'92d ever known\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he\u8217\'92d not seen a single sign of seduction between any of them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri jogged to catch up. The straps of his pack dug into his bony shoulders. Obo bobbed in his seat. When he finally joined up with Moteah, he asked her, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you trying to kill Solraheen? He\u8217\'92s the one bright light in this wretched world, so why kill him? Just to spite the Hrks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think you understand what the Hrk\u8217\'92s are doing to Solraheen. His body and His message have been so utterly polluted by Solitants that His name has nearly lost all it\u8217\'92s power. What He would want\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what He would command if His mind were not unwound by those poisonous fumes\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 is to have His own Spark cleansed of all impurity. The only way to do that is to destroy His body completely, and once that is done, Jeket will tumble down into the earth, and the rest of the Hrkan world will go with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Her pronouncement was as certain as it was insane. Here was the ugly flaw in Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s being\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she was a fanatic. And willing to destroy the world for it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What makes you so sure it\u8217\'92s going to play out like that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because our cause is righteous.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But why take the risk!? Like Obo said, killing Solraheen isn\u8217\'92t going to\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t care what the Mazyd said. The Mazydai are all fools incapable of true comprehension.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo seems clever to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m referring to divine comprehension. A Mazyd has no Spark. Also, you should stop calling him \u8216\'91Obo\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94 Moteah said the name with such contempt that Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t sure if the sting was meant for Obo or for him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But that\u8217\'92s his name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Names are for beings with Sparks. You wouldn\u8217\'92t name any of Tob\u8217\'92s rocks, would you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I might.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The more this conversation went on, the less Mandri was interested in continuing it. Moteah had met all his low expectations and then some. This was how ever conversation with a zealot went, devolving into a demands about what he should or shouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t do, usually at disrespecting someone\u8217\'92s boundaries. Mandri wanted to hate people in peace, but people like Moteah wanted to do something about it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stopped walking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have to go pee.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah frowned. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I have to come back and find you,\u8221\'94 she warned, \u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t say what will happen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it will be bad.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You won\u8217\'92t have to do anything. I promise, I\u8217\'92ll be right behind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah hiked her pack further up her shoulders. Her pack was so large that it had it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s own momentum, and as she turned and stepped forward, she had to move slow and build up speed until the pack\u8217\'92s forward motion seemed to sustain itself. Mandri was dismayed to see she was moving much faster than she had before. He\u8217\'92d be left far behind if he took too long pretending to take a leak.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The very moment Moteah was out of whisper range, Obo starting wiggling around and muffled pleas to have his gag removed. Mandri reached back, unslipped the knot keeping the gag fastned tight, and  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m touched, Mandri. I almost don\u8217\'92t know what to say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shut up about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought for sure you were going to sell me out again.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo, you were dead, and chances are, you\u8217\'92re going to die again very soon. I have to keep my options open.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So I can count on you to stab me in the back when danger comes?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Besides, I\u8217\'92m not with these people. They\u8217\'92re trying to kill Solraheen.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is an interesting development,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve heard of death cults wandering the Sand before, but I didn\u8217\'92t know that their philosophy extended out to killing Solraheen Himself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that what they are, a death cult?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re not consulting an expert, but from what I\u8217\'92ve read, the pieces fit. These Ayramun have an strange attachment to the dead. Consider those old bodies inside of Minting Rock, and also the way they gathered up the embattled dead, Hrk and their own alike, into one big pile. Most would keep them separate.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That pile of bodies was supposed to be a sphere,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Interesting. That would make sense. Supposedly these cults believe that in death a person\u8217\'92s Spark is joined with all others. They believe this physical world is a trap for the Spark, and so the seek to end it and free all Sparks so that everyone can be together in communion. No loneliness. No confusion. In killing they believe they are releasing the Spark into ecstasy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A death cult, huh.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri mulled it over, and it all made sudden sense. Suddenly he had to pee. As he relieved himself }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 a thought occurred, somewhere between, that there was fact that didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t fit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If they want everything to die, then why bring me back to life?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know. But them being a death cult explains why they would want to kill Solraheen. They might believe that in killing Him, they will free his Spark to join with all the others.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re insane.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. Sheer stupidity would also account for all the facts, though that is usually the case. However, there are strange forces at play in this desert, and I\u8217\'92ve made one too many incorrect assumptions already.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scanned the horizon\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0  it wide open space in every direction. No hills to hide behind, but the shadows behind every bush was dark as Fabled Black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you say to walking off in a different direction?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I doubt that would work. Our best bet is to continue on as the bait we are.\u8221\'94}
