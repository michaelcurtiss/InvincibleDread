He never announced it was time leave or that everyone should think about heading out, he simply gathered up his enormous backpack and started off. Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t notice him go because the sunset was darkening into an unusual reddish tint, a shade he\u8217\'92d only seen in rotting berries. The whole sky was flush with this startling purplish red. Then, suddenly, some hundred yards away was Ayram, lumbering east towards a featureless horizon. Beyond Ayram was a much smaller black dot named Seb. Seb had set out even earlier after complaining about how slow everyone was and that he was going to what he wanted to do. Nobody tried to stop him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Elrahet was good and ready to leave, she told Moto to bring the cursed Mazid with him, and she waddled, packless, out into the Sand. Moto turned to his sister Moteah and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You heard the woman, bring the Mazid with you,\u8221\'94 and then he jogged off after the others. The clank of iron and wood inside his own heavy pack almost seemed like teasing laughter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had been waiting for someone to tell him what to do. When Purl started out, he started to worry about being left behind. He wondered if a little initiative was expected, so he got up to follow, but he was stopped when Moteah asked him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are you going?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He sat back down and did as he often did whenever burgeons weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t at hand\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he began to pity himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He could not recall a single day, from sunrise to sunset, where he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t suffered some shade of misery. He\u8217\'92d either be tired, or hungry, or suffering one of his more difficult to relate afflictions, like the strange sensation of feeling out of breath when he could breathe perfectly fine, or that odd tension in the middle of his chest that would flare up at night and he\u8217\'92d feel as if he\u8217\'92d just run a hundred miles despite the fact that he\u8217\'92d done nothing but lounge in the shade and stare at the shadows of clouds as they crept across the world. He\u8217\'92d never had a good, solid day all the way through, at least, not for as far as he could remember.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d always believed that the reason for all this was that his life violated the aesthetic principle of contrast. White is brightest when it\u8217\'92s set against dark\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 see Solraheen. When one is living a life of relative luxury, as Mandri did, sheltered from the truly Bad, well, of course he\u8217\'92s not going to be able to see the Good when it is there. Prior to being bit by a demon, the worst physical pain he\u8217\'92d ever felt was mere discomfort\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 as a child, when his grandmother pawned his talents from city to city, they traveled in boats without cushioned seats, the horror.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He blamed his mother for it all. When his mother was alive she did not play impressed at the things he made. She\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d look at a mud sculpture wrought by his tiny sausage fingers and would point out that it looked like the cast of an intestinal tract. She\u8217\'92d never smile and say, \u8220\'93What a lovely gift, thank you so much for making that for me,\u8221\'94 she would call it for what it was and go on about her day. It stood to reason, Mandri reasoned, that he couldn\u8217\'92t be happy as a man because his mother didn\u8217\'92t play dumb enough as he aged from three to six. Those are critical years. Where else but a mother is a child supposed to go for acceptance? Mandri would draw a picture and his mother would say some variation of, \u8216\'91this could be better\u8217\'92, and so of course he\u8217\'92d hate it too. And at that age, what is a drawing but an ambitious fling at self expression? His drawings weren\u8217\'92t good enough, and so he wasn\u8217\'92t good enough\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 at least not until he\u8217\'92d reached the age of eight. By then his mother was lost to drink and had run off with a rich man\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this according to his grandmother. He only later learned she\u8217\'92d killed herself. The only thing she left him was the knowledge that nothing is good enough, and that people are all of them ugly and full of flaws. None of these flaws are beauty marks, smudges which when juxtaposed against perfection enhance it. Ugly is just plain old ugly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If one sits and stares at another human being for long enough, as a portrait artist must do, the features of the face start to lose the illusion that they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re working together for a purpose. It doesn\u8217\'92t matter how attractive the person is, how much woodnut ash they\u8217\'92ve drawn onto their eyebrows to fix them, how much bug blood they\u8217\'92ve brushed onto their lips to sell the appearance of health, they can try to polish away the imperfections in the skin with the crushed up bones of children. When it came down to it, what a face was, was an odd mix of fleshy protuberances that masquerade as a divinely Sparked being.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t about physical beauty. Mandri mainly hated people for }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 how}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  they were. The attention to physical detail was only a kind of metaphor\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 inner beauty, outer beauty, that sort of thing. Except for ears. Mandri truly hated ears. They look ridiculous. What kind of shape is an ear? It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s as if, when Solraheen was creating people, he took a wad of clay, crumpled it up and then slapped onto the side of the head expecting to come back to it later make it work but never did. And the teeth\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the gums especially\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 these are truly frightening things. Mandri once had to paint a young beauty who insisted on smiling wide. The longer he looked, the more powerful was the feeling that a ravenous beast was soon to emerge from her throat, and at any moment it would leap out and start yapping for his flesh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The breath\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not quite part of one\u8217\'92s physical appearance, but oh, the breath! If there was ever a sign of what a person }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , it is stench of breath. Cover it up with a swig of pango juice, but that doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t last long. Little wonder that in Jeket there\u8217\'92s a whole market square dedicated to tinctures and chews that are supposed to suppress the smell of the curdled things hiding in between the teeth, or pasting the tongue, or tucked into tonsil folds. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But ignore all that.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Get down to the basics.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Study the structure of the face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There is not one person alive whose face is symmetrical. There is always, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 always}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , some feature which started growing in the wrong direction as a child and kept going with age. Or maybe it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t grow fast enough to keep up with the rest of it. Titled noses. Slanted jaws. Most common is the uneven eyes, or uneven brows. Sometimes the whole face swivels around to one side, and so you see more of one cheek than the other. Or perhaps it was smushed that way as it was squeezed out of the womb and it stuck like that, leaving the mentioned with a lopsided smile.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Truthfully, the only parts of the body Mandri liked to look at were the ones he generally wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t allowed to look at\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a cosmic cruelty, but one he didn\u8217\'92t fret about because he suspected that the only reason he liked to look at them was precisely because he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed to. He once was fascinated by the sparkling charm contained within the eye, but he spent so much time with them that they\u8217\'92d lost their sparkle. And as it goes with eyes, so it goes with everything.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Still, a beautiful woman has a numbing effect. Mandri was a man, after all. With these creatures he had to work a little harder to discover their ugliness. Moteah was as beautiful as he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen in a while, but he was certain that if he got close enough, if he got a whiff of her breath, so to speak, then the illusion that she was something more than a walking, talking sack of flesh that defecates would crumble.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Still, she had no obvious tells.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sat on a rock, hands idle, studying Moteah as she put together her pack of unimportant things. She fit the standard rule of thumb for beauty that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s taught to artists at an early age\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 don\u8217\'92t make too many marks. People start to look ugly if one makes too many marks to bring out the features. If Mandri were to paint Moteah with as few marks as possible, he wouldn\u8217\'92t be lying all that much. It was getting dark, and Moteah\u8217\'92s skin was darker, so he\u8217\'92d only need a few bright swoops to capture the sheen of the stars on her cheek and brow, on the fullness of her lips. Her nose was hardly there. Her ears? Tucked tight underneath her head wrap, thank god. And she never smiled, thank god for that too, not just because he was spared the sight of her flapping gums but because her stern features were tailor made for frowning\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was beautiful.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In fact, she was frowning right now. She stood, hands on hips, that timeless pose of the woman waiting for an idiot, and she was frowning.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She was frowning at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It took Mandri a moment to startle out of his reverie to realize the implication.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh, do you want me to carry something?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re carrying the Mazid,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright,\u8221\'94 and then he stood up, and walked over to where Obo was resting. Obo had a gag tied over his mouth, and Mandri picked him up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah sighed and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Use the frame.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was wooden, L-shaped frame fitted with straps sitting next to Obo. It was the same device morning walkers used to carry sacks of grain. He tied Obo in, bent down, and set the whole thing shoulders. The frame was the perfect size for his scrawny back, and it had a waist strap that pulled fast around his hips, and that kept Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s weight resting kindly on top of them. He bounced up and down to test its weight, and was delighted to find that his chewed-up leg was making a miraculous recovery.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It helped that Obo couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have weighed more than thirty pounds.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack, in comparison, looked like it weighed a hundred.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thought he\u8217\'92d be heavier,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you can carry more...\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, no. No. It\u8217\'92s more than heavy enough for me. Let\u8217\'92s head out, shall we?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The hastening dark made it hard to read the look Moteah as she said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Please don\u8217\'92t fall behind and make me double back.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh I won\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93I think I\u8217\'92ll make it. My leg feels much better thanks to Purl. Hopefully we don\u8217\'92t have a long ways to go.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Bullr Basin lies a hundred miles east of here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One hundred miles?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s answer was to begin walking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri followed after her and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what, ten days?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It depends on Ayram. Ten days for him would be slow. Have you ever walked for ten days straight?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Mandri said meekly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He looked to see if they were following one of those old charnel roads. If it was there he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see it, as there was no gentle hump in the earth stretching off into the horizon. It was flat, and flat, and flat, and flat even in the hazy distance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you have any kell oil,\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s some tied to my pack.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She stopped walking to let Mandri fish the skin of kell oil from her pack.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, \u8220\'93you don\u8217\'92t strike me as a\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 how should I put this\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 you don\u8217\'92t strike me as someone who belongs out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And why is that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have all your teeth. And then there\u8217\'92s the way you talk, the way you act, the way you look\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 you don\u8217\'92t seem like a person who would thrive out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri began to unscrew the skin\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cap. Moteah stopped him and said, \u8220\'93You wait for the sun to put on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, right.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He then wrapped the oilskin\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s strap over his shoulder and neck and they continued on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you mind if we talk?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not at all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well I wanted to ask\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what\u8217\'92s your story, you and Moto? Neither of you seem like the ordinary outland poke. Well, none of you are, except for Seb. But you and Moto seem\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 don\u8217\'92t take offense, but you seem normal. You\u8217\'92re not the kind of people that belong in the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nobody belongs in the desert,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about the outland tribes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They stick to oases and the wells they carve out of the ground.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An oasis is not the desert?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, it is not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then what are the tribes doing out here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If they\u8217\'92re out here, they were pushed out here. Stop talking about the desert like you know anything about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s there to know? It\u8217\'92s hot, there\u8217\'92s sand, demons hiding in holes, and no water.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah stopped walking, and squatted down like she was about to drop her heavy pack, but instead she reached down and plucked a stone from the ground.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Squeeze it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She handed it over and Mandri squeezed it. He was surprised to find that it was not a rock, but some sort of bulbous root. Water squirted out of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay, there might be water stashed away, but this doesn\u8217\'92t change the fact that you don\u8217\'92t belong out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No one belongs out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are you from? Zos?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ganniba.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Out in the desert,\u8221\'94 Moteah said slyly. Then she added, \u8220\'93Ganniba used to sit next to a river. Then the Hrks built some canals, diverted the river upstream, and our fields dried up. That was the end of Ganniba. Now it\u8217\'92s part of the Sand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So you were pushed out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was. After Ganniba, my tribe set up a new home on a river bend in the Subli plain. Nobody lived there because the earth was no good. The Hrks showed up anyway and said we weren\u8217\'92t allowed to be there. They said the only place we were permitted to live was within the Subli delta. I\u8217\'92m sure you know what happens in the Subli delta.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We said no thank you. There was a scribe like the one you saw at Minting Rock. He said submit, or fight. We wanted to fight but we didn\u8217\'92t have any weapons. They gave us weapons. They waited four days for a courier to run to the nearest outpost and fetch a wagon load of spears. We fought with them. Our men had barely eaten in a week, but we fought. Our mothers fought. I fought. That was the end of my father\u8217\'92s tribe.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s, uh\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 you seem remarkably well composed, considering.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not an unusual story.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know, there\u8217\'92s this one outland tribe, called the Sulay, and they got absorbed into the Lord Meskihinne\u8217\'92s lands.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You mean they were conquered.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Absorbed, conquered, its the all the same.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Absorbed implies that half of them weren\u8217\'92t murdered first.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure, they were conquered, and then they started farming near one of Meskihinne\u8217\'92s holes. They settled in, became full, upright citizens of Hrk, and guess what they did as soon as they got into politics? I kid you not, I watched a Sulay man argue, well, not argue, he was spitting rage, and he was saying that there was an untouched remnant of the Sulay tribe that needed taming. And this man knew what \u8216\'91taming\u8217\'92 meant. He knew what he was asking for. He just wanted their land.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you saying?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m saying that Hrk is bad, but I\u8217\'92ve met enough people to know that we\u8217\'92re all more or less the same. If you had the reins of a nation as big as Hrk, you\u8217\'92d be bullying everyone else into doing what you want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is the exact opposite of what I would do. Just because one old Sulay man had a charred spark, that doesn\u8217\'92t mean everyone is the same way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah slowed her pace. Mandri thought he had her thinking. She surprised him by saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a good thing that you\u8217\'92re out here, Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why is that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Sand is going to sip the spit out of you, one day at a time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know what that means.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is there anyone you\u8217\'92d sacrifice yourself for?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I\u8217\'92ve never met someone who }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 needs}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to be alive, if that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what you\u8217\'92re asking.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah stopped walking altogether. She pointed off to her left, at an isolated but otherwise unremarkable patch of scrub bush.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She asked Mandri, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you see those hook flies?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Above the bush there was little swarm of pinprick dots.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a few hundred flies there,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93A fly can go anywhere\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they can walk along the ground, they can fly in every direction, they could explore to the ends of the earth and see sights unseen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but they don\u8217\'92t. They hover in that small, boring ball of air out here in the desert. You know why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri braced himself for a bit of folksy outland wisdom.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hook flies swarm like that because even though the world is vast and beautiful, the most interesting thing in all of it is each other.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah gave Mandri a quick smile of questionable sincerity, and then she resumed her journey.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Mandri was stuck looking at those flies. Like most figures of speech, Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s had a surface charm that suggested a deeper truth, but it completely broke down upon further investigation. Those flies weren\u8217\'92t flying around in a ball because of the fulfillment they received from the excitement of being together. There were, no doubt, more primal interests at play. Maybe they\u8217\'92d found water there in that bush, or food, or the bush broke the breeze, making it easier to fly in the first place. Most likely it was about sex. They bunch up into a ball like that because it\u8217\'92s the easiest way to bump their little uglies into something that makes them feel alive. Maybe one could say that still lines up with Moteah\u8217\'92s idea of togetherness, but Mandri didn\u8217\'92t get the feeling that\u8217\'92s what she meant. These Ayramun were the least lascivious group of people he\u8217\'92d ever known\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he\u8217\'92d not seen a single hint of seduction between any of them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri jogged to catch up. The straps of his pack dug into his bony shoulders. Obo bobbed in his seat. When he finally joined up with Moteah, he asked her, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you trying to kill Solraheen? He\u8217\'92s the one bright light in this wretched world, so why kill Him? Just to spite the Hrks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think you understand what the Hrk\u8217\'92s are doing to Him. His body and His message have been so utterly polluted by Solitants that His name has nearly lost all it\u8217\'92s power. What He would want\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what He would command if His mind were not unwound by those poisonous fumes\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 is to have His own Spark cleansed of all impurity. The only way to do that is to destroy His body completely, and once that is done, Jeket will tumble down into the earth, and the rest of the Hrkan world will go with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Her pronouncement was as certain as it was insane. And here was the ugly flaw in Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s nature\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she was a fanatic. She was willing to destroy the world for the mere hope of a better future.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri asked her, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What makes you so sure it\u8217\'92s going to play out like that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because our cause is righteous.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had to stifle a gasp.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But why take the risk!? Like Obo said, killing Solraheen isn\u8217\'92t going to\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t care what the Mazid said. The Mazidai are all fools and incapable of true comprehension.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo seems clever to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m referring to the Spark, Mandri. A Mazid has no Spark. Also, you should stop calling him \u8216\'91Obo\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94 Moteah said the name with such contempt that Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t sure if the sting was meant for Obo or for him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But that\u8217\'92s his name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Names are for beings with Sparks. You wouldn\u8217\'92t name any of Tob\u8217\'92s rocks, would you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I might.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The more this conversation went on, the less Mandri was interested in continuing it. Moteah had finally . This was how ever conversation with a zealot went. Soon she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be telling him what he should or shouldn\u8217\'92t do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stopped walking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have to pee.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I have to come back and find you,\u8221\'94 she warned, \u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t say what will happen\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it will be bad.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You won\u8217\'92t have to do anything. I promise, I\u8217\'92ll be right behind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah hiked her pack further up her shoulders. Her pack was so large that it had it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s own momentum, and as she turned and stepped forward, she had to move slow and build up speed until the pack\u8217\'92s forward motion seemed to sustain itself. Mandri was dismayed to see she was moving much faster than she had before. He\u8217\'92d be left far behind if he took too long pretending to take a leak. He\u8217\'92d wait just long enough to avoid any and all company.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Unfortunately, the very moment Moteah was out of whisper range, Obo starting wiggling around in his seat, and he issued a muffled plea to have his gag removed. Mandri reached back and unslipped the knot keeping the gag fastened tight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m touched, Mandri. I almost don\u8217\'92t know what to say. I thought for sure you were going to sell me out again.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t get excited. I reserve the right to betray you at any time.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo, you were dead, and chances are, you\u8217\'92re going to die again very soon. I have to keep my options open.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So I can count on you to stab me in the back when danger comes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Excuse me, who is carrying who right now?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A fair point.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Besides, I\u8217\'92m not with these people. They\u8217\'92re trying to kill Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri lifted up his robe. He figured he better make a show of relieving himself even if he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have to pee.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is an interesting development,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve heard of death cults wandering the Sand before, but I didn\u8217\'92t know that their philosophy extended out to killing Solraheen Himself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that what they are, a death cult?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re not consulting an expert, but from what I\u8217\'92ve read, the pieces fit. These Ayramun have a strange attachment to the dead. Consider those old bodies inside of Minting Rock, and also the way they gathered up those who fell in battle, Hrk and Ayramun alike, into one big pile. Most would keep them separate.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That pile of bodies was supposed to be a sphere,\u8221\'94 said Mandri as he recalled the work he\u8217\'92d put in to haul those rocks around. \u8220\'93What was that about?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Supposedly these cults believe that, in death, a person\u8217\'92s Spark is joined with all others. They believe this physical world is a trap for the Spark, and so they seek to end it and free all Sparks so that everyone can be together in communion.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A death cult, huh?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri mulled it over, and it all made sudden sense.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Suddenly he had to pee. As he relieved himself, a small brown lizard came crawling out of the sand to lick at the puddle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If they want everything to die, then why bring me back to life?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know. But them being a death cult explains why they would want to kill Solraheen. They might believe that in killing Him, they will free his Spark to join with all the others.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re insane.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sheer stupidity would also account for all the facts, though that is usually the case.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, that Elrahet woman is something strange. And Ayram too.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I admit,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93That there are strange forces at play in this desert, and I\u8217\'92ve made one too many incorrect assumptions already.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scanned the horizon\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it wide open space in every direction. No hills to hide behind, but the shadows behind every bush was dark as Fabled Black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you say to walking off in a different direction?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I doubt that would work. Our best bet is to continue on as the bait we are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wiggled his member and dropped his robe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let it be said that I that I think this is a bad idea.\u8221\'94}}
