He never announced it was time leave, or that everyone should think about heading out, he simply gathered up his enormous backpack and started off. Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even notice him go because the night sky was darkening into an unusual reddish tint, a shade he\u8217\'92d only seen in rotting berries, with this startling sheen, and the whole sky was flush with it. Then, suddenly, some hundred yards away there was a pack animal laden with the cruelest of burdens, lumbering east\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that was Ayram. Beyond Ayram was a much smaller black dot named Seb, who\u8217\'92d set out even earlier after complaining about how slow everyone was and that he was going to what he wanted to do. Nobody tried to stop him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Eventually Elrahet was good and ready to leave, and when she wandered out into the Sand she yelled back at Moto to bring the cursed Mazyd with him. Moto turned to his sister Moteah and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You heard the woman, bring the Mazyd with you,\u8221\'94 and then he jogged off after the others. The clank of iron and wood inside his own heavy pack almost seemed like teasing laughter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All the while Mandri was waiting for someone to tell him what to do. When Purl left he started to worry about being left behind. He wondered if a little initiative was expected, so he got up and started , but he was stopped when Moteah asked him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are you going?\u8221\'94. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He sat back down and , as he often did whenever burgeons weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t at hand, began to pity himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He could not recall a single day, from sunrise to sunset, where he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t suffered some shade of misery. He\u8217\'92d either be tired, or hungry, or suffering one of his more difficult to relate afflictions, like the strange sensation of feeling out of breath when he could breathe perfectly fine, or that odd tension in the middle of his chest that would flare up at night and he\u8217\'92d feel as if he\u8217\'92d just run a hundred miles that day despite the fact he\u8217\'92d done nothing but lounge in the shade and stare at the shadows of clouds as they crept across the world. He\u8217\'92d never had a good, solid day all the way through, at least, not for as far as he could remember.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d always believed that the reason for all this was that his life violated the aesthetic principle of contrast. White is only bright when it\u8217\'92s set against dark, and when one is living a life of relative luxury, as Mandri did, sheltered from the truly Bad, well, of course he\u8217\'92s not going to be able to see the Good when it is there. Prior to being bit by a demon, the worst physical pain he\u8217\'92d ever felt was mere discomfort\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 as a child, when his grandmother pawned his talents from city to city, they traveled in boats without cushioned seats.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Another part of the problem, he believed, was that when his mother was alive she did not play impressed at the things he made. She\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d look at a mud sculpture wrought by his tiny sausage fingers and would point out that it looked like the cast of an intestinal tract. She\u8217\'92d never smile and say, \u8220\'93What a lovely gift, thank you so much for making that for me,\u8221\'94 she would call it for what it was and go on about their day. It stood to reason, Mandri reasoned, that he couldn\u8217\'92t be happy as a man because his mother didn\u8217\'92t play dumb enough as he aged from three to six. Those are critical years. Where else but a mother is a child supposed to go for acceptance? Mandri would draw a picture and his mother would say some variation of, \u8216\'91this could be better\u8217\'92, and so of course he\u8217\'92d hate it too. At that age, what is a drawing but an ambitious fling at self expression? His drawings weren\u8217\'92t good enough, and so he wasn\u8217\'92t good enough, at least not until he\u8217\'92d reached the age of eight. That\u8217\'92s when his mother ran off with a rich man\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 this according to his grandmother. He only later learned she\u8217\'92d killed herself with drink. The only thing she left him was the knowledge that nothing is good enough, and that people are all of them ugly, full of flaws, and that none of these flaws are beauty marks, smudges which when juxtaposed against perfection enhance it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chosen profession only enhanced his misanthropic mood, because if one sits and stares at another human being for long enough, as a portrait artist must do, the features of the face start to lose the illusion that they\u8217\'92re working together for a purpose. It doesn\u8217\'92t matter how attractive the person is, how much woodnut ash they\u8217\'92ve drawn onto their eyebrows to fix them, how much bug blood they\u8217\'92ve brushed onto their lips to sell the appearance of health, they can try to polish away the imperfections in the skin with the crushed up bones of children, when it came down to it, what a face was, was an odd mix of fleshy protuberances that masquerade as a rational being.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t about physical beauty. Mandri mainly hated people for }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 how}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  they were. The attention to physical detail was only a kind of metaphor\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 inner beauty, outer beauty, that sort of thing. Except for ears. Mandri truly hated ears. They look ridiculous. What kind of shape is an ear? It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s as if, when Solraheen was creating people, he took a wad of clay, crumpled it up and then slapped onto the side of the head expecting to come back to it later make it work but just never did. And the teeth, the gums especially, these are truly frightening things. Mandri had to paint a young beauty once and she insisted on smiling wide. The longer he looked, the more powerful was the feeling that a ravenous beast was soon to emerge from her throat, and at any moment it would leap out and start yapping for his flesh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The breath\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not quite part of one\u8217\'92s physical appearance, but oh, the breath! If there was ever a sign of what a person }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , it is stench of breath. Cover it up with a swig of pango juice, you can, but that doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t last long. Little wonder that in Jeket there\u8217\'92s a whole market square dedicated to tinctures and chews that are supposed to suppress the smell of the curdled things hiding in between the teeth, or pasting the tongue, or tucked into tonsil folds. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But ignore all that.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Get down to the basics.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Study the structure of the face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There is not one person alive who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face is symmetrical. There is always, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 always}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , some feature which started growing in the wrong direction as a child and just kept going. Or maybe it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t grow fast enough to keep up with the rest of it. Titled noses. Slanted jaws. Most common is the uneven eyes, or uneven brows. Sometimes the whole face circumnavigates around to one side, and so you see more of one cheek than the other. Or perhaps it was smushed that way as it was squeezed out of the womb and it stuck like that, leaving the mentioned with a lopsided smile.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Truthfully, the only parts of the body Mandri liked to look at were the ones he generally wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t allowed to look at\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a cosmic cruelty, but one he didn\u8217\'92t fret about because he suspected that the only reason he liked to look at them was precisely because he wasn\u8217\'92t allowed to. He once was fascinated by the sparkling charm contained within the eye, but he spent so much time with them they\u8217\'92d lost their sparkle. And as it goes with eyes, so it goes with everything.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Still, a beautiful woman has a numbing effect. Mandri had to work a little harder to discover their ugliness. Moteah was as beautiful as he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen in a while, but he was certain that if he got close enough, if he got a whiff of her breath, so to speak, then the illusion that she was something more than a walking, talking leather sack of flesh would crumble.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Still, she had no obvious tells.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sat there in the sand, hands idle, studying Moteah as she put together her pack of unimportant things. She fit the standard rule of thumb for beauty that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s taught to artists at an early age\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 don\u8217\'92t make too many marks. People start to look ugly if you have to make too many marks to bring out the features. If Mandri were to paint Moteah with as few marks as possible, he wouldn\u8217\'92t be lying all that much. Since it was dark, and Moteah\u8217\'92s skin was darker, he\u8217\'92d only need a few bright swoops to capture the sheen of the stars on her cheek and brow, on the fullness of her lips. Her nose was hardly there. Her ears? Tucked tight underneath her head wrap, thank god. And she never smiled, thank god for that too, not just because he was spared the sight of her flapping gums but because her stern features were tailor made for frowning.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In fact, she was frowning right now. She stood, hands on hips, in the timeless pose of the woman waiting for an idiot, and she was frowning.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She was frowning at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It took Mandri a moment to realize it, dark as the night sky was, but yes, she was frowning at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh, do you want me to carry something?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re carrying the Mazyd.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright,\u8221\'94 and then he stood up, and walked over to where Obo was resting. The Mazyd had a gag tied over his mouth. Mandri picked him up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah sighed and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Use the frame.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was wooden, L-shaped frame fitted with straps sitting next to Obo. It was the same device morning walkers used to carry sacks of grain. He tied Obo in and set it on his shoulders. The frame was the perfect size for his scrawny back, and it had a waist strap that pulled fast around his hips, and that kept Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s weight resting kindly on top of them. Altogether it was a bargain, for Obo couldn\u8217\'92t have weighed more than forty pounds. Moteah\u8217\'92s pack, in comparison, looked like it weighed a hundred.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thought he\u8217\'92d be heavier,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you can carry more...\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, no. No. It\u8217\'92s more than heavy enough for me. Let\u8217\'92s head out, shall we?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The hastening dark made it hard to read the Moteah flicked her brows in, then she wandered off to follow Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s footprints leading out east.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you fall behind and make me double back, I\u8217\'92ll kill you myself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh I won\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93I think I\u8217\'92ll make it. My leg feels much better thanks to Purl. Hopefully we don\u8217\'92t have a long ways to go.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Ullr Basin lies a hundred miles east of here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what, ten days?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That depends on Ayram\u8217\'92s mood. Have you ever walked for ten days straight?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Doesn\u8217\'92t seem so bad.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked to see if they were following one of those old Charnel Roads that Moto had talked about, but if it was there he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see it. No gentle hump in the earth stretching off into the horizon. It was flat, and flat, and flat, and in the hazy distance, .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should be wearing Kell oil,\u8221\'94 Moteah said. She pointed up at the sun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t have any.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s some tied to my pack.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah stopped walking to let Mandri fish skin the of kell oil from her pack.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Coolness as the air hits the moisture on his skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, \u8220\'93you don\u8217\'92t strike me as a\u8230\'85 how should I put this\u8230\'85 You don\u8217\'92t strike me as someone who belongs out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And why is that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93For starters, you have all your teeth. And the way you talk, the way you act, the way you look... you don\u8217\'92t seem like a person who would thrive out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put it back if you\u8217\'92re done with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, and then he tied the skin of Kell oil back to Moteah\u8217\'92s pack. Once done, Moteah started walking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Also, you should eat something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t have anything to eat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Here,\u8221\'94 Moteah fished into her and pulled out a wafer of hard spekky bread; a .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri took it from her chased after her. Could feel Mazydobo bobbing behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I mean what\u8217\'92s your story, you and Moto? Neither of you seem like you belong out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course I don\u8217\'92t. Look at me. But even so I\u8217\'92d say I\u8217\'92m more . I\u8217\'92m killed. I was killed. I was tossed out into the desert like trash. That\u8217\'92s what belongs out here, people who don\u8217\'92t have much use.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His leg felt fine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nobody belongs in the desert,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about the outland tribes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They stick to oases and the wells they carve out of the ground, not the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, it is not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about the Jeketian Fathers?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about them?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They lived in the desert. And people still live like them, they go and seek out caves, and, I don\u8217\'92t know, try to cleanse the Spark or something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That not what the Jeketian Fathers did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See, the fact that you even know that proves that you\u8217\'92ve had some education. And educated people don\u8217\'92t belong out in the desert. They belong in cities, where there\u8217\'92s things to learn and teach. This desert is a place for people like me, people like the Fathers, people like outland tribes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Again, no outland tribe }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 wants}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to live in the desert. They live near water, and they get pushed into the desert. It was the same for the Jeketian Fathers.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well that still fits with my general point. If they\u8217\'92re outcasts, then they belong to the desert. You, however, I refuse to believe that you\u8217\'92re an outcast. I bet you could wed a Hrkan prince.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The look she gave him. Oooh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not saying you should! I\u8217\'92m just saying, you know\u8230\'85 Look, I know the standards for the kind of people they accept, and you\u8217\'92d fit right in. But the desert, it\u8217\'92s a place for people who don\u8217\'92t have a place. It\u8217\'92s the undesirables, it\u8217\'92s the bandits, the barbarians, and then the saintly folk, like the Fathers. People not fit for the horde.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t know anything about the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s there to know? It\u8217\'92s hot. There\u8217\'92s sand. And clay. No water.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah reaches down and tosses him a bulbous root.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s this?\u8221\'94}

I kid you not, I watched a Sulay man argue, well, not argue, it was more like he was spitting rage, claiming as he did that there was an untouched remnant of the Sulay tribe that needed taming.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah stopped walking. She pointed off to her left, at an unremarkable patch of scrub.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked. He braced himself for a bit of folksy desert wisdom.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hook flies swarm like that because the most interesting thing in all the world is each other.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah gave Mandri a quick smile of questionable sincerity, and then she walked off to join the trail of Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Mandri was stuck looking at those flies. Well, not the flies, he was stuck on Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s metaphor. Like most metaphors, it had a surface charm that suggested a deeper truth, but it completely broke down the more he thought it through. Those flies weren\u8217\'92t flying around in a ball because of the fulfillment they got in developing personal relationships with their fellows. There were, no doubt, more primal interests at play. Maybe they\u8217\'92d found water there in that bush, or food, or the bush broke the wind, making it easier to fly in the first place. Most likely it was about sex. They bunch up into a ball like that because it\u8217\'92s the easiest way to bump their little uglies into something that feels right.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That would be apt metaphor for people, Mandri supposed. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be easy to get away with saying that the only thing that holds a city together is lust.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked after Moteah, and she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d already gotten a ways away.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you trying to kill Solraheen? He\u8217\'92s the one bright light in this wretched world, so why kill him? Just to spite the Hrks?\u8221\'94}
