He drank the prince\u8217\'92s wine, stuffed his face with peach chicken potstickers and prickled lizard pluck, all while admiring the paintings of the Lady Fremel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri liked Fremel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s work. He didn\u8217\'92t love it. She was decent. Her finished product required a little more finishing. But she was a painter\u8217\'92s painter, and a painter\u8217\'92s painter is only appreciated by other painters, which unfortunately means that the subtleties of her brush were completely lost on the Hrkan elite and so her tremendous talent went largely overlooked. Mandri saw in her a kindred spirit. He was inspired by almost everything she did, and that included how she died: she killed herself by jumping from a balcony that overlooked the sea. Mandri had scribbled a few compositions of that, the moment just before the jump\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the lady standing precarious on a stone banister, her waist-length hair wind-blown against her figure as if it were a dress\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but he could never find someone who was willing to put up the funds for the finished piece.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 On one of those lazy days spent idling around in Eruhd\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s halls, Mandri saw a curious sight: a Hrkan general was admiring Fremel\u8217\'92s paintings. The old general stopped to contemplate each piece, a curious sight, because this general was a rough and tumble man who\u8217\'92d clearly risen up from the ranks, a battle hardened freak who looked more likely to chew on the canvas than step back and admire its deft use of color. He was not exactly the usual foppish wimp that makes a show of art appreciation. And this general struck his most thoughtful pose before Fremel\u8217\'92s greatest work, a painting was titled, \u8220\'93The Shadow of Goriol Valley\u8221\'94. Mandri wanted to know what the man thought about it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s take was that the painting was a work of meager genius, as he could not, at that time, admit that anyone was actually a true genius, not until he saw Ayram twirl his iron spear. But the painting was good. It was a view from the low Goriol Valley trail, looking up at the ridgeline which sheltered the valley from the eastern winds. The sun was setting behind that ridge, and so most of the scene was covered in shadow; blues, purples and muddy greys that seem almost red against the cooler hues. Nearer the bottom, in the middle distance, was a sinuous, slow flowing creek. Blood-red water. That\u8217\'92s the first thing the viewer sees as one walks towards the painting from afar, for not only is the creek spotlighted by the sun peeking over the ridge, but the composition is structured in such a way that the eye is drawn to a stepping-stone waterfall that\u8217\'92s set on a golden third. Below this waterfall, bobbing in its pool, is a brown lump of something. Step a little closer to the painting and it becomes clear that this lump is a face-down, lifeless body. Then dawns the realization that the water isn\u8217\'92t just blood-red, stained as such by clay or vegetable matter, it is literally blood, for the shadowed valley slopes above is covered by a carpet of corpses.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One almost has to squint to see the bodies, but they are there, soldiers all, crumpled over each other like a storm from the Abari highlands had ripped through the valley and dumped them there. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The General said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think this is the worst painting ever made.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri would have laughed, but the man was being completely serious.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri would have tried to school him, but the man was who he was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri briefly considered walking away, but soon he found himself asking, against his better judgment, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why don\u8217\'92t you like the piece?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And who are you?\u8221\'94 The general said. Mandri didn\u8217\'92t have the station to request a clarification of thought.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, I just help keep the place clean,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, \u8220\'93But, this is one of my favorite paintings. Why don\u8217\'92t you like it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It makes a mockery of war,\u8221\'94 said the General. \u8220\'93Whoever painted this has never truly seen a battle.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, does it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The General said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you described to a child what happened in the Goriol Valley, and had them paint it, this is what you\u8217\'92d get. Obviously, it\u8217\'92s much prettier than what a child could do, but what this is, is childish.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri smirked. The general noticed. The man drew up such contempt that Mandri wondered if he were about to order an arrest and torture. Generals still had that kind of power even if the ascent of the Mazydai had long made battlefield tactics obsolete.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But what could be childish about a mound of bodies? Fremel had handled the subject seriously. The scene was gruesome, but not obscenely so. What was there to upset a Hrkan general? No doubt he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen a mound of bodies before. Probably, he\u8217\'92d ordered them made. Perhaps he was suffering a bout of guilt and, being too manly to take responsibility for his actions, assumed that the artist was somehow attacking him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then again, Fremel wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t at the Goriol valley and she\u8217\'92d never seen a hill of corpses. Neither had Mandri. He\u8217\'92d seen dead bodies in the singular, and there was nothing profound about it, but perhaps a bloated body became profound if it was piled up on top of twenty others. He always assumed he would never know. Then the battle at Minting Rock happened and a good seventy something Hrkans died, twenty Ayramun as well, and when it was over, Ayram directed whoever was left to gather up the dead, Hrk and Outland alike, and put them in a pile. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They were to be piled into the shape of a sphere. Mandri was not told why it should be a sphere instead of a regular old pile. And because a pile of bodies does not naturally take a sphere\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shape, Mandri was conscripted to construct a large bowl out of the rocky rubble. Mandri spent the afternoon building that giant bowl, and he did a terrible job. When the bodies were eventually tossed in, they didn\u8217\'92t make sphere, they made a regular old lump. Thankfully, no one seemed to care. The mood was too grim for anyone to get angry. Ayram especially was more concerned with the complete and utter failure his plans had come to. And  . It wasn\u8217\'92t just the recently mangled here, there were also those dessicated giants, the ones that had been tucked away inside of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s tombs for who knows how many centuries. In the collapse they\u8217\'92d split apart like twigs and whatever was found of them was tossed on top of pile like kindling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 By twilight it was all finished and Mandri was allowed to creep away and rest against a heap of rocks. There he sat, alone, munching on some Hrkan hardtack, and his thoughts turned to that painting of the Goriol Valley and the General\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chiding critique\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 childish, he\u8217\'92d called it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This pile of dead did not resemble what Fremel had painted. There was significantly less blood, and Fremel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dead bodies were more seductive, though that was just how people were painted, living or dead. Her bodies were well-muscled and well-naked, or half-naked, and they looked like they\u8217\'92d just stepped out of a bath instead of choking each-other in the mud. It was a typical dramatic device\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the perfection of youth cut down before their time\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but Fremel\u8217\'92s message went further than that, for Fremel came from a school of artists who thought they had important things to say. Fremel\u8217\'92s battlefield lay strewn with naked men lying upon naked men. They\u8217\'92ve all come down from their passionate trance, where reason gave way to baser instinct, where they wrestled, where their limbs tangled and their weapons, phallic, penetrating, stabbed into slits that bleed. It\u8217\'92s all quite blunt and homoerotic, with eyes rolled back, jaws slack, because ecstasy and death look quite the same and so does war and sex\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 if both sides aren\u8217\'92t satisfied they go at it again until everyone is utterly spent.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri surveyed the rubble of Minting Rock, as well as his own memory of what had transpired, and he wondered, to what extent could all of this be compared to an outburst sexual tension?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was, when the battle first ended, a shared sense of exhilaration. Ayram put on an incredible performance. But this excitement did not last long as the counted dead . When Seb relayed the story about how Forty leaped into the fray just before Minting Rock split in two, the mood careened into a fog of gloom. Forty\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body was never found, and that made it even worse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chopper\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s death was most unfortunate. He\u8217\'92d live through the collapse, but in a fit of chop-lust he sprinted towards the Hrkan soldiers while Ayram was fighting them, and he did not see Ayram\u8217\'92s spear on the follow-through. It hit him in the chest, broke his sternum, and he was dead before he hit the ground. This was the only death that seemed to perturb Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob had been unlucky. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d survived the first half of Minting Rock splitting off, but from the way that Moto told it, the second half\u8217\'92s collapse sent a leg-sized shard of stone whistling down from the rock\u8217\'92s highest room. If Tob had been standing a step to either side, he would have been fine, instead, his body lay flat on the dirt and in the place of his head was that bloody spike of stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The witch Elrahet had, of course, survived, as witches always do. She was busy mumbling some witchy incantations as she laid hands on the pile of dead. Purl was helping Seb splint his hand which was starting to swell up like a wineskin. The rest of the surviving Ayramun\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram, Moto, and Moteah\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they were rushing around, trying to salvage what they could from the destruction. They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d already looted the dead. It weren\u8217\'92t seeking valuables, the were seeking anything that took longer than a day to make and could be packed up and carried; cords, ropes, belts, bags, all liquids and foodstuffs\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Hrks had brought plenty with them, wrapped  up in neat packages, , organized to , a kind of care they didn\u8217\'92t show the bodies themselves. When Moteah got to Tob, she went through the pockets of his robe as if he were a lizard and she were digging through his guts for the pluck. The only thing she found of interest was a pair of pouches tied together by a leather string\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Tob\u8217\'92s collection of lucky rocks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah dropped them as soon as she realized what they were. Then she muttered an unintelligible Zosan charm and rubbed her fingers in the dirt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Trying to brush the unluckiness off?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked from his perch atop flat-faced boulder. \u8220\'93I thought you didn\u8217\'92t believe in luck.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 said Moteah.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then what are you washing your hands for?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah stood up, hands on hips, and glared at Mandri like he was her child.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Make yourself useful. Search those bodies for satchels with Hrkan rations. We\u8217\'92re going to be leaving soon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And leave Tob like this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A shadow passed over Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face as she looked down upon her dead companion. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is not Tob,\u8221\'94 she said, and then she stepped aside and moved on to scrummage through the uniform of a dead Hrkan soldier.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri hopped down and picked up Tob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lucky rocks. These rocks were Tob\u8217\'92s life work. He thought it would seem a shame to leave them there to get buried by the Sand. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stooped and patted Tob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly, saying, \u8220\'93Sorry about all this. I\u8217\'92ll take good care of these things. You\u8217\'92ll live on in these rocks, I swear it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri took one rock from the \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91lucky\u8217\'92 pouch, and tucked it back into Tob\u8217\'92s robes, thinking that the man should be buried with at least one of them on the off chance that the Hrkan rhyme about the afterlife was true; }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \tab When you die, }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \tab The things you bring,}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \tab Are the clothes on your back,}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \tab And your wedding ring.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Since Tob wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t married, the only thing he had was his rocks. None of the dead Ayramun were married. Only Tob had rocks. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scratched his chin and wondered if Tob would have gone to each of the Ayramun and give them a lucky rock. He found it difficult to carry out the will a dead man when he don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know him all that well.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Did Tob even want him to have these rocks? It could be risky taking them, without assurances. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The only person he felt comfortable approaching with this issue was Purl. So, he walked over to where she was finishing up with Seb, and asked her straight, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you think Tob would want someone to have his lucky rocks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was Seb, not Purl, who answered. His manner was thick with the pretension. As usual. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If Tob didn\u8217\'92t want you to have them,\u8221\'94 Seb said, \u8220\'93Then they wouldn\u8217\'92t have been there for you to take.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sounds like comfort logic,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brows pinched into a scowl. \u8220\'93No, it\u8217\'92s not. It is the truth! Things happen because they are supposed to happen. If they weren\u8217\'92t supposed to happen they wouldn\u8217\'92t happen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl rolled her eyes. She gave Mandri a knowing glance, a flutter, knowing glance, lingering long enough to say, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You and me are the only real people in this conversation.\u8221\'94 It\u8217\'92s a look that\u8217\'92s meant to be a private aside, but she did it right in front of Seb, knowing he\u8217\'92d catch it, and when he did, his scowl turned into outright anger.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t roll your eyes at me, bitch!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll roll my eyes at whoever I want to roll my eyes at.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just because you can\u8217\'92t see the hand of god at work in the world, doesn\u8217\'92t mean it\u8217\'92s not there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri bore  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you guys ever hear the story about how the temple of Salamis stole the legs of the Lybion martyrs from the temple of Geetz?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What of it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The priests of Salamis said that the theft was justified because if Solraheen didn\u8217\'92t want Salamis to have such a sacred relic, then he wouldn\u8217\'92t have allowed such a theft to occur in the first place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And they were right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Priests stealing,\u8221\'94 Purl moaned. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what you get with comfort logic.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb moved to mandri, knowing Purl was a lost cause. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Those rocks are yours now Mandri. And they\u8217\'92re yours because you have them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Mandri mulled it over. If Moteah hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t put the rocks into his field of vision, he never would have thought about them otherwise. It was easy to imagine Tob\u8217\'92s lonely ghost hovering there above his corpse, compelling Moteah to pull the rocks from out of his robes, so that they might dangle there in the air like an ox\u8217\'92s uglies.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Maybe Seb was right. The proof that Tob gave the rocks to him was that he had them. That was the kind of circular thinking Mandri would have to accept if he was going to take the prophecy of the Incompetent Painter seriously.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He was lucky because he was alive, and he was alive because he was lucky.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He survived because he had a destiny, and he had a destiny because he survived. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was a certain freedom in just accepting it. A certain dry logic, too. Then there was the fact that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d miraculously escaped death four times over now. At a certain point, after the miracle stack up,  .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So these rocks are useless then.\u8221\'94 Mandri said as he weighed the pouches in his hand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Seb asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What makes you say that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If what is going to happen is going to happen, then luck doesn\u8217\'92t come into it. Tob couldn\u8217\'92t change his luck with lucky rocks, and I can\u8217\'92t change mine. We\u8217\'92re all going to end up how we\u8217\'92re going to end up and that\u8217\'92s that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl looks up with a skeptical look. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is this about that whole \u8216\'91Painted Eunuch\u8217\'92 thing?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 Mandri said defensively.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob eye\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lit up. \u8220\'93What painted eunuch thing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s nothing,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri thinks he\u8217\'92s some prophetic eunuch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a eunuch?\u8221\'94 asked Tob.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob eyed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s groin with some concern.  \u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s see your uglies then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not showing you my... It isn\u8217\'92t about a eunuch. You can interpret the prophecy a bunch of different ways.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A eunuch only means one thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, the prophecy was written in Old Jandri, and the way it\u8217\'92s written-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tob interrupted Mandri with a revelation. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that what you were doing dead in our ravine? Trying to fulfill some prophecy?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Like I told Purl, I was killed and then dumped there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t lie,\u8221\'94 Purl said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not lying. A lunatic killed me thinking that I might be the Painted Eunuch, and according to him, the only way to be sure was to kill me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To see if you\u8217\'92d survive it.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was vibing with the logic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t encourage him,\u8221\'94 Purl said. Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t sure who she was talking to.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb seemed to think she was speaking to him. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If young Mandram does have a prophesied future, then he needs no encouragement from me. He is who he is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Brilliant,\u8221\'94 Purl said derisively. \u8220\'93Profound wisdom from Seb the Broken. \u8216\'91He is who he is\u8217\'92. Mmhmm.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you told Ayram about all this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why would I?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because Ayram is superstitious man and he wants to know what Mandri was doing in the ravine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl sh}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then lets go! I want to see what he thinks of this.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hoooold on. As far as I\u8217\'92m concerned, I have nothing to do with this whole Painted Eunuch thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, you\u8217\'92ve got something to do with something!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This last profundity snapped something in Purl, and she smacked the ground with her pack and challenged Seb, saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You do understand that the words coming out of your mouth don\u8217\'92t mean anything, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb grinned. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll see what Ayram has to say.\u8221\'94 He then stood up, put his crusty hand on the back of Mandri\u8217\'92s neck, and led him away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb led Mandri up and over a pile of rocks, around a pile of bodies, and there was Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The giant was sitting on wooden stool, back turned, and the witch Elrahet was checking his body for wounds. The stool squeaked and groaned every time Ayram shifted his weight, but the himself was perfectly silent as the old witch sewed up a thin gash that wrapped around his side. As she worked, she washed away the dust from his skin with a wet rag, revealing a tightly sculpted body - skin, muscle, and bone, not an ounce of fat, skinny and strong, like a dehydrated lizard. Every time Ayram lifted his arm, the striations in his shoulders popped and his shoulder blade melted into a pool of rippling muscle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should be getting ready,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled when he heard Seb and Mandri approaching.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb ducked under the words with a reverent bow. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a thing you should know about Mandri here. About what he was doing in the ravine where we found him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet snapped, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t have time for this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb raised his bandaged hand and prodded the air with his one good finger. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri says he\u8217\'92s part of some prophecy about a eunuch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram peeked over his shoulder with a questioning eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What prophecy?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb guided Mandri around to Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s front and waved him on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stood there, wilting under the weight of Ayrams glare. The tips of his beard were greased in blood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Explain,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri took a deep breath.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can I just say that, I\u8217\'92m not personally invested in any prophecy. The truth is that I\u8217\'92m just a poor farmer who was killed by the governor of Meskalim. The man was insane. He believed that I was something called the Painted Eunuch, and he said that the only way to be sure that I am the Painted Eunuch, was to kill me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb picked up the slack, saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because if Mandri survived death, than that means he\u8217\'92s bound for a greater destiny. And look what we\u8217\'92ve done - risen him from the dead. Maybe he is this Painted Eunuch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram leaned forward and set his elbows on his knees. He looked Mandri up and down and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s not a eunuch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri opened his mouth to explain, but before he could, the old witch Elrahet popped out from behind Ayram. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The prophecy of the Painted Eunuch can be interpreted in a number of ways,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93The Old Jandri word for \u8216\'91eunuch\u8217\'92 is the same as the word for \u8216\'91impotent\u8217\'92. Or \u8216\'91failure\u8217\'92. Or \u8216\'91incompetent\u8217\'92. Some say beware the Painted Eunuch, others the Eunuch Painter. Or, mayhaps, it is the Failed Painter. You say you are a farmer, Mandri, but did you ever want to be a painter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, I\u8217\'92m something of a painter. That\u8217\'92s the thing that got Salavan all heated. I wouldn\u8217\'92t say I\u8217\'92m a failed painter, though.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb wagged his finger at Mandri accusingly. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just now you claimed you were a farmer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I, uh\u8230\'85 it\u8217\'92s a long story.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet chuckled. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A painter working as a farmer is a failed painter. No one chooses to slave away in a field, not in Meskalim of all places.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said it with such conviction that even he believed it. Though it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t enough. All three of the Ayramun looked at him with suspicion. Ayram most of all. The man\u8217\'92s gaze was . Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t hold for even a flutter of a heartbeat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram asked Elrahet, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this Painted Eunuch supposed to do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There are a hundred different prophesies fortelling how The Enemy shall awaken from his tormented slumber. The Painted Eunuch is one of them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s suspicion turned to disbelief.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This boy will be the one to arouse Schisol?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Indeed - IF he is the Painted Eunuch. And IF the prophecy is true.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri could really feel their stares boring into him. Seb was grinning, reveling in the awkwardness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Would it help if I promised not to do it?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram defers to Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you think?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said as she began to pace around in a little circle. As she walked she scuffed the dirt with the sandals, kicking small stones out in front of her.  Before finally declaring, \u8220\'93Ancient prophecies aren\u8217\'92t worth much. If he is or if he isn\u8217\'92t, it doesn\u8217\'92t matter. What matters is that it\u8217\'92s another sign of the changing tide. Plans are coming to a head. Schisol\u8217\'92s idiots are stirring. If they\u8217\'92ve gotten up as high as governor, then I\u8217\'92m sure they\u8217\'92ll try something stupid soon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then we cannot give up on the Mazyd,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet nodded in agreement. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We may not get another chance.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram sighed and his shoulders slumped. He sat like that for a , then he slapped his knees and he was back to his old absurd confidence. He stood up, twisted back and forth to test the stitchwork that riddled his side, and when this sent a thin stream of blood dribbling down his ribs, he ripped a long, thin strip of wool from a white Hrkan cloak and bandaged himself up . While he was tying the knot, he pointed with his chin towards two small corpses that were laying face down in the dirt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Grab those and bring them here,\u8221\'94 he said, speaking to Seb and Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb pulled at Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sleeve and the two of them trotted over to the corpses and picked them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One was the Mazydariga child. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The other was Mazydobo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They carried them back to where Ayram stood, and set them down at his feet. Then Elrahet waddled over and shooed Seb and Mandri away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The old witch straightened the corpses out so that they looked like resting angels next to eachother, flat on their backs, and then she knelt in between their heads, making sure the layers of her robeskirt folded nicely to make a pillow for her bony knees. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In her hands was golden blade. It flashed in the light of the sun as she held it up, she said, for the elder gods to see.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The sight of that dagger turned Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach. He\u8217\'92d seen one like it before, in the grip of that demon witch who\u8217\'92d swallowed his ox\u8217\'92s soul. The two blades were almost exactly alike; maybe they were the very same, Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t be sure. He\u8217\'92d thought that witch who\u8217\'92d chased him off his field was one of a kind, yet here was Elrahet, and while Elrahet hadn\u8217\'92t sprouted fangs, and didn\u8217\'92t fly around as if possessed by the wind, there was that same devilish excitement in the air.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was feeling it too. His jaw hung loose and his eyes were alight with wonder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram had crossed his arms, apparently uninterested in , but the hairs on his forearms stood on end and his pink bottom lip was tense inside that greasy bushel of a beard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Elrahet next spoke, with her head craned towards the sky, the speech that ushered from her lungs was so polluted with guttural urks that Mandri wondered if they were even words. Not even the croaks of vomiting toads sounded so much like gibberish.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t gibberish, it couldn\u8217\'92t be, for the words pulled a shimmering, red smoke from out of the witch\u8217\'92s throat. The smoke wisped and curled like smoke from a candle flame, sending tendrils to wrap around the tip of the golden blade. Then, suddenly, Elrahet slammed the dagger down into Riga\u8217\'92s belly, burying it up to the hilt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s when Mandri realized that the poor Riga child was still alive. It must have been drugged, for it could not speak or cry in anguish. It could only spit out blood. Then its body shuddered and it\u8217\'92s feet spasmed, its toes then curled, and its legs jerked. Elrahet pushed down on the Riga\u8217\'92s hips with her free hand to steady the creature, and when the jerking finally settled down, Elrahet ripped the blade from the stomach, bent over the wound, then set her lips upon it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wanted to look away, but he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t. Such is the allure of dark and twisted things. It made Mandri queasy, and still he couldn\u8217\'92t look away as witch slurped up blood and viscera from the hole in the Riga\u8217\'92s belly. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d had her fill, she pulled her head away from the Riga\u8217\'92s corpse, mouth shut tight, withered lips painted red with blood, and she swung around to kiss the lips of Mazydobo. She pried his mouth open, and spit what was in her mouth into his - blood, and a dim blue light, the same light that Mandri had seen zip out of Obo\u8217\'92s body when the Mazydariga whistled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Elrahet shut Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw, clenched it tight with her leathery palm, and set her ear against his heart. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She closed her eyes and listened.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A stillness settled over those gathered there, and }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fetch Purl!\u8221\'94 the witch said. \u8220\'93Quick!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri winced as Ayram yelled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93PUUURRRRL!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A heartbeat later, and Purl came running into the clearing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is it?\u8221\'94 Purl asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet pointed to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest and said, \u8220\'93Wake it up!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What? What do you mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There isn\u8217\'92t much time! Wake up the Mazydai!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl hurried over and knelt next to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do I do?\u8221\'94 she asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t make the creature. Will him awake! Or Something!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know what to do!\u8221\'94 Purl said as her flustered hands waved in the air, \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t even know what\u8217\'92s going on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet grabbed Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stubby left arm}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Try pumping your fist to start his heart.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 These words seemed to clarify the situation for Purl, and her confusion gave way, , to stern look of concentration.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t help but imagine Purl\u8217\'92s missing hand squeezing away at some misshapen heart in Obo\u8217\'92s chest, her dainty fingers clutching a hollow slug of a muscle, with a tangle of veins and arteries floating in an amnioticky goo. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Squeeze.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Squeeze.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And squeeze.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then, to the astonishment of all, Obo opened his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The sudden movement startled Purl and she stumbled back on her butt. Elrahet sent a shriek of thanks to the heavens, and Ayram }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Welcome back,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He reached down and picked the Obo up with one hand, and set the Mazyd sitting against a boulder. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mayzdobo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes were misted over. He was still coming to. Even so, he found the strength to speak. He said to Ayram, in his usual way, \u8220\'93The urge to gloat must be fierce.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram just stares him down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s nothing to gloat about here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo looked around as his head lolled about, and took in the scene. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said you\u8217\'92d all die, you said you\u8217\'92d win. You were right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram is like, this fucking guy.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl runs up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Make him do something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Make him bark like a dog.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl assumed the stance of a. Said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bark. Like a dog.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo smiled, and in the most plainly human way, said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you make him do that?\u8221\'94 Ayram asked Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think so.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Unsatisfied with Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s degree of certainty, Ayram turned to Mazydobo and asked him instead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did she make you do that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was still smiling. He was missing a bottom tooth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am not sure how to answer that,\u8221\'94 said he.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Answer with the truth.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The truth is that if the girl didn\u8217\'92t tell me to bark like a dog, I never would have barked.\u8221\'94 Obo eyed Ayram and Purl , in obvious if they were picking up what he was putting down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was Elrahet who spoke up. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Was her command sufficient cause to compel you to speak?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet then said Purl, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Make him do something by thinking it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What should I make him do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Anything!\u8221\'94 exclaimed Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl shrunk under Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s , and took a deep breath to focus her nerves, and whistled it out through pursed lips. When she opened her eyes again, she was the perfect picture of composure. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A faint hum in the air. From whence it came, Mandri could not tell. There was a north-easterly breeze which was not there before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl reached out with her handless wrist, and then Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s bald head twitched. and his shoulders crimped then a golden glow began to shine through his pale throat and he opened his mouth towards the heavens.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri expected to see a blast of sunfire issue forth, but nothing came. A heartbeat later, and Obo regained control of his senses.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I must admit, you almost had me there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram crosses his arms.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s good enough for now.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you not learned anything from this day? Even if the girl could control me, you must see how I\u8217\'92ll be of no use to you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you mean.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have two problems. First, it is still an open question as to whether or not the girl can control me. Ask me? She never will. Second, even if she could, there\u8217\'92s still the issue of the Mazydariga. As you have seen, one whistle from a Riga and I go as limp as a noodle.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb piped up from his in next to Mandri. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s a good point,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram gave Seb a hushing look, then asked Obo. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How many Mazydariga are there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do not know,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93More than you can handle would be a rough estimation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram grunted in Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s direction. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is it you want me to do?\u8221\'94 Obo asked. \u8220\'93Do you plan to use me to drive Hrk\u8217\'92s armies into the sea? Lay waste to every Hrkan temple?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no point in telling him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should!\u8221\'94 Obo agreed. \u8220\'93I am good at scheming. That is literally what I\u8217\'92m made for. Tell me your goals, the more specific, the better. What do you want to accomplish?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet saw Ayram considering it, then decided to intervene.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We can\u8217\'92t trust the creature,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t trust him,\u8221\'94 Ayram said with conviction. \u8220\'93But either he says something sensible, or we simply ignore him. I don\u8217\'92t see the harm in telling him what we plan to do. The Mazydariga clearly want to kill him as much as us. Maybe he\u8217\'92s got an idea of how to avoid them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet skeptical glare.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d rather move on with a plan than run blindly into a nest of battles.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram turns to Mazydobo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wish to use you to kill Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Silence.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m confused. Is there some Lord who has taken to calling himself Solraheen?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There is only one Solraheen,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazydobo looked at each of the Ayramun to gauge their intent. So did Mandri. What Ayram was saying was absurd, even for a man such as he. One can\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t simply a god.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo then said what Mandri was thinking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t be serious.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But Ayram was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wish to smuggle you into Jeket, sneak you down in the cavern temple, then have you open your mouth and spit your sunfire into Solraheen\u8217\'92s eye. I want you to end him as you can end a rock. Your sunfire erases things from existence.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Stunned.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You asked for a goal, not a motivation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But this is the age of Hrk. Solraheen is merely a figurehead. You do understand that he\u8217\'92s stuck under a mountain of rock, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He can\u8217\'92t move. They keep him so drugged up on havi fumes that he can\u8217\'92t talk. Why risk everything for a symbolic victory?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It isn\u8217\'92t symbolic.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure, killing him might stir up chaos for a few years, but it won\u8217\'92t do a thing to change the balance of power in Jandri. Hrk will remain Hrk, and whatever side you\u8217\'92re on will still look and feel like this.\u8221\'94 Obo motioned around him to the devastation that was Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram was unperturbed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can you think of a way to elude these demon children and get you down into the tunnels of Jeket?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Please, for your own sakes, stop and consider: what is the one thing the Hrkan Lords are scared of?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You?\u8221\'94 Elrahet said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, yes, but in normal circumstances, no. In fact, we Mazydai we were created to massage that one thing that checks Hrkan power, and that\u8217\'92s the people of the Hrkan nation. There is no more destructive power on this earth than when the Hrkan people get angry all at once. And right now, they don\u8217\'92t care about the outland tribes. They don\u8217\'92t care about you. There\u8217\'92s sympathy there, if you can believe it. Kill their god, and it won\u8217\'92t be hard for the Lords to whip them up into frenzy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram chuckled and shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know what the Hrkan people are capable of.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why agitate them?\u8221\'94 Obo asked. The force of his argument was working an energy into him. \u8220\'93If you want Hrk to fall, you have to be more surgical. There are strong internal divisions within Hrk. Apply some pressure to the right places, and you can irritate those divisions. Get the factions within Hrk to hate eachother. That\u8217\'92s the easiest way to conquer a nation, simply get them to no longer want to be a nation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You speak as if from experience.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m a student of history. How do you think Hrk absorbed its tribes? What I can say from experience is this: getting people to hate eachother is the easiest thing to do. Disagreement is a natural reflex for your kind. Prey on that with a bit of coin and it starts a death spiral that feeds itself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t care about Hrk,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. \u8220\'93What I want to do is destroy the body of Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See, you say you want to do that, but killing Solraheen strikes me as a means to an end than rather than the end itself. If you tell me your desired ends, I might be able to find a less risky way of achieving it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My desired end is Solraheen\u8217\'92s.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why use me? Why not just make a giant cleaver and drop it on his neck?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It would grow back.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Would it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram nodded. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s been tried.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s been tried.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure. Whatever. But why are you so certain that my sunfire will do the trick?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not. Nonetheless, I wish to try.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo smiled and laughed in disbelief. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine!\u8221\'94 he said, relenting. \u8220\'93Fine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can you think of away around the Mazydariga.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93First thing\u8217\'92s first, there\u8217\'92s the simple issue of: I don\u8217\'92t want to do this. You shouldn\u8217\'92t have told me. I\u8217\'92m going to do everything in my limited power to prevent you from achieving your goal.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet glared at Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram shrugged off her, crossed his arms, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not worried about what you want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should be,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93Because your choice of Purl as Minder was a poor one. You should have gone with yourself, Ayram. You might be a capable Minder, but then again, that\u8217\'92s only a \u8216\'91might be\u8217\'92 and I\u8217\'92m not sure you\u8217\'92d want to risk losing your hand for no reward. The only other option is your old witch, Elrahet. I\u8217\'92m actually quite certain she\u8217\'92d be able to do it. I don\u8217\'92t understand why you didn\u8217\'92t use her in the first place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She needs her hands.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In that case, it\u8217\'92s either hope Purl magically develops some resolve, or, and this was always possible, pay attention to what I want. Give me what I want, and I\u8217\'92ll gladly go along with all this. Without complaint.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is it you want?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What I want is something that elegantly solves the problem of the Mazydariga. And that\u8217\'92s why I know this is the option you\u8217\'92ll choose, because the most elegant solution demands application.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get on with it,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One distant whistle and the Mazydariga sucks the artificial Spark from my body, rendering me inert. And Jeket is crawling with Mazydariga, so even if you could control me, the Riga will have found me long before we reach Solraheen\u8217\'92s chamber. But if you give me what I want, none of this will be a problem.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said get to it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want my freedom. I want my own true Spark. I want to be sustained by my own will. If I have my own shard of the divine, then I would be free from the Mazydariga\u8217\'92s influence, free from a Minder\u8217\'92s influence, and in return for this grand gesture, I would do as you wish, I will kill Solraheen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stroked his beard. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And how do I get you a Spark?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was awake in the cave when your Elrahet put a Spark in Mandrameen\u8217\'92s body.\u8221\'94 Obo waved towards Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I did not believe such a thing was possible,\u8221\'94 Obo said, \u8220\'93Yet there he is. If Elrahet could infuse Mandrameen\u8217\'92s inanimate matter with a Spark, then perhaps she could do the same for me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram looks over to his witch and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can this be done?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet steps closer.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A Mazyd is a different kind of creature for which no true Spark exists. Giving him one would require an act of divine creation, and that is a power known only to the gods.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well then, if it can\u8217\'92t be done-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I did not say it couldn\u8217\'92t be done.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ears pricked up. There was an implication in Elrahet\u8217\'92s statement that . As Elrahet loomed over Obo\u8217\'92s diminutive form.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me, creature, if I grant you a Spark, what would stop you from killing us? What would stop you from going back on your word?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothing,\u8221\'94 Obo admitted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet turned again to Ayram. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We can\u8217\'92t trust the creature. We\u8217\'92re better off stumbling blind through the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I understand your concern,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93Solraheen gave humanity a Spark, and now you set out to repay that kindness by killing him. You\u8217\'92re worried I\u8217\'92ll get the same idea.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why wouldn\u8217\'92t you?\u8221\'94 Elrahet spat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93As you say, we are different kinds of creatures. Don\u8217\'92t project your own failings onto me.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram pulled Elrahet away from Obo, as she was about to smack him in the face with her cane. Ayram assured her with a knowing grin and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Damned will be the day that I trust the Mazydai to honor words.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If there is no other option for dealing with the Mazydariga, then there is nothing left for us to discuss.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo held Ayram back with a wave of his hand. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There is one other option,\u8221\'94 he claimed. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s just not as elegant as the first. Actually it was in your grasp just now, but true to form, you\u8217\'92ve managed to squander the opportunity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 See how is insult lands.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Out with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know this for certain, but I assume that when a Mazydariga is in possession of my pseudo-spark, my lifeless body becomes untraceable. Presumably, you could capture a Riga after it disables me, then you could walk right into Jeket with my corpse, unmolested. Then, standing before Solraheen, you could reanimate me as you\u8217\'92ve done just now, then carry on with your wanton act of deicide.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb stepped forward again, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wait, are you saying that we could have-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram interrupted Seb with a brusque tsk, then said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92d have to keep the Riga alive. We\u8217\'92d have to carry him all the way to Jeket. We\u8217\'92d be trading smuggling you for smuggling a Riga child. It\u8217\'92s one problem for another.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Again, I\u8217\'92m not completely certain of this, but I don\u8217\'92t think the Mazydariga can track each other the way they can track us Mazydai.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb stepped forward again. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d almost reached the conversation. \u8220\'93So we could have walked right into the Jeket if we hadn\u8217\'92t just-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram cut Seb short a third time, and the grim look on his face told Seb there would not be a fourth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo answered Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s question anyways. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t see why not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t as concerned with having unwittingly lost the keys to victory.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If we\u8217\'92ve captured a Riga once, we can do it again.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo tilted his head as if he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quite heard right. He said, \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not confident that you can afford another Minting Rock.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To this, Ayram laughed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You said we couldn\u8217\'92t afford the first one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s a fair point. But unless you\u8217\'92ve got a small army of Ayramun stashed away for a rainy day, you lot won\u8217\'92t be able to stand up to what\u8217\'92s coming.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet said. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We have plenty of friends in the desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What you don\u8217\'92t have is time,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93More soldiers and rigas are on their way, and it won\u8217\'92t be a single column either.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram grabbed his spud bar and stepped out into the middle of the clearing, then wiped small circle of dirt clean with his foot. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How far out are they?\u8221\'94 He asked Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s three days march from the outpost at Shahiz.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shahiz\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Ayram mumbled as he drew a crude map in the dirt with his spud bar\u8217\'92s chisel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo added, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And once the all the Riga figure out that I am still on the loose, and that their comrade is dead, the troops at Shahiz will be the least of your worries. \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How long will it take for them to figure that out?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re children, so it may take a day or two for them to reason through the implications of my still-beating heart, but once they do figure out, every Hrkan army from here to the shalbrumont straight will be stirring. You\u8217\'92ve kicked a hornet\u8217\'92s nest.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram finished drawing the map and began to pace around it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where is the nearest Hrkan outpost to Carkoon?\u8221\'94 He asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Redrock,\u8221\'94 Obo answered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what, two days west of it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Three.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram added a dot and an arrow to his map. Elrahet stepped over and nearly spat. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you said you wouldn\u8217\'92t trust his word.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not.\u8221\'94 Ayram said. \u8220\'93I already know all this. I\u8217\'92m just seeing if he\u8217\'92d lie about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Was he lying?\u8221\'94 asked Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram erased his map with a flick of his foot, ignoring Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s question altogether.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It can be done,\u8221\'94 said. \u8220\'93We can make it to the bones of Ullr before the Hrkans get to us. It will be close, so we have to leave right now.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was not impressed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you wander into the Ullr basin\u8230\'85 It\u8217\'92s surrounded by Hrkan cites\u8230\'85 There will be no way out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know a place. We\u8217\'92ll use the Mazyd as bait to snatch another Riga, then we\u8217\'92ll waltz right into Jeket.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Into this peace, Moto and Moteah came strolling in, each carrying packs twice as big as themselves.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s going on?\u8221\'94 Moto asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re leaving,\u8221\'94 said Ayram, and then he and the others walked right on by the siblings, sparing little in the way of explanation. Ayram gave a perfunctory nod and that was it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet was the last to pass by. She stopped next Moto and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bring that cursed Mazyd with you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto then said to his sister, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You heard the woman, bring the Mazyd with you.\u8221\'94 Then he took off after Ayram, leaving Moteah, Mandri, and Mazydobo to sort it out.}
