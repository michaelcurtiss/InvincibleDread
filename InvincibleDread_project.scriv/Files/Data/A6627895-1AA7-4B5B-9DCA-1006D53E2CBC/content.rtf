\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Foul teeth. Foul breath. Foul words. But the foulness of it conveys a sense of reality, of certainty, of truth. Shiny white teeth and healthy smile would have no cause o call for the death of a man.  This was the earth itself and it could not be wrong.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle had a clubbed foot. He was old and bald and haggard. He had to gulp his sorrow before he spoke. He had lines in the tooth. He saw himself reflected in the rage. So he stood and screamed along with them. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One sharp yelp. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Death!\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd looked in his direction. The poor man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stare was broken. Understanding. Forgiveness. Even shame. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It locked Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw and he pooped his pants.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now, my purpose. For those of you that don\u8217\'92t know, \u8216\'91Mazydei\u8217\'92 means \u8216\'91lights\u8217\'92 in Carcinian tongue. Saulistides intended for them to be the light of the world, beacons of virtue for all men to follow. Not human - for human could be so perfect. }

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Sacrosanct kept secret just how many Mazydei there were at any given moment, but there weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t many. It should have been a great surprise to Pyetle to find himself locked in a cave cell with one of them. He was completely oblivious to the magnitude of the moment.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His only concern was his discomfort. His centuries-old cell had been hollowed out of the sandstone, but it retained a bulbous and natural shape, so there was no corner in which to tuck himself away. He was forced to sit right up close to this stranger, who was slumbering away in the dark. There was just enough light that Pyetle could make out that the man was almost nude was covered in dried blood. What\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s more is that he was missing his hands, and that on the stubs of his forearms were bandages so caked with glistening blood and pus that they were leaking. The poor wretch just lay there in the cool darkness, beaten and bloody, looking so much like a tortured soul from hell. The stench was haunting. Pyetle hardly dared to breathe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This was a regular outlaw, Pyetle assumed, a thief of thieves who was being punished for his crimes in brutal frontier fashion. Pyetle did sense an aura about him, but it was unnaturalness, not greatness. Each time he looked upon the near-corpse of a man he was filled with a strange sense of discordance. When he finally mustered the courage to place it, he found that he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure if the man were a man at all;  his features seemed feminine, and his frame was lithe and skinny, and the cloth which wrapped his groin seemed wrapped so tight that it couldn\u8217\'92t possibly contain any private parts. If he wasn\u8217\'92t a woman, he must have been a young castrato - older than boy, but young. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was also the fact that he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t seem to have any hair. There was no scruff on his chest, and he wasn\u8217\'92t just bald, he had no eyebrows. Though it was too dark to really tell, he seemed to be missing even his eyelashes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All in all, it disgusted Pyetle. So great was his revulsion that he shuddered and tucked in his feet when the young man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body suddenly curled up in a violent coughing fit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Blood and spittle flew, and when it was over, the poor wretch wiped his lips with the pitiful stump of his arm. Pyetle expected him to whimper or sob after such a brutal wracking, but the lad simply lay his head back down against the rock and sighed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He was awake.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The hairs on Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arms and legs pricked up when he noticed that the young man\u8217\'92s eyes were open, glinting in the darkness. They were searching him over, studying him. Pyetle returned a weak smile, but felt foolish when he realized that he was sitting in the shadow and the young man probably couldn\u8217\'92t see it. They were just sitting there, the two of them, staring at each other in an uneasy bond of silence.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle felt he should say something, but the young man spoke first.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you one of my jailers?\u8221\'94 he asked. His voice was quite soft and clear, nearly a woman\u8217\'92s voice. It put Pyetle off a little to hear such pleasant tones coming from someone in  such a wretched state, and so he took an odd beat to respond.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m Pyetle. I\u8217\'92m not in control here if that's what you want to know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, Pyetle, my name is Mazyd.\u8221\'94 The young man closed his eyes and sighed again, wincing in pain as he tried to find a more comfortable position.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But Pyetle was eager for conversation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine day, Isn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd did not answer. Instead, he took a deep breath, sat upright, and [c]asked a question out of turn. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Pyetle mumbled as he searched for a good answer. \u8220\'93I guess you could say I\u8217\'92m a new recruit.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At that the Mazyd laughed, or rather, he tried to laugh but he fell into a cough - this time when the blood and spittle came out it stained Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s toes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pardon me. Sorry. I would cover my mouth with my hands but -\u8221\'94 and he held his arms,\u8220\'93 I was recently robbed of them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well... I, uh\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s all good,\u8221\'94 Mazyd said with a chuckle. \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t blame you for falling in with these demons. We all do what we must. But why are you in here with me, if you\u8217\'92re one of them?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was told that they don\u8217\'92t trust me just yet. Don\u8217\'92t want me slinking around their hideaway.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They don\u8217\'92t trust you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve only just joined.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you trust them?\u8221\'94 Mazyd asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No\u8230\'85 Well... I suppose I do a little\u8230\'85 Actually no, I don\u8217\'92t at all. I was just thinking that, you know, I must be trusting them a little to let them whisk me away and throw me in here, but then again, I don\u8217\'92t really care if I live or die, I don\u8217\'92t care what happens to me, so it\u8217\'92s not really a matter of trust.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Again the young man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes flashed over Pyetle, who cut nearly as pitiful a figure there in the damp dark. Pyetle was small, skinny and balding. Every part of him was disheveled. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t care if you die?\u8221\'94 the young man asked. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not really, no.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Pyetle paused to consider his lot. \u8220\'93Im old. Old enough. I\u8217\'92ve lost too much. Too much loss, too late in life. Mix in some betrayal.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I just don\u8217\'92t have the energy or will to start up again. There\u8217\'92s just not enough time left for me, so even if I wanted to go back to the grind and work my life back up, there wouldn\u8217\'92t be any time left to just enjoy it all. So, it\u8217\'92s just a good time to give up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yet you took up with thieves?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This wasn\u8217\'92t planned. I\u8217\'92m only here because of a strange coincidence.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no such thing as coincidence,\u8221\'94 Mazyd said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle nodded in mock acceptance. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, yes,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Everything happens through the will of the Gods.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not what I mean.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just because you can\u8217\'92t see the chain of consequence that leads to your misery, that doesn\u8217\'92t mean that there isn\u8217\'92t one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well it\u8217\'92s good that you feel that way.\u8221\'94 Pyetle said. He was a little stunned that Mazyd could be so sure of himself, considering his state. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s really good,\u8221\'94 he repeated. \u8220\'93Impressive, really. If I were in you I\u8217\'92d be cursing everything. Fate especially. \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, this is my fault,\u8221\'94 Mayzd said. \u8220\'93At least, I don\u8217\'92t think it defies imagination to say that somewhere along the way I made a few mistakes.\u8221\'94 Mazyd said this with a great deal of levity, and it surprised Pyetle to see the glint of Mazyd\u8217\'92s white teeth. The bloody pulp of a man was actually smiling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I suppose you\u8217\'92re right,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said, smiling in turn. \u8220\'93But it doesn\u8217\'92t matter. Let\u8217\'92s just say that I happened upon the most striking person I\u8217\'92ve ever met at a pivotal crossroad in my life. That\u8217\'92s why I\u8217\'92m here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who was this person?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The leader of this robber band. His name is Ayram. You can\u8217\'92t have missed him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The young man shook his head and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve only heard voices.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, when you meet him you\u8217\'92ll know who he is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd grunted in a show of indifference and slumped down against the rock. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you owe this man a debt?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle sat back and considered Mazyd\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s question, as he hadn\u8217\'92t thought of it. Did he owe Aryam a debt? Ayram had saved him from Death, but that in itself didn\u8217\'92t bother him. Sure, it would have been cruel to die at Salavan\u8217\'92s hands, so he supposed he could thank Ayram for that - but a debt? Ayram was going to kill Salavan anyways. The whole thing was just a coincidence.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t spend too long thinking about it, because even if there was an honor debt to be paid, he no longer cared about honor. That was a game for people with something to lose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, he\u8217\'92s just an interesting person,\u8221\'94 Pyetle finally said. \u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s immense. It\u8217\'92s not just his size, it\u8217\'92s his presence. It\u8217\'92s exciting just to be around him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So you decided to float along in his wake?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Something like that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Mazyd said, straightening his back to sit upright, so that he might treat with Pyetle more personably ,\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s nice to meet you, Pyetle.\u8221\'94 He stuck out his arm for a handshake, then looked down at his bloody stump, and laughed. Pyetle laughed along with him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How about an elbow?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked, and he stuck his out. Mazyd bumped it with his own, and smiled again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It seems like neither of us have any friends here,\u8221\'94 Mazyd said, \u8220\'93and I\u8217\'92m in a pretty bad way. Pyetle, I need a friend right now, and you\u8217\'92re it. You don\u8217\'92t have a choice. I don\u8217\'92t care if you\u8217\'92re not interested, do what you want. I\u8217\'92m a little desperate. I just need the glimmer of hope that a friend can give - even if it's a one-way deal.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, no, no,\u8221\'94 Mazyd interrupted. \u8220\'93 You just do whatever you want. Just know that from this point on, whatever trust you put in me, I\u8217\'92ll treasure it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         Pyetle shrugged his shoulders.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You do what you want,\u8221\'94 Mazyd repeated. \u8220\'93My life isn\u8217\'92t worth much at the moment. They\u8217\'92ll probably kill me before tomorrow. I just don\u8217\'92t want to die without a friend nearby.\u8221\'94  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sure how to handle this doomed man\u8217\'92s wish. If Pyetle were younger, he would have humored Mazyd out of pity, but time had squeezed the empathy out of him. Plus, he didn\u8217\'92t know why Mazyd was locked up, nor why Ayram had elected to chop off his hands. It could have been simple theft, but it could be something unforgivable - Mazyd could be the kind of person to set his hands on another man\u8217\'92s wife. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you in here?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd sighed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was marching along with my people towards Jeket when your people ambushed us in the Junei hills.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What were you doing out there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s question gave Mazyd pause. He began to scrutinize his new friend. \u8220\'93We were about the Emperor\u8217\'92s business,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That surprises you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, yes. I figured you to be a thief.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, what, you\u8217\'92re a soldier?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93More or less.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why did they cut off your hands?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because I\u8217\'92m a magus.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Really?\u8221\'94 Pyetle said, his voice pitching in excitement. \u8220\'93Could you show me a little something?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         Mazyd just held up his bandaged arms to remind Pyetle of his predicament.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Right,\u8221\'94 said Pyetle, disappointed as much as the absence of proof for Mazyd\u8217\'92s story. \u8220\'93Well Mazyd, you\u8217\'92re either a fantastic thief and liar, or you\u8217\'92ve got the worst lot of any person  I\u8217\'92ve ever met - well anyone that\u8217\'92s lived past twenty. How old are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One hundred and twenty two.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One hundred and -\u8221\'94 But before Mayzd could repeat the number, he was interrupted by the echoes of feet slapping on the damp stone outside. Then keys scratched at the lock, and the door creaked open. Torchlight flooded into the cell, giving Pyetle a clean view of Mazyd. The shock of him was nearly blinding. He wasn\u8217\'92t just covered in blood. His body from his feet up to his neck were covered in intricate arrangement of symbols tattooed in black. It was the unmistakable markings of a Mazydei. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw fell open.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oi, Sandie! He\u8217\'92s awake!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, bring him out then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One of the two captors stepped into the cell. He was a scruffy looking man with a long nose. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can you stand up?\u8221\'94 he asked Mazyd. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d help but I don\u8217\'92t want to touch you, mate.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The woman behind him chuckled.  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, help him up Deedee. You twit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll do no such thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd looked to Pyetle, but Pytle was still stunned by the sight of him, so  he put his feet under his butt and labored up to a standing position by using the wall behind him for support.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about you?\u8221\'94 Deedee asked. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re alright, right? Name\u8217\'92s Pyetle, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hearing his name spoken aloud snapped Pyetle to attention. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, that is my name,\u8221\'94 he said. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re off to a bit of a meeting. You\u8217\'92re invited.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle stood up and stretched his back, all the while gawking at Mazyd. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d never dreamed he\u8217\'92d see a Mazydei this up close, or in this place of all places. He followed Mazyd and Deedee out of the cell and into the cave proper, where Sandie waited. She was holding the only torch, and it\u8217\'92s flickering light illuminated the narrow slip of rock under her feet. The rest of the ground fell into a large blue-green pool of mineral water. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle wondered what part of the continent\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s drainage system this could possibly be. He had never heard of such a cave in this part of the world. It\u8217\'92s walls were waxy and seemed to be frozen mid-melt. Glistening strands of hard seemed to drip from the ceiling like saliva on the roof of a lizard\u8217\'92s mouth. The water was alive. Shapes moved and little lights flashed in its depths. Deedee swept Pyetle along before he had time to worry.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They moved on into a tunnel that led up towards the surface. With each step the rock became dryer, and the going got steeper. Mazyd struggled along. He walked with his elbows tucked tight against his body, fearing to brush his arms against a stray shadow of a rock. It compromised his balance, and coupled with the recent loss of blood, he was sure to move slowly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The others accomodated him. Mazyd cut such a tragic figure that, even though Deedee and Sandie despised him in principle, they couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t help but pity him. They weren\u8217\'92t cruel people, but this little march felt cruel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Here and there they would pass a tunnels that spread off in odd directions, up and down, skewing this way that, leading off into some unknown abyss.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What created this place?\u8221\'94 Pyetle wondered aloud.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hell if I know,\u8221\'94 Deedee said. \u8220\'93Ayram might.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ayram knows,\u8221\'94 Sandie corrected, but she didn\u8217\'92t expound upon it. Pyetle didn\u8217\'92t feel like he was in any position to ask to do so.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Eventually, they came out into a massive open-air pit cave. Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes took time to adjust, for the circle of sky above was bright and blue, and the sun\u8217\'92s light angled down the colossal sandstone walls and fell upon the sand in a dusty, radiant glow. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Twenty-five of Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s band were in attendance. They were a motley crew of every race and color, and they congregated on the shadowed side of the pit across from where Pyetle stood. This wasn\u8217\'92t a living space, and so there weren\u8217\'92t many furnishings - just a few logs and makeshift chairs to sit on, as well as a few crude tents set up on the sunny-side of the pit. There wasn\u8217\'92t anything that couldn\u8217\'92t be packed away at a moment's notice. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle spied a few others high up on the rim. They were supposed to be lookouts, but they were eager to be down with the others, eager to be part of the buzz of excitement that filled the pit. This excitement was contagious. It worked its way into Pyetle when he, Mazyd, Deedee and Sandie made their way out into the sunlight. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All chatter ceased and all eyes turned to them. None seemed to care much for Pyetle, as Mazyd\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pale and bloody pulp captivated the crowd.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One of their number stood up, and like the shadow of a tree he towered over the others. He let loose a shrill whistle for attention. Everyone else promptly sat down. The giant then began walke to Pyetle and his company, out of the shadow and into the light, and Pyetle saw that it was Ayram. Who else.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Pyetle looked at Mazyd who stood transfixed in Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gaze. He wondered.Then there came a tugging at Pyetle\u8217\'92s shirt. It was Deedee.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He was beckoning Pyetle to follow and whispered, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come on!\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle trailed him around the edge of the pit to join the others in the pit\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow. Ayram began to speak just as he sat down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Before we decide what to do with this prisoner -\u8221\'94 Ayram slapped Mazyd on the back. The action nearly buckled Mazyd\u8217\'92s knees. He looked like a child next to Ayram. Everyone does. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Before we decide what to do about him, we need to address Papi and Colm. It\u8217\'92s come to my attention that some of you are blaming Elrahet for their deaths.\u8221\'94 Ayram had his arm extended out, and his piercing blue eyes were scanning the crowd, as if to accuse them all, even the ones who dared listened to the gossip. \u8220\'93That stops now.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He let the finality of his words echo around the pit. Whatever ill-will his people bore towards his witch, it was now gone.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In case you aren\u8217\'92t aware,\u8221\'94 he continued, \u8220\'93this man here is a Mazydei!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He shoved Mazyd forward and down to the ground. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A chorus of whispered mutterings broke out in the crowd. Not all had descended from the Empire or the Solean religion, but they had all by now heard the rumors about their prisoner, and this startling confirmation settled on them like a wet blanket. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle was especially moved to see a Mazydei brought so low.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93For those of you who don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 Ayram said, \u8220\'93this slight excuse for a man is one of the Empire\u8217\'92s most lauded generals and one of its most coveted weapons. He could have killed us all in heartbeat if Elrahet\u8217\'92s storm hadn\u8217\'92t raged.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Elrahet!\u8221\'94 cheered one of the crowd, and the rest clapped in approval.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should also thank Pella for her quick decision to take this scoundrel\u8217\'92s hands.\u8221\'94 Even as Ayram said it, the cheers and plaudits grew loud for Pella. Pyetle followed Deedee\u8217\'92s gaze and saw an old woman soaking it. She was smiling and waving as if all the others were her children.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Many more than just Papi and Colm would have died if it weren\u8217\'92t for that bolt of fire from the sky,\u8221\'94 Ayram declared. \u8220\'93If my command is not enough, and any of you still have something to settle about Papi and Colm, then it's me you need to see. There\u8217\'92s no room in this life for bitch talk and rabble rousers. You have a problem, come see me.\u8221\'94 He slapped his great chest with his fist, daring them to actually do it. \u8220\'93 I\u8217\'92ll be fair for as long as you are honest.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now,\u8221\'94 he said, turning to the crumpled form of Mazyd.  He reached down with one hand, grabbed him by the neck, and pulled him up to his feet. \u8220\'93What are you doing in my desert?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd stood there, his face drawn tight in pain, and did not answer. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Speak, man!\u8221\'94 Ayram shouted. \u8220\'93Is the Empire so scared of my family that they\u8217\'92d send you to root us out?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd looked up at Ayram and said in the most matter of fact tone imaginable, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t even know who you are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         Ayram grinned beneath his beard and a wild look came into his eyes. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know, I can tell when someone is lying.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All I know is that your name is Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And your what is your name, sir?\u8221\'94 Ayram asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mazyd Uro.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pella! Is this the one who burned your family alive?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pella shouted her answer. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No! I\u8217\'92ve not heard that name.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mazyd Uro\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Ayram repeated. \u8220\'93You were sent to hunt us, yes? A devious Imperial trap, no?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you not stopped to consider,\u8221\'94 Mazyd said with frustration, \u8220\'93That you were the trap for me?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Aye, but I don\u8217\'92t think anyone would reasonably expect that such a small band of simple thieves could overcome a Mazydei mage. No one would send a wolf like you into a den of foxes and expect it to lose. Hah!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yet here I am.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Here you are indeed. But why? This won\u8217\'92t be over until I get an answer. I can get Elrahet involved if you like. A little blood magic will tease it out of you. You\u8217\'92ve got enough of it left, no?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd looked out at the faces of the crowd. He found Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s and smiled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was looking for your hovel in the mountains,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We have no such place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Jandrian tribes. The place they\u8217\'92ve all fled to. It's some ruin in the mountains.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Urgiz?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, that\u8217\'92s what they call it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And what do you care about that forsaken place?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 For the first time, Mayzed took Ayram eye to eye, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was tasked to deliver a sword to your king.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A stillness swept over the crowd. One of them stood and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He lies!"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Another stood and tried to shout him down. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A Mazydei does not lie!\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd looked out at Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s followers to let them judge for themselves the earnest truth written on his face. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The light of the law is coming to you and your kin!\u8221\'94 he shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You mean the light of War!\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Barbarians make war,\u8221\'94 Mazyd spat. \u8220\'93The Empire makes peace!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His words set the band of outlaws buzzing. Pyetle was pushed into the sand as others rushed over him, each shouting \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Murderer!\u8221\'94, and \u8220\'93Demon!\u8221\'94. Deedee was enraptured. He stood next to Pyetle\u8217\'92s and shouted, \u8220\'93Genocidal Demon!\u8221\'94 so many times and with so much gusto that he nearly fainted. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram himself was unmoved. He held out his hand, but when that didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t work he let loose another shrill whistle. The outlaws settled back down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We did find a sword,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. \u8220\'93We found seventy-seven of them!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At that there was a great cheer. Mazyd rolled his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But yes, we did find an unusual one, too. Pella, bring it here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Old Pella got up, walked to Ayram, and pulled from her bundle of robes a wooden sword. It was immaculately carved and polished to a sheen. The base of its blade and its guard was inlaid with gold, and its half-shell pommel was trimmed with jade stars. Burned into its comically dull edge were words in old Carcinain. They read, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This blade will do as well as any other.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The message was clear: when the Empire comes knocking, you might as well defend yourself with a stick.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         The sight of the sword quieted what was left of the grumbling crowd. A few wept. They were outlaws and they killed, but what the Empire had done to them and their kind was another thing entirely. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0         \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This man thought he could stroll right into Urgiz and present this sword to Lindrimuud. He was so sure of his power that he thought he could stroll right out again! Look at him now. Well, I shall not be the one to stand in your way, Mazyd Uro. This sword belongs to Lindrimuud, and since the Emporer sent you to give it to him, then damn it, you\u8217\'92ll give it to him. But -\u8221\'94 he brought his face close to Mazyd\u8217\'92s, \u8220\'93- you\u8217\'92ll not be walking out like you planned.\u8221\'94}
