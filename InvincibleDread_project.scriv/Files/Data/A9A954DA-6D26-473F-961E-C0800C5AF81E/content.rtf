In reading records from times when medical and psychological science did not exist or were quite undeveloped, it is clear that grave mistakes were made. A victim of disseminated sclerosis, for example, was taken to be possessed because of his spastic jerkings and slidings and the shocking agony in spinal column and joints. Until quite recently, the victim of Tourette\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s syndrome was the perfect target for the accusation of \u8220\'93Possessed!\u8221\'94: torrents of profanities and obscenities, grunts, barks, curses, yelps, snorts, sniffs, tics, foot stomping, facial contortions all appear suddenly and just as suddenly cease in the subject. Nowadays, Tourette\u8217\'92s syndrome responds to drug treatment, and it seems to be a neurological disease involving a chemical abnormality in the brain. Many people suffering from illnesses and diseases well known to us today such as paranoia, Huntington\u8217\'92s chorea, dyslexia, Parkinson\u8217\'92s disease, or even mere skin diseases (psoriasis, herpes I, for instance), were treated as people \u8220\'93possessed\u8221\'94 or at least as \u8220\'93touched\u8221\'94 by the Devil.}
\par\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\line }{\f0\fs24\b0 These are only some of the dangers and traps that face every exorcist. His pain is physical, emotional, mental. He has to deal with what is eerie but not enthralling; with something askew, but intelligently so; with a quality that is upside down and inside out, but significantly so. The mordant traits of nightmare are there in full regalia, but this is no dream and permits him no thankful remission.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 In the first case,\~Zio\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s Friend and the Smiler, the insistence is that there is no essential difference between good and evil, and ultimately no difference between being and nonbeing; that all values are subject only to one\u8217\'92s personal preferences.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 In\~Father Bones and Mister Natch, the compelling idea that was seized by Evil Spirit seemed to be that all mysteries can and are resolved in \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93natural\u8221\'94 (i.e., rational or scientific or quantifiable) explanations; that there can be no relevance for the modern person in\~}{\f0\fs24\b0 a}{\f0\fs24\b0 nything that cannot be rationally understood; and that there can be no truth important to man beyond what is rational.}

It has wings because it flies.\u8221\'94 We will ignore that mysterious truth in its applications to our sexuality and our gender only at our great peril, I believe.}

For it seems that there is an individualism, a purely personalistic interpretation of human life abroad today, which exceeds by far the bounds of what used to be known as selfishness and egotism. It has produced in thousands of people an aberrant and idiosyncratic behavior which is truly destructive.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0 In\~The Rooster and the Tortoise, the fatal confusion (and in this case it was literally almost fatal) was between spirit and psyche; between those parts and attributes of ours that are quantifiable, and yet through which spirit most easily makes itself known. If everything we have taken to be of spirit can be made to seem a product merely of the human psyche, with no meaning or significance beyond its factualness, then love can be made to seem only a chemical interraction, and love\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s paradigm is killed.}

There was nothing abnormal in this. Up to a certain level, Marianne had an emotional reaction rather normal in the adolescent. But she pursued it with a logic that was not normal for her years. And she was deliberately isolated: she did not communicate with her companions, nor did she discuss it with her parents. She was determined to work it out for herself.}

Out of reach of the endless rhythm of responses, of recordings on her memory, of the fast-paced hip chatter of her companions, of blaring monologues by individuals. She became slowly more sensitive and expectant that she would find the self she sought, wrapped in semitransparent shadows. It was independent, she believed, of that distracting outer world, and of her inner psychic theater which was always at the mercy of that outer world and was so easily shattered by it. The restlessness of details had no place with the self. She came to believe that, if she could prevent the \u8220\'93bad flow\u8221\'94 of others entering, she could achieve \u8220\'93perfection of personhood.\u8221\'94}

The source, she thought, was the self in each one. She said: \u8220\'93The self has a means of communication which does not need images or thoughts or logic or any particle of matter.\u8221\'94 Psychologists and physiologists, she knew, identified the self with brain circuitry and synaptic joints and the mechanisms of sensation. This was like saying that the violin was the source of the violinist\u8217\'92s music.

And both psychologists and religionists insisted you make choices. And so, in most people, that source and its \u8220\'93flow\u8221\'94 were split into a kind of \u8220\'93black-and-white\u8221\'94 condition. Most people were always choosing, responding, being responsible for their actions, saying yes or no, and thereby \u8220\'93fissioning the self\u8217\'92s lively unity.\u8221\'94}
