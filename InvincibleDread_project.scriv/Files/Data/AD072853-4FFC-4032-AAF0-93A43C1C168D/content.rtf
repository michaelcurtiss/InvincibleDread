\par\pard\plain \tx0\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Every budding theologian looks for things that separates their religion from this rest. Ultimately, its a search for credibility. It feels like a proof to be able to say, 'every other religion believes the world believes }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 that}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 , and we're the only one that believes }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 this}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 .' }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Solitants revel in this kind of reasoning. When they proselytize to unbelievers, they open with the fact that every single one of Jandri's religions begin with a story that explains the existence of suffering. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The Supine Cult believes that there are just two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The Havainu take on more personal responsibility, as they believe that suffering is a result of sins committed, whether it be one\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s own sins or one\u8217\'92s ancestors.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The Shalkians believe that suffering is a symptom of Shalkhsahsar, which is a difficult concept to relate in so few words. It is often summarized as the inability to perceive the edgeless nature of reality.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 There are a hundred more religions, with a hundred variations each, all scattered about the continent. All of them, every single one, offers not just a explanation for suffering, but, more importantly, a solution for it. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Only the Solitants are unique. They don't offer a solution for suffering. They offer more of it. "Suffering", a Solitant priest will say with comforting smile, "is what this is all about!"}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 In the rare event a Solitant priest happens upon an eager ear, they will go on to argue that the notion of \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91Life without suffering\u8217\'92 is a mere trick of language. It's a string of words that has semantic sense but no bearing on reality.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 "Life }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  suffering", they say. "Try to suffer without suffering."}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 They laugh at the comic absurdity of it.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Then comes the version of this distilled for childlike audiences childlike distillate, like fruit juice from prunes.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 They say that the Divine Spark is like a block of sculptor's marble. It is clean, abstract, inert. Then comes the sculptor's chisel; then comes pain. As the chisel carves away at the marble to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the human. There is no beauty inside a stone without a chisel, and there is no beauty inside our fleshy vessels without pain. It is our travails that define us.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen hated Solitants. He hated suffering, so he hated Solitants. Solitiss was, in his eyes, the most toxic religion imaginable. At least the death cults that wandered the desert would do you a service and kill you before playing with your body. If a Solitant gets their hands on an adherent, well, Mandri had heard the stories. And besides, Mandri didn't find any of the their theology convincing. How it could be, for example, that a religion revolving around the concept of pain can have so few words for it? Solitants speak Common, their holy texts are written in Common, and in Common there's just the one word: pain.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 If a person says, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I am in pain,\u8221\'94 there\u8217\'92s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe? Did a loved one just die? Have their bowels been blocked for days, filling the innards up to bursting? Sure, the word \u8216\'91pain\u8217\'92 can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are using the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The word \u8216\'91anguish\u8217\'92 approaches something different, but that's not nearly enough. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Some intrepid philologists go as far as to suggest that the language Solitants use actually stunts the growth of pain appreciation. They argue that a person can\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t develop a sensitivity to the varieties of someone else's pain if there aren\u8217\'92t labels for them. A Solitant priest will argue that there is no real need to develop a robust lexicon of pain because the natural language of gesture is far, far superior. There\u8217\'92s no need for a fuzzy word when you can see it all written on the face clear as day.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Observe the eye and brow. Is there langour, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience, anxiety, havoc? Is the skin knit tight, is it smooth, is it beaded with sweat? Is the eye\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s lid puffy, or hollow, wet or dry, dark or pale, sallow of brown, or white, or purple? And then there\u8217\'92s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up to the face. The lower back knots up, then the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, and finally the lips draw tight to reveal a gnash of teeth. It doesn\u8217\'92t take an eye trained in physiognomical presentation to see all this and understand it, for pain is a primal thing. A person can look at another in pain and know, without knowing, their inner world.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 All that is required is to pay attention.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t agree with any of that. He thought that there would always be a need for a word that nails down a particular feeling. There was no better use-case than the present, where the pain in his leg was so severe that he was unable to walk. If he had the right word then maybe he could communicate to Moto how terrible it was. He couldn\u8217\'92t rely on his own tortured expressions because Moto wasn\u8217\'92t looking at his face. He couldn\u8217\'92t look at it. Mandri was slung across his shoulders. Moto wanted to meet up with the rest of the Ayramun, so he had picked Mandri up and off they went.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The journey was torture. With each step that Moto took, the wound in Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s thigh chafed against Moto\u8217\'92s arm, sending a fresh wave of pain out from that lizard-bite and into the hip. And it was not a short journey. Two hands had passed since they left the Bazul road and wandered straight out into the desert, chasing after the Ayramun\u8217\'92s tracks. At that point, Mandri could start to feel the venom working it\u8217\'92s way into his chest. He felt a tightness around his heart and lungs. It was getting harder and harder to breathe. There was a need, here, to let Moto know what was going on. A need for language. Mandri availed himself of all the usual figures of speech.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He tried, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Goddamnit that hurts!\u8221\'94, and \u8220\'93You fucking shit!\u8221\'94, and \u8220\'93Stop! For Sol\u8217\'92s sake, stop! It\u8217\'92s killing me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 None of these did the trick. Moto kept trotting along, unconcerned, eyes firmly set towards some }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Since Common lacked the word to adequately describe the nature of Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s pain, he was forced to make one up.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93EeeauuughhhGoddammotherOhhhshityousonofahurlingsow!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It really rolls off the tongue, so long as one screams it. It was enough, at least, to get Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s attention.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shut up,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93You did this to yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, no you don\u8217\'92t!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted. \u8220\'93This is your goddamn fault! You shit! You-uueeauughhhhh!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto bounced Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s weight upon his shoulders, sending another shock of pain through Mandri\u8217\'92s hip. Mandri retaliated by slamming his fist into Moto\u8217\'92s back.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto laughed it off and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I did warn you about the venom.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Fucking put me down!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Very well!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto leaned back and dropped Mandri like a child dropping a vegetable.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri let loose yet another curse as he landed on his wounded thigh. He then rolled around a little, wincing hard against the pain, trying to find some position that could give him some relief. He found the best thing was to lay all the way back and shift most of his weight to his right ass cheek. That elevated the leg enough to reduce the raging fire in his leg down to a throbbing flame. At the point, Mandri had recovered enough of his wits to realize that they hadn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t stopped to give him a break, they\u8217\'92d actually arrived at wherever it was they were headed.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The place was called Minting Rock. It was a big rock.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0  Outside the entrance of a cave. A lone outcrop of rock pit on the landscape. Entrance cant be seen behind a boulder.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The wound pulsing}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Two other ayramun just chilling.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 We meet again.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Shutup\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Agghhh, damn.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Keeps readjusting,}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 How you holding up there, Mandri?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 .}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Thought you\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d be taking off.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 That is a physical impossibility.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Just get up and go.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Theyve crushed my legs.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Reveals. Broken anles. Flop.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Doesnt that hurt?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Not if I dont want it to. One of the nice things about being a seilsi is that pain is optional.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Wish I could do that.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I might be able to help you out.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 How could you do that? Got a nice numbing drink hidden in your robes?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I might. Can you show me your leg?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri unwraps the wound.  Dark tendrils up the leg. Horrifying sight.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 MMMhmm.. Succup drag belly bite. Looks like its heading towards your heart. How\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s your chest feel?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri shares a knowing look.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ah shit.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Its alright, you happen to be in the one place you can be cured.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 You got something?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Not me. These ayramun. If they brought you back to life, surely they have the capacity to stop you from dying. Relieve your pain at the very least.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I don\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t know. They want shit from me. I just don\u8217\'92t like feeling, like, you know\u8230\'85It\u8217\'92s like, ulterior motives, man. Its something I hate. I can tell when they\u8217\'92re talking to me, there\u8217\'92s always some ulterior motive. Except for that Sob guy. He\u8217\'92s not exactly, you know\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I mean, there\u8217\'92s no reason for me to be out here other than these think I did something or know something and they\u8230\'85 aaaghh damn this hurts\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No, I understand. I feel the same way. I was created to be a tool. I would like for people to seek me out for who I am instead of what they can use me for. But people look at me, and that\u8217\'92s all they can see, a tool. A weapon. Rich and poor alike, I\u8217\'92m just a tool them.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Don\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t worry, Oba, you\u8217\'92ll always be a demon to me.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Can I offer you some advice? It\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s good advice. That\u8217\'92s one of my official functions, to dispense advice.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Well, I can\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t stop you.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Tell these Ayramun what they want to know. I get the sense that you harbor no real secret, and that you\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92re simply being stubborn out of spite, but considering your leg, the time for that is long gone.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 You think they\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92ll keep me alive even when they learn there\u8217\'92s no real use for me?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I do. These Ayramun, they\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92re good people.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Good people!? Look at what they\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92ve done to you! Look at me!}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I thought a lizard did that to you.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Only because that Moto mother fucker threw me in a lizard pit!}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ah. I guess I should say, they\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92re good people considering the baseline state of people. That might be hard to understand, but-}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Oh no, I get it.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 You have to remember, life out here is rough. I\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92ve met people out here that stretch the very definition of a person. They\u8217\'92d be chewing on your leg already.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I guess you\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92re right.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I always am.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Don\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t get carried away.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Like a human thing. A thing you know nothing about. A thing you need a Spark to understand.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I don\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t know. Love.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Love? I could give you advice on love. Many a princeling has sought out the services of the Mazydai in that respect. Unfortunately, we are obliged to give it to them.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Yeah right.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I can see your heart flutter at the thought of a girl.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pella}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 What would be your advice, then.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 First, its to stop eating what they give you.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 What, you think me of all people should lose weight?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 No, it\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s not about that. The cook, Moteah, she puts saltpeter in everything she makes.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 I don\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t follow.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Saltpeter quells the urge. Dulls the libido. Gives you sad uglies.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 You didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t happen to learn anything about our captors.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Did you?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 No haven\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t heard anything.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Sob comes from around the other side.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto! What fucking took you so long.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Where\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s ayram.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Seeing them, Mandri summoned the courage to stifle his moans. It was now a sharp inhale through clenched teeth was a more manly way to deal.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Looked at the wound.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Looked at moto.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What is this about?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s what it looks like. He got bit by drag-belly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93He jumped into a lizard pit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No I fucking didn\u8217\'92t!\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Then she turned back to Moto.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Why, pray sun, did this boy jump into a lizard pit?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93He threw a fit and jumped in. It\u8217\'92s like he\u8217\'92s got no will to live. He didn\u8217\'92t even try to fight the lizard off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Is that true, Chopper?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Chopper held up the lizard head, and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I chop it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri shouted, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s lying!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet knocked Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s leg with her cane, and that sent a fresh wave of pain up his hip and into his chest.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It was an ill omen finding you dead in the hills. I heard whispers of demons and Shis. I have no \u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pye, I\u8217\'92m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi, and there was no telling what he was capable of. There were rumors that Seilsi had strange biologies, but these rumors always conflicted, so Pyetle never gave them credence. One day a man would claim he saw a Seilsi jump over a crowd just because he could, while another would say he saw a Seilsi struggle to get up into a saddle. Some said they could see through walls, others said they were nearly blind.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 There was a lot unusual about Mazyd\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I could help with the Seilsi,\u8221\'94 Pyetle suggested.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I am worrying about myself. I\u8217\'92m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that\u8217\'92s something I could do.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah rolled her eyes. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll ask Pella about it.\u8221\'94 She turned back to the course and trudged along. \u8220\'93Come on, we almost there.\u8221\'94 }
