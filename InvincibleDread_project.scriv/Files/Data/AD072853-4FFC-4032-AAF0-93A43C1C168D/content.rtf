\par\pard\plain \tx0\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Every budding theologian looks for things that separates their religion from this rest. Ultimately, its a search for credibility. It feels like a proof to be able to say, 'every other religion believes the world believes }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 that}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 , and we're the only one that believes }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 this}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 .' }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Solitants revel in this kind of reasoning. When they proselytize to unbelievers, they open with the fact that every single one of Jandri's religions begin with a story that explains the existence of suffering. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The Supine Cult believes that there are just two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The Havainu take on more personal responsibility, as they believe that suffering is a result of sins committed, whether it be one\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s own sins or one\u8217\'92s ancestors.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The Shalkians believe that suffering is a symptom of Shalkhsahsar, which is a difficult concept to relate in so few words. It is often summarized as the inability to perceive the edgeless nature of reality.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 There are a hundred more religions, with a hundred variations each, all scattered about the continent. All of them, every single one, offers not just a explanation for suffering, but, more importantly, a solution for it. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Only the Solitants are unique. They don't offer a solution for suffering. They offer more of it. "Suffering", a Solitant priest will say with comforting smile, "is what this is all about!"}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 In the rare event a Solitant priest happens upon an eager ear, they will go on to argue that the notion of \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91Life without suffering\u8217\'92 is a mere trick of language. It's a string of words that has semantic sense but no bearing on reality.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 "Life }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  suffering", they say. "Try to suffer without suffering."}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 They laugh at the comic absurdity of it.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Then comes the version of this distilled for childlike audiences childlike distillate, like fruit juice from prunes.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 They say that the Divine Spark is like a block of sculptor's marble. It is clean, abstract, inert. Then comes the sculptor's chisel; then comes pain. As the chisel carves away at the marble to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the human. There is no beauty inside a stone without a chisel, and there is no beauty inside our fleshy vessels without pain. It is our travails that define us.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen hated Solitants. He hated suffering, so he hated Solitants. Solitiss was, in his eyes, the most toxic religion imaginable. At least the death cults that wandered the desert would do you a service and kill you before playing with your body. If a Solitant gets their hands on an adherent, well, Mandri had heard the stories. And besides, Mandri didn't find any of the their theology convincing. How it could be, for example, that a religion revolving around the concept of pain can have so few words for it? Solitants speak Common, their holy texts are written in Common, and in Common there's just the one word: pain.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 If a person says, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I am in pain,\u8221\'94 there\u8217\'92s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe? Did a loved one just die? Have their bowels been blocked for days, filling the innards up to bursting? Sure, the word \u8216\'91pain\u8217\'92 can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are using the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The word \u8216\'91anguish\u8217\'92 approaches something different, but that's not nearly enough. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Some intrepid philologists go as far as to suggest that the language Solitants use actually stunts the growth of pain appreciation. They argue that a person can\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t develop a sensitivity to the varieties of someone else's pain if there aren\u8217\'92t labels for them. A Solitant priest will argue that there is no real need to develop a robust lexicon of pain because the natural language of gesture is far, far superior. There\u8217\'92s no need for a fuzzy word when you can see it all written on the face clear as day.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Observe the eye and brow. Is there langour, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience, anxiety, havoc? Is the skin knit tight, is it smooth, is it beaded with sweat? Is the eye\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s lid puffy, or hollow, wet or dry, dark or pale, sallow of brown, or white, or purple? And then there\u8217\'92s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up to the face. The lower back knots up, then the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, and finally the lips draw tight to reveal a gnash of teeth. It doesn\u8217\'92t take an eye trained in physiognomical presentation to see all this and understand it, for pain is a primal thing. A person can look at another in pain and know, without knowing, their inner world.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 All that is required is to pay attention.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t agree with any of that. He thought that there would always be a need for a word that nails down a particular feeling. There was no better use-case than the present, where the pain in his leg was so severe that he was unable to walk. If he had the right word then maybe he could communicate to Moto how terrible it was. He couldn\u8217\'92t rely on his own tortured expressions because Moto wasn\u8217\'92t looking at his face. He couldn\u8217\'92t look at it. Mandri was slung across his shoulders. Moto wanted to meet up with the rest of the Ayramun, so he had picked Mandri up and off they went.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The journey was torture. With each step that Moto took, the wound in Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s thigh chafed against Moto\u8217\'92s arm, sending a fresh wave of pain out from that lizard-bite and into the hip. And it was not a short journey. Two hands had passed since they left the Bazul road and wandered straight out into the desert, chasing after the Ayramun\u8217\'92s tracks. At that point, Mandri could start to feel the venom working it\u8217\'92s way into his chest. He felt a tightness around his heart and lungs. It was getting harder and harder to breathe. There was a need, here, to let Moto know what was going on. A need for language. Mandri availed himself of all the usual figures of speech.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He tried, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Goddamnit that hurts!\u8221\'94, and \u8220\'93You fucking shit!\u8221\'94, and \u8220\'93Stop! For Sol\u8217\'92s sake, stop! It\u8217\'92s killing me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 None of these did the trick. Moto kept trotting along, unconcerned, eyes firmly set towards some }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Since Common lacked the word to adequately describe the nature of Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s pain, he was forced to make one up.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93EeeauuughhhGoddammotherOhhhshityousonofahurlingsow!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It really rolls off the tongue, so long as one screams it. It was enough to get Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s attention.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shut up,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93You did this to yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, no you don\u8217\'92t!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted. \u8220\'93This is your goddamn fault! You shit! You-uueeauughhhhh!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto bounced Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s weight upon his shoulders, sending another shock of pain through Mandri\u8217\'92s hip. Mandri retaliated by slamming his fist into Moto\u8217\'92s back.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto laughed it off and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I did warn you about the venom.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Put me down!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93As you wish!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto leaned back and dropped Mandri from a height like a camel dropping dung; wherever it falls, it falls.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Unfortunately for Mandri, he landed hard on his wounded thigh. He let loose another curse, then he rolled around a little, clenching his teeth against the pain, trying to find some twist of hip and spine that could give him some relief. The most comfortable position, he found, was to lay all the way back and shift most of his weight to his right ass cheek. That took the pressure off the bundle of nerves that were exploding in his left leg. It was enough, at least, to reduce the raging fire down to a throbbing flame.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 After a few more moments of hard wincing, Mandri recovered enough of his wits to realize that the reason Moto dropped him was because they\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d arrived at their destination: a place that Moto called Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was astonished by the sight of Minting Rock. It was exactly what the name suggested: a big rock. And it wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t just any big rock, it was a single, uncrumbled, uncracked, rock, like if he picked up a palm-sized rock off the ground and then scaled that up to the size of Salavan\u8217\'92s mansion, that\u8217\'92s what it was. Rocks that big tend to look like old, slumping things that have been half-melted by the sun, but this rock, this biggest of all boulders, it was a healthy, oblong rock. It wasn\u8217\'92t collapsing down into the sand, it balanced above it on its belly. So unnatural and precarious was its position, that Mandri felt like a strong, sand-blasting wind should be able to pick the whole up and send it tumbling along the desert floor. He felt like even he could move it, that if he stood next to it and gave a hearty push, he could get it rolling.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The contrast of that massive bulbous rock being set in an empty desert landscape with no other rocky eminence in sight, well that contrast made it seem like Minting Rock had been deliberately placed there by the hand of Solraheen. That would make it a holy site. But it wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t a holy site, it was called Minting Rock, and from the name Mandri could guess its true purpose: it was a place for these bandit Ayramun to mint counterfeit coins away from the prying eyes of the Hrkan royalty.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Of course, the Ayramun didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t mint the coins right out in the open. There was hole at the base of the rock that Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t quite see. He knew it was there because a few Ayramun were going in and out of it, squeezing one at a time through some obscured passage. Mandri supposed that most of the Ayramun were inside the rock, for nearby there was only Moto and two dour looking men just a few yards away.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Between Mandri and these men was a big pile of the Ayramun\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s stuff. Almost everything the Ayramun had been hauling was dumped there; their canvas strapped bags, their rolled up tarps, even that giant iron pot. Those two men were poking around the pile, and as Moto approached he drew their attention.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 One of them said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93There you are! We\u8217\'92ve been looking for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Really?\u8221\'94 Moto replied. \u8220\'93Seems to me like you\u8217\'92ve been tickling dick.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What do you mean? We were told to go and look for you, and here we are, looking right at you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto shook his head and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Whatever. I need to get Elrahet. The boy here got himself chewed up by a drag-belly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 All three men cast sidelong glances at Mandri. Mandri could feel the judgment in their grizzled faces. He thought he knew what they were thinking, they had that familiar air of men who think manliness is worth something. They looked at him and all the could see was soft hands, limp wrists, and weakness. Mandri looked at them, Moto especially, and all he could see was idiots.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The man who hadn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t yet spoke said, \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll take you to Elrahet, as we\u8217\'92ve been ordered to do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto grunted, then said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Lead on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The two men turned to head towards Minting Rock, but Moto hesitated. A peculiar lump of black cloth set amongst the pile of cast off things drew his eye.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He pointed to it and asked, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re just gonna leave this one out here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Without turning around, one of the men answered.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It ain\u8217\'92t going nowheres.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Whatever,\u8221\'94 Moto said, and then he set off to join them, leaving Mandri alone with the rest of the discarded burdens.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri watched them go with a little bit of hate in his eyes. He mumbled one last curse to chase after Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s inflated sense of self.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 When Mandri felt that the men were out of earshot, he turned his attention to that lump of cloth that had given Moto pause. Mandri could only see a sliver of it from where he lay. It seemed like a regular old black-stained cloth. It\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s weave was worn and its thinning threads were starting to separate, leaving gaps.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The strange thing about it was that it was loose. Everything else was folded, or tied up tight, or stuffed into as small a pocket as possible. These Ayramun were fastidious packers of provisions and gear, as any well-traveled sand-folk are, so a loose bit of cloth stood out like a sore thumb.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Since he couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t walk, Mandri crawled, and instead of crawling around the pile, he crawled up onto it because it looked comfortable. From this little perch he could see that the dark cloth in question was a robe, and it looked to be covering up something underneath, perhaps a long pillow, or a large sack of wine.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri dragged himself closer still to get a better look, careful not to disrupt the tenuous peace he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d negotiated between himself and the wound in his thigh. As soon as the pain started to flare up he slowed his crawl to a labored creep. When he chanced upon an especially comfortable place in the pile to stop, he did. With his elbow was sunk into a bag of grain, and his hip resting gently on an ox-bladder stuffed with jerk peels, he took a good long look at the object of interest.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 That\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s when noticed the hand.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It was sticking out from under the robe. It was a pale hand, and its pinky finger was dislocated and bent out at an odd angle. It was undeniably Mazyd Obo\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s hand, and it wasn\u8217\'92t moving or quivering in the slightest.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wondered if the rest of Obo was under that cloth. He suspected the answer was no, because the lump itself wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t big enough, nor protuberant enough, to match Mazyd Obo\u8217\'92s grotesque form.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri felt around the in pile for something to poke it with. In the absence of a stick or pole or anything like it, his searching fingers settled on an empty waterskin. He picked that up, made sure that it was well and truly empty, and then with a snap of his wrist he threw it at the mysterious lump.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The waterskin hit it, then fell harmlessly to the sand.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Nothing happened.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri dug around in the pile for something else to throw. He was so tickled by all the little trinkets his fingers were stumbling over, that he almost didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t hear the dull, snapping crack of bone. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It was the pale hand. Its pinky finger had popped itself back into its natural position.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri asked the lump, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Obo, is that you?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It did not answer, and it did not move.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri reached back down into the pile of things and pulled out a tight ball of twine.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He threw it at the lump.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Suddenly, the hand snapped to attention, and in one fluid motion, it snatched the twine out of the air and flung it right back at Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s face.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It smacked him right in the middle of his forehead.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri yelped and his spine stiffened up in fright. This sudden jerk of motion loosed the pain from his thigh and it shot up into his hip and lower back. That turned his startled yelp into an curling, anguished cry.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Through it all, Mandri kept his wide eyes fixed on that damnable hand. He watched, half in terror, half in curiosity as those pale fingers gathered up the robes and then pulled them up to expose what lay beneath.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It was, indeed, Mazyd Obo. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Obo, charmless Obo. The Mazyd was laying there face-up, with a wide, mischievous smile.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri frowned back.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Obo then pulled himself up into a sitting position, and that revealed why Mandri had thought he was a pillow - Obo was missing his legs. In their place were two bloody wrapped nubs. Obo was now just a torso, arms, and a pale, sallow head.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You look like shit,\u8221\'94 Obo said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What in Sol\u8217\'92s name happened to you?!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh these things?\u8221\'94 Obo said as he wiggled his stumps. \u8220\'93That Ayram fellow decided that my legs were more trouble than they were worth, so he cut them off.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw dropped.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you worry,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93I am no corpse yet.\u8221\'94 Obo then planted his palms in the dirt and lifted himself up, then hand-shimmied closer to pile so that he could lay against it. Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t take his eyes from Obo\u8217\'92s missing legs. Thin strands of gooey blood were swinging from them. He found himself wondering if he\u8217\'92d have to lose his own leg.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suspect I\u8217\'92ll be a corpse any time soon. Actually, I\u8217\'92m much better off than you are. You, my friend, are rushing up on corpsehood quite quickly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, I got bit by a drag-belly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The venom has a very distinctive smell.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was still looking at Obo\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s stumps. All complete and utter confusion.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t believe you\u8217\'92re not screaming in agony right now. Or passed out. I feel like passing out just looking at you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Obo nestled himself up against a , and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Nothing hurts if I don\u8217\'92t want it to. That\u8217\'92s a perk of being a Mazydai. Pain is optional.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s unfair.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No, that\u8217\'92s not what I mean. It\u8217\'92s my own damn leg. I tell you what, this pain, it\u8217\'92s worse than anything I\u8217\'92ve ever felt.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I might be able to help with that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve got a nice, stiff corn beer hidden in your robes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No, I\u8217\'92ve got something better. Show me your leg.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri did as told and started to undo the makeshift woolen bandage on his thigh, but Obo stopped him, saying, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Come down here first. I need to see it up close.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri paused to consider what it was that Obo might be planning to do to him. Despite Obo\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s calmness and generally pleasant demeanor, there was no getting past the fact that Obo looked like a creature who wriggled around in caves. It was the paleness and odd bone structure, but mostly it was his big bright eyes set in a mush of smooth, hairless skin. It was the absence of eyebrows, those signposts to the soul, that made the creature hard to trust. But the pain in Mandri\u8217\'92s leg was stupid. Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t think of many things worse than something stupid that just won\u8217\'92t go away, so he huffed and puffed and rolled himself down to where Obo sat.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Then he unwrapped the bandage, hissing through clenched teeth as he did. The blood had started to clot and so pulling on the wool bandage felt like he was ripping off flesh.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Once it was undone, the open air stung at the wound, and Mandri dry-heaved at the sight.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The edges of the bite marks were festering black, and the chewed up bits of flesh were leaking a brownish pus. Surrounding the wound, under his skin, dark tendrils spread out along the arterial pathways in either direction, down towards his knee and up into his hip.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh shit,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Relax,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93Lift your shirt.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not lifting my shirt!\u8221\'94 Mandri exclaimed. \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t want to see this shit!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How does your chest feel?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked into Obo\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes and they shared a knowing look.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Ah shit. God. I\u8217\'92m screwed, aren\u8217\'92t I.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I can do something for the pain.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Obo craned his neck and lifted his eyes to the heavens. Mandri thought he was about speak a prayer to Solraheen, for it was said that the Hrkan lords blessed the Mazydai with a special nearness to Sol . Instead, Obo hocked up a massive loogie and spit it onto Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s wound.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well, thanks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s the least I could do for a friend.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s as good a reason as any.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Obo looked down at his stumps and chuckled.}

To his credit, it does make a good deal of sense. And he took no pleasure in it. He is a measured fellow, very refreshing to see.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s like pain, Mandri. Why don\u8217\'92t you want to feel pain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Because it fucking hurts.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t want to feel pain because it\u8217\'92s annoying. It floods my mind with signal and prevents me from focusing on more important things. Anger is no different. It is unnecessary.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 This response stumped Mandri. He couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t decide if Obo\u8217\'92s rambling was a bit of pseudo-profoundity or actual wisdom. In such moments of indecision, Mandri resorted to his default state: calling bullshit.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the dumbest thing I\u8217\'92ve ever heard,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93And I tell you what, I\u8217\'92ll be angry for the both of us, because that\u8217\'92s just cruelty, what they\u8217\'92ve done to you.

If you\u8217\'92d been caught up by a Kalemite, they\u8217\'92d already be wearing your sacrum on their foreheads.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It is. This is torture. And I don\u8217\'92t just mean the leg\u8230\'85 it\u8217\'92s like I\u8217\'92m only here because they want things from me. It\u8217\'92s not a, you know, it\u8217\'92s not a reciprocal relationship. I just don\u8217\'92t like that feeling, like, there\u8217\'92s all these ulterior motives. That\u8217\'92s something I can\u8217\'92t stand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I get it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93A thing to know about me, now that we\u8217\'92re friends: I hate - and I use that word with all possible venom - I hate people who are only looking to get something out of me. And I\u8217\'92m specially attuned to that mindset. I can sense the scheming from a mile away, and these Ayramun are rank with it. When they talk to me, there\u8217\'92s always some ulterior motive. Except for that Sob guy. He\u8217\'92s not exactly all there, so he doesn\u8217\'92t really count.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know, Mandri, I think you\u8217\'92re being a little unfair. Out here in the Sand, you can\u8217\'92t expect much in the way of fraternization. It\u8217\'92s a challenge to survive, and so naturally these Ayramun will look at you and wonder how you can help solve their problems.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93But that\u8217\'92s how people always are. Survival has nothing to do with it. It\u8217\'92s the same when you get into the city. People in Jeket aren\u8217\'92t living hand-to-mouth, but they\u8217\'92re still, you know, always trying to make things better for themselves. If someone thinks you can help them out, they\u8217\'92ll want be your friend, otherwise, maybe you\u8217\'92re good for a laugh but that kind of thing always fizzles out. The only friendships that stay strong are the ones where people are getting something from it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I thought the point of friendship was to make life more enjoyable. No more, no less.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93See, that\u8217\'92s what people think. Then, as soon as someone starts to suffer, the other person leaves. Suffering isn\u8217\'92t an enjoyable thing to deal with. Sure, they might offer a comforting word, but then they leave.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It seems simpler to say that the person in question wasn\u8217\'92t really a friend to begin with, than to deny the whole concept of friendship altogether.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You say that, but I\u8217\'92ve never actually seen a true friend.

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Obo let the name hang in the air. Mandri stayed perfectly still, the model of composure. Now that he was aware of it, Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s could feel his pulse quicken and his cheeks flush. Then Obo hit him with a knowing smile.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri protested. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I haven\u8217\'92t put one thought towards that girl.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93If you say so.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s no matter, then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Of course it isn\u8217\'92t. Even if it was, I wouldn\u8217\'92t take advice from you on something like that. What kind of human would I be, taking advice from a sparkless Mazydai about love. I bet you can\u8217\'92t even feel love.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Not if I don\u8217\'92t want to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, yeah. Not if you don\u8217\'92t want to. And that\u8217\'92s exactly my point.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, there\u8217\'92s a very good reason why I\u8217\'92m urging you to stay away from Purl. You see, Purl has got -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 For the first time, Mandri was actually curious abut what Obo was going to say next, but Obo didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t finish his sentence because something off towards Minting Rock had caught his eye.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri followed Obo\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s gaze but saw nothing. Then Mazyd Obo lifted his finger to request silence. He followed it up by saying, \u8220\'93We will have to hold the discussion here... Things are about to happen.\u8221\'94\line \tab Then, without a word of clarification, Obo hand-shuffled himself back to the spot where he was laying before, and plopped himself right down. He then covered himself back up with his robe and fell flat on the sand, so that it looked like he\u8217\'92d never moved at all.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He gave Mandi one last whisper, muffled through his robe. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pretend that we never spoke.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri chuckled at Obo\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s odd behavior. He opened his mouth to ask what Obo meant by \u8216\'91things\u8217\'92, when he heard a curious birdsong spring out from Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 An Ayramun man was standing on top of Minting Rock. This man had his fingers in his mouth and was whistling a bright-beak\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s call.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 A second later, and Ayramun began to tumble out of the belly of Minting Rock. One, three, seven of them. As soon as one stumbled out, there came another, and each one in turn took off running towards Mandrameen. As they approached, Mandri saw their faces, and each man and woman were dead-set with serious purpose.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 They each ran right by him and picked up as much stuff as they could reasonably carry, then hauled it all back towards Minting Rock. Only one among them tarried, and that was Ayram himself. He stood right over Mandri and blocked the sun.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked up at Ayram, and such was the man\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s size that he actually felt humbled. Such a thing had never happened to Mandri before. No matter how big, or strong, or intelligent someone seemed, it could never erase the fact that they were only human, an impulsive, excitable, waffling human. Ayram, though, his dimensions exceeded the frame of reasonable expectation, so when Mandri, buried in his shadow, looked up, he saw the head, the arms, and the legs but his animal brain did not match the pattern as a person. Ayram was greater, he was solid, a reference point for being, like a father in the eyes of a child.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram noticed Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s wound, and then, in a register that rumbled the earth, shouted, \u8220\'93MOTO! Get over here!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was one of the Ayramun who\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d been scrambling around, trying to get all that stuff moved into Minting Rock. He was about halfway there, hugging a bulging sack of sand-dried meats when he heard Ayram shout his name. He immediately dropped the sack and then jogged on over to see what the fuss was about.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was happy to see that Moto\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s all-knowing smirk was absent. And there was a faint swipe-stain of blood from Mandri\u8217\'92s thigh on the shoulder of Moto\u8217\'92s formerly speckless garb. Mandri knew it wouldn\u8217\'92t wash out easily, and while it wasn\u8217\'92t justice, it did give Mandri a flutter of joy.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Explain,\u8221\'94 Ayram said to Moto as he pointed to Mandri\u8217\'92s leg.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s what it looks like,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93The boy got bit by drag-belly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93He was trying to run away and he jumped into a lizard pit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No I fucking didn\u8217\'92t!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s little outburst drew Ayram\u8217\'92s eye, and as Ayram Mandri found himself struck by a silly thought: this was the first time that Ayram had ever heard his voice. Ayram seemed to find it funny. He gave one amused grunt and that was enough to disarm Mandrameen completely.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Then Ayram set his imposing gaze back to Moto. He said,\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Explain why this boy was running away from you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto shrugged his shoulders shook his head as if perplexed. He had to get his body involved in the lie. That\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s the first rule one learns as a child - when faced with consequences, the whole body has got to get involved to sell the lie. But of course, all that gesticulating, it\u8217\'92s not }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 really }{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 selling the lie, it\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s letting everyone know that you\u8217\'92re going to cause a fuss if you get called out on the lie, and if people think that will be more trouble then the whole thing is worth, you might just get away with it. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I honestly have no idea. I must have said something, but I don\u8217\'92t know what, and then Mandri here threw a fit and ran off. I think the boy has got a dirty Spark. It\u8217\'92s like he\u8217\'92s not got the will to live. You should have seen it, the lizard was chewing on his leg and he didn\u8217\'92t even try to fight the thing off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 With each word that Moto spoke, Mandrameen\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s face scrunched up tighter and tighter. He made every effort short of squealing to let Ayram know what he really thought of Moto. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 If Ayram noticed, he didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t show it.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram said to Moto, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You didn\u8217\'92t do what I told you to do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How could I?\u8221\'94 Moto griped. \u8220\'93Ask him yourself, he won\u8217\'92t say a thing!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t have time for this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram then bent down and examined Mazyd Obo\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s robed lump. Ayram lifted the robe to reveal Obo\u8217\'92s face - he looked to be dead.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Take this one,\u8221\'94 Ayram commanded.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto bent down and grabbed Obo\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s limp arm, and pulled the rest of Obo up. He made a little show of taking care not make Obo\u8217\'92s wounded stumps worse off. A courtesy he\u8217\'92d denied Mandri. Once Obo was comfortably tucked under Moto\u8217\'92s arm, Moto took off.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0  Ayram turned to Mandri and said,\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re handling the pain well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not that bad.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s hard to believe. I\u8217\'92ve been bitten by a drag belly and it had me doubled over.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Must be a different kind of drag belly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Must be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri felt Ayram was trying to get the measure of him. Never more transparant had a man tried to get the measure of him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram asked, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Can you walk?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stood up, walked over to the disappearing pile of discarded things, grabbed the large iron pot by its rim, and lifted it up with ease. Then he brought it over, set it down next to Mandri, picked Mandri up by the scruff of his shirt, and then dropped him into the pot. The pot was so spacious that there was room enough in it for another whole Mandrameen.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Then, with nary a grunt of effort, Ayram carried that Mandri-stuffed pot all the way over to Minting Rock. When they came to entrance to cave, which turned out to be a narrow slit in the rock\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s base, Ayram set the pot down and then kicked it, spilling Mandrameen into the dirt.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It was an ill omen, finding you dead in the hills,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. \u8220\'93I hear whispers that you\u8217\'92re a demon from Shis. Considering everything that has happened, I\u8217\'92m inclined to believe it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t know what to say. Obo had suggested he tell the simple truth, but Mandri found himself cowering there in dirt before Ayram, and anything a cowering man says might be misconstrued as anxious deception. It wasn\u8217\'92t a question, anyways. He didn\u8217\'92t have to say anything. Best thing to do was just lay there and be quiet. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Then his mind was pricked by that other thing Obo said: make yourself useful.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri realized that it wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t a good look to not be able, in the most literal sense, to carry his own weight. So he decided, then, to get up and walk on his own. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri rolled onto his stomach and pushed himself up onto his good knee, and from there, he set his hands on the rock itself to hauled himself up to a standing position.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I think I can try to walk from here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram was looking down him with a unquivered eye.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93So it\u8217\'92s into the hole, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram reached down and grabbed Mandri\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s left arm. The width of Ayram\u8217\'92s hand matched the length of Mandri\u8217\'92s bicep, and his gigantic fingers encircled the arm a whole half over. With Mandri steadied, Ayram lead him into Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The entry hall of Minting Rock was a dark and narrow passage which, after a few steps, opened up into a short and fat tube. It was more than tall enough for Mandri, but Ayram had to duck. There was enough room to pass by the other Ayramun who were headed in the opposite direction, though when Ayram passed they gave him a respectful berth.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri marveled at how much time and effort it must have taken to carve out this little tube, however, this was for just for starters, because at the end tube, there wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t a passage leading down into a natural cave like Mandri expected, there was a curling flight of steps leading up. This meant that Minting Rock itself was a building, a hollowed bulk of sandstone . Mandri felt himself tremble with excitement of even being in such a place. It was every little boy\u8217\'92s dream of desert hideout come true.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri climbed the steps, climbed up into the meat of the rock, bumping some nameless Ayramun in the dark, and then he came into Minting Rock\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s central chamber. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 into two revoultions of a sMandri was suprised to see that, all along the ceiling and wall were long bore shafts that let light and air into the hall. The point sources of light then bounced the hall, creating a soft red glow that diffused the chisel-prick texture of the sandstone\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s surface. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The only bad thing about it was the smell. Such a confined space, with so many unwashed bandit folk, the odor was dank.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was trying to reason with the old witch Elrahet, who was trying to slap Mazyd Obo into consciousness.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That won\u8217\'92t work,\u8221\'94 Moto said.}
