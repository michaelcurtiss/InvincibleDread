But this simple dichotomy does not satisfy everyone. The desire for a deeper understanding is too strong, and so the world\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s religions are further grouped and divided based on similarities and differences of belief and behavior. When the common threads of identity are identified, and the heredity of belief is charted, one\u8217\'92s own religion usually remains in a category all it\u8217\'92s own, above the rest, because there is always that one big important thing that separates it from the pretenders. It certainly feels like a proof to be able to say, 'every other religion in the world believes this-certain-something, and we're the only one that believes something-other, and that\u8217\'92s why we are right.'}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Solitants come specially prepared for battle in this arena. When they proselytize to the fractured, they open with the observation that every single religion in existence begins with a story that explains the existence of suffering. The Supine Cult believes that there are two gods, one good, one bad, and all suffering comes from the latter. The Bavainu believe that suffering is a result of evil acts on the part of people, whether it be one\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s own actions or one\u8217\'92s ancestors. The Shell-kings believe that suffering is a symptom of Shellkhashar, which is a kind of spiritual disease which prevents a person from perceiving the edgeless nature of reality. There are a hundred more religions, with a hundred variations each, and in every instance, the story suffering\u8217\'92s arrival is accompanied by a solution for it. The Supine Cult say to lay down and pray your energy into the sky to make it stronger, for that is where the righteousness dwells. The Bavainu say to live rightly and follow their old commandments, passed down from Solraheen. The Shell-kings recommend drinking the blood of a willing virgin mixed with a toxin from a sea-water slug\u8217\'92s shell. Every religion has it\u8217\'92s own solution, every one of them is selling relief, every one except for Solitantism. "Suffering is not something to fear," a Solitant priest will say as he or she smiles underneath a mask of self-inflicted scars. "Suffering is what this is all about!"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In the rare event that a Solitant priest happens upon an eager ear, they will go on to argue that the notion of \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91Life without suffering\u8217\'92 is a string of words whose semantic sense stems from a rather profound category error. "Life }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  suffering", they say. "Try to suffer without suffering." They laugh at the absurdity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Divine Spark is like a block of sculptor's marble; clean, abstract, inert, featureless, and then comes the sculptor's chisel. As the chisel carves away at the marble to find the statue, so too does pain carve away at the Spark to find the person. What troubles our fleshy vessels is what makes us who we are. Solitants are so convinced of this that they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve invented an entire language dedicated to capturing and expressing the subtleties and variations of pain so that they could systematize the act of becoming a certain kind of person through the proper applications of pain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  They had to invent a language because typical Common has only the one word: pain. If a person says, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am in pain,\u8221\'94 there\u8217\'92s no way to know, precisely, what they mean. Did this person stub their toe, or did a loved one just die? Have their bowels been blocked for days? The word \u8216\'91pain\u8217\'92 can be accompanied by all manner of adjectives and intensifiers, but the fact remains that states of being which are not at all alike are using the same word. Even Old Jandri has separate monosyllables for physical, and then mental, pain. The words \u8216\'91anguish\u8217\'92, \u8216\'91ache\u8217\'92, \u8216\'91soreness\u8217\'92, \u8216\'91irritation\u8217\'92, and \u8216\'91misery\u8217\'92 all approach different things, but they\u8217\'92re not nearly enough. Intrepid Solitant linguists go as far as to claim that the very structure of the Common language actually stunts the growth of pain appreciation. They argue that a person can\u8217\'92t develop a sensitivity to the great varieties of pain if the mind divides the world into clear subject, verb, and object.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri disagreed. In his view, there was no need to develop a language of pain because the natural language of gesture is far, far superior. Of what use is a fuzzy word when you can see it all written on the face clear as day?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Observe the eye and brow. Is there langour, lethargy, an imploring look for help? Impatience, anxiety? Is the skin knit tight, is it smooth, is it beaded with sweat? Is the eye\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lid puffy or hollow? Are the cheeks wet or dry, dark or pale, sallowing brown, or purple, or yellow? Then there\u8217\'92s the body. All the little tremors of the body eventually work themselves up into the face. The lower back knots up, then the shoulders spasm, the neck curls, and finally the lips draw tight and the teeth gnash in havoc. A trained eye can look at another in pain and know, without words, the entirety of their inner world. The holy language of the Solitants was redundant, and no argument could convince Mandri otherwise. He knew what he knew, and that included what everyone else knew. He couldn\u8217\'92t be wrong. Unfortunately, he\u8217\'92d never been bitten by a demon before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The pain in his thigh was so severe that slightest pressure elicited a scream. The skin around the black and festering wound was taut and throbbing, a drumhead reverberating pain. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t walk, so Moto had to carry him slung across the top his pack, and with each step that Moto took, Mandri\u8217\'92s raw wound chafed against Moto\u8217\'92s shoulder, sending a fresh wave of excruciating pain into his groin and hip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If Mandri had the right word in the right language then he might have been able to communicate to Moto how terrible it was, and if Moto had the ear he might have listened. Instead,  Mandri availed himself of all the usual figures of speech.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He tried, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Stop, you dumb shit!\u8221\'94, and, \u8220\'93Goddamnit it hurts!\u8221\'94, and \u8220\'93For Sol\u8217\'92s sake, stop! It\u8217\'92s killing me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto kept trotting along, unconcerned save for a few annoyed grunts. Since Mandri lacked the word to adequately describe the nature of his pain, he was forced to make one up. After a particularly brutal fit, he stiffened up and screamed, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93EeeauuughhhGoddamnyousonofahurlingsow!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shut up,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93You did this to yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You shit! You-uueeauughhhhh!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You-uueeauughhhhh was no exaggeration. It was actually quite close to a word in the secret Solitant language, pronounced \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91yoogah\u8217\'92, and if Moto had had the ear for it he would have stopped and immediately administered the most tender care. Instead, he kept on walking while Mandri fainted from the torture.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri woke up several hands later to a clear night sky of starry black. Swirling around was chatter of concerned voices. He was still bouncing atop Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders, still marching through the Sand, and though his leg was numb he could feel the demon\u8217\'92s poison gnawing at his chest, constricting his heart and lungs. Every breath was a labor. Then he fainted again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t wake until the next day, when Moto leaned back and dropped Mandri from that height like a camel dropping dung. Unfortunately for Mandri, he landed hard on his wounded thigh. The shock jerked him alert and he let loose another gargled curse, then he rolled around a little, clenching his teeth against the pain, trying to find some twist of hip and spine that could give him relief. The most comfortable position, he found, was to lay all the way back and shift most of his weight to his right ass cheek. That took the pressure off the bundle of nerves that were exploding in his left leg. It was enough, at least, to give his reeling mind the space to understand he was still alive and that feeling had returned to his extremities. He could breathe somewhat freely. His affected thigh had been poulticed and bandaged but it was done poorly, as the ragged wraps were coming apart. After another few fingers of hard wincing, Mandri recovered enough of his wits to realize that the reason Moto dropped him was because they\u8217\'92d arrived at some accursed destination: an enormous black rock sitting in the middle of a barren land.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was astonished by the sight of it. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t just any big rock, it was a single, uncrumbled, uncracked, rock, like if he picked up a palm-sized rock off the ground and then scaled that up to the size of Salavan\u8217\'92s mansion, that\u8217\'92s what it was. Rocks that big in the Sand tend to look like old, slumping things that have been half-melted by the sun, but this rock, this biggest of all boulders, it was a healthy, oblong rock, it wasn\u8217\'92t collapsing down into the sand, it was balanced above it on its belly. So unnatural and precarious was its position, that Mandri supposed a strong, sand-blasting wind should be able to pick the whole the up and send it tumbling along the desert floor. He felt like even he could move it, that if he stood next to it and gave a hearty push, he could get it rolling.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sitting as it was in an empty desert landscape, with no other rocky eminence in sight, well, that made it seem like the rock had been deliberately placed there by the hand of Solraheen. Surely, it was a holy site.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Welcome to Minting Rock,\u8221\'94 said Moto, noting Mandri was awake. Then he unstrapped his pack, tossed it onto a big pile of the rest of the Ayramun\u8217\'92s haulings. Two other Ayramun, dour looking men, milled about the pile of canvas strapped bags, and as Moto walked passed them, one of them grumbled, \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ve been looking for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Really?\u8221\'94 Moto replied. \u8220\'93Seems to me like you\u8217\'92ve been standing here tickling dick.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We got told to look for you, and here we is, lookin at you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I fell behind because the boy there got himself chewed up by a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All three men cast sidelong glances at Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Watch him for me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How bout we take you to Ayram, as we been ordered to do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lead on, then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri watched them go, watched them squeeze into some unseen crevice at the base of the giant rock, and as Moto disappeared, Mandri felt a little bit of hate well up in his heart. He tried to remember the Old Jandri curse that could kill a dishonest man.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shis za garood ah,\u8221\'94 he whispered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Those weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the right words, but he hoped the strength of his ire made up for it. Then he set about preparing the ground around him so that he could more comfortably wallow in self-pity. He shimmied nearer the pile of packs and pulled one out so that he could lean against it, and as he did, something groaned. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The sound came from the other side of the pile. Since Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t walk, he crawled, and he crawled right up onto the pile of packs because a straight line is the shortest. It was a remarkably comfortable assortment of squishy bags, and once on top of this little hill he spied what had probably made the noise: a pile of the dark rags sitting in the sand a few feet away. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri dragged himself closer to get a better look at it, careful not to disrupt the tenuous peace he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d negotiated between himself and the wound in his thigh. As soon as the pain started to flare up he stopped moving altogether. He nestled his elbow into a bag of grain, and let his hip sink gently into an inside-out ox-bladder stuffed with jerky. With a contented sigh he settled in and studied that pile of black rags just below him. They were Mazyd Obo\u8217\'92s rags, and the lump they covered was the right size for a handless, legless, Mazyd.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri felt around underneath him for something to poke Obo with. His searching fingers settled on an empty waterskin. He picked it up and tried to drink from it, but it was well and truly empty. Disappointed, he tossed it at Obo, and the waterskin flapped harmlessly off the shrouded, lifeless lump, then dropped with a slap into the sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You there?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He waited, but no response came.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri dug around in the pile for something else to throw. He was so tickled by all the little trinkets that his fingers were stumbling over, a __, a ___, that he almost didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t register the dull, snapping crack of bone as Obo\u8217\'92s black rags twitched.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo, is that you?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Again there was no answer.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri reached back down into the pile of things and pulled out a tight ball of twine. He threw it hard at the lump, and it bounced harmlessly off it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A moment later another bone cracked and the lump of rags shuddered again, loosing a strap of robe to reveal a pale shoulder. Mandri watched, half in terror, half in curiosity as Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pale and hairless head emerged from the mass of tatters, smiling like a sun-bather as it did. Obo pushed himself up into a sitting position, and the rest of the tattered robes fell away to reveal a heavily bruised and beaten body. Mandri had seen some pitiful sights, but watching this Mazyd use his blood-nubbed forearms to shove his own broken ribs back into the place was something else.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When that was done, Obo twisted around to stretch his spine, and as he did a series of sharp bone-cracks sounded out. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s own spine stiffened up in sympathetic fright, and this sudden jerk sent a fresh wave of torture radiating out of his thigh. He managed to bear it without yelping, and was glad he did because it felt impolite to express any discomfort when Obo was much worse off. Really, there was no comparison as Obo had been reduced to a mere torso, and judging by the sorry state of his ragged robe, he hadn\u8217\'92t been carried through the desert like Mandri, he\u8217\'92d been dragged along it\u8217\'92s rugged floor as if he\u8217\'92d been condmened to being hung-drawn-and-quartered, only in the opposite order.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You look like shit,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you worry,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93I am no corpse yet.\u8221\'94 Obo scooted himself closer Mandri\u8217\'92s pile, biting down on his robes as he did for his mouth was the only way he could carry them. Obo leaned himself up against the mound of misgivings, and when he caught Mandri staring at his severed legs, he spat out his robe and covered up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should save that concern for yourself. You, my friend, are rushing up on corpsehood quite quickly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked down at his poorly poulticed leg and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think I made it through the worst of it. Last night I could hardly breathe, but now I can breathe just fine.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your wound has a very distinctive scent. What bit you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You won\u8217\'92t believe me. It was a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s what I said.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Interesting.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wait, you believe me?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you sure it wasn\u8217\'92t some unfamiliar species of lizard?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It looked nothing like a lizard. I\u8217\'92m telling you, it was a demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you sure it wasn\u8217\'92t a Mazyd?\u8221\'94 Obo asked jokingly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I only ask because the last time you saw a demon\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know, but this time was different. I saw what I saw.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sight is a remarkably unreliable instrument.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look I don\u8217\'92t care if you believe me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why did you ask?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sighed in irritation. Compound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t believe you\u8217\'92re not screaming in agony right now. Or passed out. I feel like passing out just looking at you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nothing hurts if I don\u8217\'92t want it to. That\u8217\'92s one of the perks of being me\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 pain is optional.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Unfair.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know\u8230\'85 I suspect that if I felt pain as you do, people would be less cruel to me. Maybe I would still have my legs.\u8221\'94 He wiggled his bloody stumps. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, well, I think I\u8217\'92d rather be you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you\u8217\'92re feeling bad, you should let me look at the wound.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I show you, you can fix the pain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I won\u8217\'92t know for sure unless I see it first.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, and he started to untie the makeshift woolen bandage on his thigh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo stopped him, saying, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come down here. I need to see it up close.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri paused to consider what it was that Obo might be planning to do to him. Despite Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s calm and generally amicable demeanor, there was no getting past the fact that Obo looked like a creature who wriggled around in caves. Obo\u8217\'92s stark paleness was upsetting, his chalk-white skin gleamed in the mid-morning sun. The absence of eyebrows, those signposts to the Spark, made it impossible to determine the intentions hidden inside Obo\u8217\'92s gleaming grey eyes. In the end, there was no reason not to let him have a look. The pain in Mandri\u8217\'92s leg was stupid, and Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t think of many things worse than something stupid that just won\u8217\'92t go away, so he huffed and puffed and rolled himself down to where Obo sat. Once he\u8217\'92d gotten himself as comfortable as he could be, he rolled up the hem of his robe, and that\u8217\'92s when fear struck him. Above his knee, the veins in his leg ran black as ink, and nearer to the tight brownwool wraps of the poultice, those veins were bulging out of his like nightworms.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol\u8217\'92s light,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He gingerly unwrapped the woolen scraps that held the poultice in place. The various leaves and lichens mixed into the poultice were moist and spongy, and he was able to flick most of it into his open palm easily enough, but the rest he had to pluck, for the pulped leaf stems closer to the flesh were caked in a gooey brown emulsion of blood, pus, and poultice paste.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do the best you can to remove it all,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri kept picking until all that was left was the utterly frightful sight of a day-old demon bite. The edges of this fang-scalloped wound were festering and necrotic, and this jagged black ring enclosed a puddle of that brown emulsion, which had, in parts, been brushed away to reveal the red-raw muscle of his thigh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The pain was extreme, but even so, it all looked much worse than it felt. What really got Mandri worried how his inky black veins spidered up his thigh and in towards his crotch.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh shit,\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Relax,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s see the extent of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. I don\u8217\'92t want to know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How does your chest feel?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just hurry up and do what you\u8217\'92re gonna do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo studied the wound with a look of genuine curiosity, as if he were an dealer appraising the authenticity of a paneled sculpture.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hurry up,\u8221\'94 said Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo pulled back and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t do anything for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wanted to see the wound. And I must say, that is the strangest bite wound I\u8217\'92ve ever seen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You lied?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do not lie. I may dissemble, but not lie.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You lied\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Mandri muttered as he did his best to rewrap the poultice onto his throbbing wound. \u8220\'93But I won\u8217\'92t hold your lie against you. You might just be the only person who is worse off than I am, so\u8230\'85 I guess you win some leeway.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I appreciate it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I like to save my spite for people who really, truly deserve it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And who is that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Most people, really. But for right now, its focused on Moto. The man is an ass. He is a donkey wearing human skin.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s healthy, I think, to refrain from holding grudges.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t tell me you wouldn\u8217\'92t try to get even with Ayram if you had the chance. I mean, look at what he did to you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, I wouldn\u8217\'92t. In his eyes, Ayram was right to do what he did. He is a somewhat measured fellow, very refreshing to see in the Sand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He chopped off your legs.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s in the past.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scoffed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see what you\u8217\'92re doing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What am I doing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You may be able to fool these outland jukes, but you can\u8217\'92t fool me. I can see you scheming.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We Mazydai are not capable of anger.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You won\u8217\'92t ever be able to walk again. That doesn\u8217\'92t make you a little upset?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t want to feel pain because it\u8217\'92s annoying. And besides, I don\u8217\'92t want to be influenced by anything that prevents me from focusing on more important things. Anger is no different from pain\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it\u8217\'92s useful in a flash, but any more completely redundant.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the dumbest thing I\u8217\'92ve ever heard,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93I tell you what, I\u8217\'92ll hate the Ayramun for the both of us. They deserve it for what they\u8217\'92ve done to you, what they\u8217\'92ve done to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought a demon did that to you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That creature never would have bit me if that ass Moto didn\u8217\'92t throw me into its pit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see. But I don\u8217\'92t think the rest of the Ayramun worth hating. They\u8217\'92re good people, if you take into account what passes for people in these parts. You have to remember that life out here is difficult. If you\u8217\'92d been caught up by a Kalemite, you\u8217\'92d have been eaten, and the one to consume your stomach would be wearing your sacrum on his forehead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Honestly, I would have preferred that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo laughs, disebelief.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not joking. I was dead, and I prefer that to being , waiting to find a use for me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I understand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A thing to know about me, now that we\u8217\'92re friends: I hate\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 and I use that word with all possible venom\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 I hate people who are only looking to get something from me. And I\u8217\'92m specially attuned to people who think that way. I can sense the scheming from a mile away, and these Ayramun are rank with it. When they talk, there\u8217\'92s always some ulterior motive\u8230\'85except for that Sob guy. He\u8217\'92s not exactly all there, so he doesn\u8217\'92t really count.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think you need to lower your expectations, Mandri. Look at where we are. It\u8217\'92s a challenge to survive out here, and so naturally these people are going to  will look at you and wonder how you can help solve their problems.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, the Sand has nothing to do with it. Survival has nothing to do with it, because it\u8217\'92s the same when you get into the city. People in Jeket aren\u8217\'92t living hand-to-mouth, but they\u8217\'92re still, you know, always trying to make things better for themselves. If someone thinks you can help them out, they\u8217\'92ll want be your friend, otherwise, maybe you\u8217\'92re good for a laugh but that kind of thing always fizzles out. The only friendships that stay strong are the ones where people are getting something from it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was under the impression that the purpose of friendship was to make life more enjoyable, no more, no less.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See, that\u8217\'92s what people think. Then, as soon as someone starts to suffer, the other person leaves. Suffering isn\u8217\'92t an enjoyable thing to deal with. Sure, they might offer a comforting word, but then they leave.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It seems simpler to say that the person in question wasn\u8217\'92t really a friend to begin with, than to deny the whole concept of friendship altogether.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You say that, but I\u8217\'92ve never actually seen a true friend. Someone who is actually willing to sacrifice something meaningful in a time of need. And I\u8217\'92m not just going on my own personal experiences here. I haven\u8217\'92t seen it. I hear stories, but I haven\u8217\'92t seen it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I can\u8217\'92t challenge your own experiences with my own, because, being what I am, I don\u8217\'92t have any.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you never will.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Only because I have none to share. We Mazydai were created to be tools. When people look at us, that\u8217\'92s what they see, a tool, a weapon. As such, I\u8217\'92ve never had a friend, much less a \u8216\'91true friend\u8217\'92 like you say. Yet even so, I am open to the possibility of them existing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, they don\u8217\'92t. Not unless there\u8217\'92s some mutually beneficial arrangement. And it\u8217\'92s for that reason that I can assure you, our budding friendship here is doomed. It\u8217\'92s doomed because there\u8217\'92s nothing I can give to you, and you sure as shit can\u8217\'92t give anything to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can give you advice. It is good advice.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Advice on what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Staying alive.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Advice isn\u8217\'92t going to cure this wound, Obo.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell these Ayramun what they want to know. If they ask a question, answer it as honestly as you can. It\u8217\'92s clear to me that you harbor no real secrets, so it is time to play along.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93As soon as I tell them what they want to know, they\u8217\'92ll just kill me. I\u8217\'92m no use to them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then you\u8217\'92ll have to make yourself useful. These folk, they aren\u8217\'92t in a position to refuse a helping hand, believe me. Take it from someone whose stated purpose for existing is to be useful. I know when there\u8217\'92s an opportunity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I guess that\u8217\'92s good advice.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And that\u8217\'92s not all the advice I\u8217\'92ve to give.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s hear it then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Stay away from Purl.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The girl. The one missing her hand. Her name is Purl. Stay away from her.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t have any intention of going near her.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t lie to me Mandri. I say her name and I can hear your pulse quicken.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri is like wut.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you talking about? I have no interest in her at all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo let the name hang in the air. Mandri stayed perfectly still, the model of composure. Now that he was aware of it, Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s could feel his pulse quicken and his cheeks flush. Then Obo hit him with a knowing smile.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri protested. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I haven\u8217\'92t put one thought towards that girl.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you say so.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do say so.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s no matter, then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course it isn\u8217\'92t. Even if it was, I wouldn\u8217\'92t take advice from you on something like that. What kind of human would I be, taking advice from a sparkless Mazydai about love. I bet you can\u8217\'92t even feel love.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not if I don\u8217\'92t want to.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, yeah. Not if you don\u8217\'92t want to. And that\u8217\'92s exactly my point.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, there\u8217\'92s a very good reason why I\u8217\'92m urging you to stay away from Purl. You see, Purl has got -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 For the first time, Mandri was actually curious abut what Obo was going to say next, but Obo didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t finish his sentence because something off towards Minting Rock had caught his eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri followed Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gaze but saw nothing. Then Mazyd Obo lifted his finger to request silence. He followed it up by saying, \u8220\'93We will have to hold the discussion here... Things are about to happen.\u8221\'94\line \tab Then, without a word of clarification, Obo hand-shuffled himself back to the spot where he was laying before, and plopped himself right down. He then covered himself back up with his robe and fell flat on the sand, so that it looked like he\u8217\'92d never moved at all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He gave Mandi one last whisper, muffled through his robe. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pretend that we never spoke.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri chuckled at Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s odd behavior. He opened his mouth to ask what Obo meant by \u8216\'91things\u8217\'92, when he heard a curious birdsong spring out from Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 An Ayramun man was standing on top of Minting Rock. This man had his fingers in his mouth and was whistling a bright-beak\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s call.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A second later, and Ayramun began to tumble out of the belly of Minting Rock. One, three, seven of them. As soon as one stumbled out, there came another, and each one in turn took off running towards Mandrameen. As they approached, Mandri saw their faces, and each man and woman were dead-set with serious purpose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They each ran right by him and picked up as much stuff as they could reasonably carry, then hauled it all back towards Minting Rock. Only one among them tarried, and that was Ayram himself. He stood right over Mandri and blocked the sun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked up at Ayram, and such was the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s size that he actually felt humbled. Such a thing had never happened to Mandri before. No matter how big, or strong, or intelligent someone seemed, it could never erase the fact that they were only human, an impulsive, excitable, waffling human. Ayram, though, his dimensions exceeded the frame of reasonable expectation, so when Mandri, buried in his shadow, looked up, he saw the head, the arms, and the legs but his animal brain did not match the pattern as a person. Ayram was greater, he was solid, a reference point for being, like a father in the eyes of a child.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram noticed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wound, and then, in a register that rumbled the earth, shouted, \u8220\'93MOTO! Get over here!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was one of the Ayramun who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been scrambling around, trying to get all that stuff moved into Minting Rock. He was about halfway there, hugging a bulging sack of sand-dried meats when he heard Ayram shout his name. He immediately dropped the sack and then jogged on over to see what the fuss was about.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was happy to see that Moto\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s all-knowing smirk was absent. And there was a faint swipe-stain of blood from Mandri\u8217\'92s thigh on the shoulder of Moto\u8217\'92s formerly speckless garb. Mandri knew it wouldn\u8217\'92t wash out easily, and while it wasn\u8217\'92t justice, it did give Mandri a flutter of joy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Explain,\u8221\'94 Ayram said to Moto as he pointed to Mandri\u8217\'92s leg.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s what it looks like,\u8221\'94 Moto said. \u8220\'93The boy got bit by drag-belly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He was trying to run away and he jumped into a lizard pit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No I fucking didn\u8217\'92t!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s little outburst drew Ayram\u8217\'92s eye, and as Ayram Mandri found himself struck by a silly thought: this was the first time that Ayram had ever heard his voice. Ayram seemed to find it funny. He gave one amused grunt and that was enough to disarm Mandrameen completely.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Ayram set his imposing gaze back to Moto. He said,\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Explain why this boy was running away from you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto shrugged his shoulders shook his head as if perplexed. He had to get his body involved in the lie. That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s the first rule one learns as a child - when faced with consequences, the whole body has got to get involved to sell the lie. But of course, all that gesticulating, it\u8217\'92s not really selling the lie, it\u8217\'92s letting everyone know that you\u8217\'92re going to cause a fuss if you get called out on the lie, and if people think that will be more trouble then the whole thing is worth, you might just get away with it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I honestly have no idea. I must have said something, but I don\u8217\'92t know what, and then Mandri here threw a fit and ran off. I think the boy has got a dirty Spark. It\u8217\'92s like he\u8217\'92s not got the will to live. You should have seen it, the lizard was chewing on his leg and he didn\u8217\'92t even try to fight the thing off. Chopper had to jump in and save him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With each word that Moto spoke, Mandrameen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face scrunched up tighter and tighter. He made every effort short of squealing to let Ayram know what he really thought of Moto. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If Ayram noticed, he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t show it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram said to Moto, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You didn\u8217\'92t do what I told you to do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How could I?\u8221\'94 Moto griped. \u8220\'93Ask him yourself, he won\u8217\'92t say a thing!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t have time for this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram then bent down and examined Mazyd Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robed lump. Ayram lifted the robe to reveal Obo\u8217\'92s face - he looked to be dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take this one,\u8221\'94 Ayram commanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto bent down and grabbed Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s limp arm, and pulled the rest of Obo up. He made a little show of taking care not make Obo\u8217\'92s wounded stumps worse off. A courtesy he\u8217\'92d denied Mandri. Once Obo was comfortably tucked under Moto\u8217\'92s arm, Moto took off.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Ayram turned to Mandri and said,\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re handling the pain well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not that bad.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s hard to believe. I\u8217\'92ve been bitten by a drag belly and it had me doubled over.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Must be a different kind of drag belly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Must be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri felt Ayram was trying to get the measure of him. Never more transparant had a man tried to get the measure of him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can you walk?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stood up, walked over to the disappearing pile of discarded things, grabbed the large iron pot by its rim, and lifted it up with ease. Then he brought it over, set it down next to Mandri, picked Mandri up by the scruff of his shirt, and then dropped him into the pot. The pot was so spacious that there was room enough in it for another whole Mandrameen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then, with nary a grunt of effort, Ayram carried that Mandri-stuffed pot all the way over to Minting Rock. When they came to entrance to cave, which turned out to be a narrow slit in the rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s base, Ayram set the pot down and then kicked it, spilling Mandrameen into the dirt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was an ill omen, finding you dead in the hills,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. \u8220\'93I hear whispers that you\u8217\'92re a demon from Shis. Considering everything that has happened, I\u8217\'92m inclined to believe it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know what to say. Obo had suggested he tell the simple truth, but Mandri found himself cowering there in dirt before Ayram, and anything a cowering man says might be misconstrued as anxious deception. It wasn\u8217\'92t a question, anyways. He didn\u8217\'92t have to say anything. Best thing to do was just lay there and be quiet. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then his mind was pricked by that other thing Obo said: make yourself useful.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri realized that it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a good look to not be able, in the most literal sense, to carry his own weight. So he decided, then, to get up and walk on his own. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri rolled onto his stomach and pushed himself up onto his good knee, and from there, he set his hands on the rock itself to hauled himself up to a standing position.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think I can try to walk from here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram was looking down him with a unquivered eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So it\u8217\'92s into the hole, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram reached down and grabbed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left arm. The width of Ayram\u8217\'92s hand matched the length of Mandri\u8217\'92s bicep, and his gigantic fingers encircled the arm a whole half over. With Mandri steadied, Ayram lead him into Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The entry hall of Minting Rock was a dark and narrow passage which, after a few steps, opened up into a short and fat tube. It was more than tall enough for Mandri, but Ayram had to duck. There was enough room to pass by the other Ayramun who were headed in the opposite direction, though when Ayram passed they gave him a respectful berth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri marveled at how much time and effort it must have taken to carve out this little tube, however, this was for just for starters, because at the end tube, there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a passage leading down into a natural cave like Mandri expected, there was a curling flight of steps leading up. This meant that Minting Rock itself was a building, a hollowed bulk of sandstone . Mandri felt himself tremble with excitement of even being in such a place. It was every little boy\u8217\'92s dream of desert hideout come true.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri climbed the steps, climbed up into the meat of the rock, bumping some nameless Ayramun in the dark, and then he came into Minting Rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s central chamber. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 into two revoultions of a sMandri was suprised to see that, all along the ceiling and wall were long bore shafts that let light and air into the hall. The point sources of light then bounced the hall, creating a soft red glow that diffused the chisel-prick texture of the sandstone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s surface. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The only bad thing about it was the smell. Such a confined space, with so many unwashed bandit folk, the odor was dank.}
\par\plain \f2\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was trying to reason with the old witch Elrahet, who was trying to slap Mazyd Obo into consciousness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That won\u8217\'92t work,\u8221\'94 Moto said.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A few shuffling feet and a moment later.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a column of Hrkan riders headed this way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is there? I didn\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How did you do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t do it on purpose. You must believe me. Did you really think that the Hrkan lords would put so much money into making a thing like me without devising a way to track me down should I get loose?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto interrupted. Dead seriousness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They can track you? How?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wish I knew. If we Mazydai knew how we were being tracked, we would have devised countermeasures a long, long time ago.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram spoke up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is no matter. You are going to open up that little mouth of yours and melt those fifty riders into glass.\u8221\'94}
