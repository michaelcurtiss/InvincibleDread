\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When humanity was young and most people were living in dens like lizards, the people who called themselves the Solgruin were building civilization. They built the first canals and the first sustenance fields; a grid of plots measuring 6 by 1, clean and even rectangles set just off the banks of the Solket river, mapped out by the first cadastral texts. They had the first plow oxen, the first harvests, and the first age of plenty, all followed by the first catastrophic drought, the first stretch of worn out land, and the first law of fallow. This was all long, long before rest of Old Jandri toddled to its feet, and it was a time that history would have forgot if not for the fact that when the Solgruin capital burned to the ground, the fires baked the scribal clay as hard as rocks and crumbling ruins kept them buried safe for centuries. One of the stories that survived was the story of the creation of the Goree Pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One day, Solgruin petitioners went to the temple of Solraheen, and outside the veil of His bedchamber, they sang their complaint to Him in structured verse - as it was proper etiquette to address the Creator with song, even if all you were doing was complaining about how the Goree mountains were too difficult to traverse. The Solgruin were set on the western side of the Goree, and eastern Jandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t far away by land, yet because of the Goree\u8217\'92s impenetrable physique, the only way to get there was by boat, a five day journey around the southern horn, and the ferrymen charged extortionate prices. The song ended by requesting, humbly, that Solraheen should part the mountains.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Solraheen asked why they would want to go to eastern Jandri, the Solgruin said that they wanted to spread Your word to our kin. The truth was that they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard rumors of gold laying on the ground in eastern Jandri. Naturally, Solraheen saw through their pretensions and denied their request.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A few hundred years later, the Solgruin forgot that Solraheen refused their forebears, and they went to Him a second time to ask, humbly, if He might part the mountains. This generation was more honest in their request, as they made clear their desires were mundane; they wanted to walk their caravans into eastern Jandri, that they might trade with the budding cities of Jeket and Shagota.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Again, Solraheen denied them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Time passed, the Solket river dwindled, the city\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s temple began to fail, and again, a new generation rose up and went before Solraheen and asked if He might part the mountains.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This third time, Solraheen answered with action. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak one day north of the city, and there he stomped on the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yet the Solgruin did not rejoice, for when Solraheen showed them what he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d done, He said to the them, \u8220\'93Look upon this scar which mars My creation and lament your insolence. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, it\u8217\'92s beauty gone. Cursed are you who pass through it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This story is taught in every Solitant school throughout the Hrkan world because its lesson is not obvious, and the process of discovering that lesson is meant to be a stepping stone to prepare students for some of the more unintuitive theologies, for if one operates solely on common sense and surface understandings, they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ll arrive at the wrong conclusion. It would seem that the story of the Goree Pass is one which highlights humanity\u8217\'92s self-centered hubris; Solraheen created the earth and all its beauty, and then humanity comes along, and in its presumptuous way, said to its Creator, \u8220\'93What you\u8217\'92ve made is great, but you know it really would be a lot better if we could just make a few changes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s how Mandrameen understood the story - it\u8217\'92s a warning to never put your own desires above Solraheen\u8217\'92s, else you might be cursed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But he was told that understanding was wrong.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Why?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Because his Solitant proctor said so.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The old man tried to explain that young Mandri was making a category error, that there is no difference between our desires and Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s, but Mandrameen wouldn\u8217\'92t have it. Even at the tender age of ten, he\u8217\'92d heard it all before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Our desires are Solraheen\u8217\'92s desires, for we are His tools, and a tool is an expression of purpose.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Humanity is His tool, one that He uses to shape creation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93As the desires of the wind shapes the dunes, and the desires of the water shapes the valleys, so too do the desires of humanity shape the rock and clay.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Virtuous desires, corrupting desires\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85 Humanity is reduced to an impersonal force, more in common with the wind and rain than the mind of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We are the painting, not the painter. We are the subject, not the audience.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And if we are not the intended audience, then it necessarily follows that there is no lesson for us in the story of the Goree pass, or in any story in particular. And if all we are is an animated drama with profound aesthetic appeal, then the Goree Pass is not an \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91ugly\u8217\'92 rent in the mountain range, it is an act in a play, one with a depth of meaning that transcends the capacity for human reason.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This is all a little bit much to lay on a gaggle of ten year olds. It begs the question, one which a precocious ten-year old might ask, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If stories aren\u8217\'92t meant for us, then why do we listen to and tell them?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To this, Solitants smirk and say, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Very good, you\u8217\'92re on the right track,\u8221\'94 and then they refuse to explicate, the only nod with a promising smile that suggests that the student is on the cusp of righteousness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen liked the story of the Goree Pass. There was something in it for him. It justified the act of ripping up a painting to spite a client, just as Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had spent a week and a small fortune on this painting, and he scrapped it because the woman who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d commissioned it said she wouldn\u8217\'92t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting\u8217\'92s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the King of the Huldolun, and the woman wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn\u8217\'92t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would go to her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a Hrkan Lord on the richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, \u8220\'93That looks just like your Puddles!\u8221\'94, and the woman would say, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s because it is my Puddles!\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Now, Mandri could have tried find a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with resentment, and as his fingers tore the canvas, a sense of justice motivated through his veins, and he tore it completely in half, right there in front of that woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came confused anger. Her voiced pitched up into the hysterics.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is wrong with you!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If Mandri had the power, he would have cursed that woman, just as Solraheen cursed those who journey the Goree Pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But even curses do little to dissuade people from defying their own desires. After all, here they were, the Ayramun, Mandrameen himself, venturing south in the cold shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 According to Moto, the Greskalun made their home inside the pass itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Either there was no curse and the story was just a story, or maybe the Solitants were right about not taking the surface meaning too seriously. Or, and this is what Moto believed, the curse was only meant for the Solgruin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto gestured grandly to the bright morning sky and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How could such a place be cursed?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s right was the open desert, and to his left were the Goree mountains, though they weren\u8217\'92t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Namid from spreading out of control. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Marching southward, came the first signs of Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spite, for the ground under Mandri\u8217\'92s feet grew uneven as rocks popped up out of the sand like roots, and the further south they went, the Goree\u8217\'92s wall grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground, and these cracks had long been rubbed smooth by an eon of blasting sand, rounding the edges, pillowing the seams, giving the them the appearance of infected, pustuled scars. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri could see the Goree Pass in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Moto informed Mandri that that splinter was a tower, a central column in a fortification which spanned the length of the pass, protecting the entrance in ancient times from ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage with all the boulders scattered about. Scrambling over those which were mostly buried. Some were the size of Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is what rock vomit looks like,\u8221\'94 said Seb. He was walking alongside Mandri and Obo, gums squelching on a Borcandi spine. \u8220\'93Solraheen punched the gut of the mountain, and the mountain spat these big rocks out. Can you believe it? Like kidney stones.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo, bouncing along in his litter, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have a peculiar talent for transforming the ineffable into the disgusting,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri agreed that the scattered boulders were a disquieting sight, for the amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been indescribable. Would have been unbelievable if it weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t Solraheen who\u8217\'92d done it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen imagined Solraheen standing up there on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant speck outshining the sun, his golden rays filtering through the dusty wind, and, well, a god such as He wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe for Him to set the fount of creation under the earth to bubbling, the mountains to quaking, and then the earth\u8217\'92s crust would burst open, and exploding out, miles up into the air, were stones the size of houses. A long sliver of the mountain reduced to rubble and spat out - vomited out - onto the desert plain. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The boulders dwarfed Mandrameen, and he supposed he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the only one feeling small, for Seb\u8217\'92s back seemed stuck in an almost reverential bow. That bend could be attributed to the weight of Seb\u8217\'92s pack and the long journey bearing on him, but the man\u8217\'92s face was alight in anxious wonder as his eyes fretted about and his jaw chewed his borcandi spines so hard that his muscles were going stiff. And the man wasn\u8217\'92t paying attention to where he was spitting the juice. Halfway up and over a light scramble over a low shelf of rock, he hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto\u8217\'92s heel. This precipitated a conflict.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do that again,\u8221\'94 Moto said, \u8220\'93And you\u8217\'92ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb lifted himself up onto. The two shared a long, sizing look. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t disrespect me like that,\u8221\'94 said Seb. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh? Me disrespect you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You threaten a man like that, it\u8217\'92s disrespectful.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You spit on my leg!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was an accident!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And I\u8217\'92m telling you, if you do it again, I\u8217\'92m going to .\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This a standoff.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri brushed past them, and then Purl. Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is how it gets when a fight is coming.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re expecting to get into a fight?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl scoffed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you think we\u8217\'92ve come all this way for?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Running from the Hrks,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re not running from them, we\u8217\'92re luring them into a trap.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that what we\u8217\'92re doing?\u8221\'94 Obo asked, his sarcastic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl huffed and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Once we meet up with the Greskalun, we\u8217\'92re going to trap the Hrks in the Goree Pass and capture their Riga, and once that\u8217\'92s done, you will no longer be a problem.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s all happening today?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl shrugged. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Probably,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But we\u8217\'92ve just crawled out of the most forsaken place on earth.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That doesn\u8217\'92t matter,\u8221\'94 Purl said. \u8220\'93If the Hrks are on us, it\u8217\'92ll be today.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri asked Obo. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you think, Obo? Are the Hrks right on our tail?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was quick to answer, like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been waiting for Mandri to ask. \u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t be sure,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl grunted. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What would he know about it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He doesn\u8217\'92t know about it, that\u8217\'92s why he said he can\u8217\'92t be sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He acts like he does know, that\u8217\'92s the thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo quipped, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl reluctantly set her eyes upon Obo. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then stop acting like you do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s he doing?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lip curled in disgust. \u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s got that sickly smile plastered on his face,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s just how he looks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl grunted as if she didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t agree. She to fix Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93These could be your final hours, creature.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They could be yours as well,\u8221\'94 Obo countered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re not getting it. If the Hrks do show up today, then regardless of who wins, you\u8217\'92re as good as dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo nestled into his pack. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If that\u8217\'92s true, then I suppose I shouldn\u8217\'92t be smiling.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is true.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So you say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See, that\u8217\'92s exactly it - you act like you know something I don\u8217\'92t\u8230\'85 and maybe you do, but I know things you don\u8217\'92t know too, and if you were smart you\u8217\'92d take that into account before getting all smugly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Purl, I don\u8217\'92t doubt that you have some unique experiences or information that I don\u8217\'92t, but what you don\u8217\'92t have - and this isn\u8217\'92t an insult, I\u8217\'92m simply being honest here - what you don\u8217\'92t have is insight. You don\u8217\'92t have understanding.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh-huh\u8221\'94.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was this feeling, not quite captured in any painting of the subject, that the Goree was not a mountain but a corpse of stone lying there on the desert, rotted through. The further south they walked, the clearer this became as the main body of the mountain, at first a smooth, sheer face, progressively crumbled into a heap. More and more loose stone was piled up at it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s base, and these shards, many scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass, were as friable as the brittlest shale. They crunched underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased; when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against a boulder, his palm punched a dent in it, as if it were a. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was, undoubtedly, a curse on this land, and Mandri and the Ayramun were fast approaching its source: the pass itself. Though the depths of the pass were hidden by the sharp angle from which Mandri viewed it, its presence marked by a black tower which poked out from it like a splinter stuck in a wound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If that tower had a truer name than \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91The Western Tower\u8217\'92, Mandri did not catch it among the nervous whispers of the Ayramun. A had settled in among them, and Mandri as well. He wasn\u8217\'92t worried as much about the Greskalun, he just didn\u8217\'92t like towers. Towers, as a general rule, were evil. A tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but it\u8217\'92d still have an air of evil because there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy; nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower. Everything else was cover for evil intentions, or otherwise monuments to human hubris, and this Tower, black and foreboding as it was, was a particularly striking example of the latter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There are certain schools of landscape painters which get paid handsomely to advertise certain places of the world, holy places mostly, holy places near markets that survive on pilgrim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s coin. For a good long while, The Western Tower was one such subject, because if people visited the tower, then mostly came up through old Sisli. So that\u8217\'92s what the tower was in Mandri\u8217\'92s mind, a hollow icon, symbol of greed, a perversion of a perversion, a scene rendered cheaply on kulp wood panels; the needle-like black tower set smack dab in the middle of the pass, though not in the middle of the painting, for the tower is always placed on that crutch for middling artists called the golden third. They do what they can with the sky and clouds, but it\u8217\'92s always a static scene, the black tower and its walls plugging up the pass, and travelers - more like a line of ants - being forced to pass through the tower\u8217\'92s gate for there\u8217\'92s no other way through. What\u8217\'92s clear is that this tower takes its role as a monument seriously. It stands there and forces all to reckon with it, a spike of unnatural black in a barren, red world; it doesn\u8217\'92t belong, and that\u8217\'92s all one can ask from a good monument, be big, and look like you don\u8217\'92t belong.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 These paintings are sometimes titled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91The Gate of Shis\u8217\'92, though they\u8217\'92re never so haunting. The real approach to the Tower, however, was another matter. The paintings couldn\u8217\'92t capture how the brittle rock slopes threatened to come galloping down upon Mandri every time a lizard stirred from its nook at his approach.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t possible to keep away from the rocks. Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by their Hrkan pursuit, so he pursued a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo without seeing him, but he didn\u8217\'92t ask, he kept quiet lest he draw a fusillade of annoyed glances for asking a simple question.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone kept quiet, whatever cheer had for making out of the was gone now that word of Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s prediction had spread amongst them. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof of the Greskalun\u8217\'92s presence, and their legs had picked up the pace, until it all came to halt when they rounded a shale-strewn corner and the Goree pass opened up before them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tall, black stone walls sprawled across the gap, and the great tower stood proudly, right in the middle, just as the paintings had predicted. Unlike the paintings, there weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t any people, no trickle of ants passing into the tower\u8217\'92s mouth, though the mouth was wide open.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Greskalun were not there. No one was. There wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a sign they\u8217\'92d be back. The scene was of tombs and ghost towns, tribes driven out from the .}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe they all retreated deeper into the pass,\u8221\'94 said Seb. \u8220\'93Into their sanctuary.\u8221\'94 At this point, Seb was chewing two spines at once so his words were garbled in slosh of spit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Retreated from what?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl was moping off to the side. The news of the Greskalun\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s disappearance weighed heaviest on her. \u8220\'93Maybe it\u8217\'92s the pox,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb chummed up to the idea with a fire in his eyes, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That could be it! It\u8217\'92s happened before, right? That\u8217\'92s what they do whenever the pox gets them, they run back into their caves.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah remained unimpressed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And where\u8217\'92s the sign of fire?\u8221\'94 She asked. \u8220\'93They would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.\u8221\'94 Wooden structures set up against the walls.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hogwash,\u8221\'94 said Seb with a grin. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How could you look at a place like this and not think it\u8217\'92s cursed. Everyone knows it\u8217\'92s cursed. Solraheen said Himself that anyone who walked this path was cursed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, He said that the people of Solket that Solraheen cursed if that used the pass, and last I checked, we ain\u8217\'92t Solket.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was, all this while, a faint whispering in the air. The first time Mandri heard it, it cricked his neck, the second time, he stopped and turned around asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is that?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto brushed past Mandri and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s vultures.\u8221\'94 He pointed up. Mandri looked up and saw nothing but a sinuous stripe of blue sky being squeezed by the canyon face. Then he heard the sound again, and on queue, there was a speck in the sky, a vulture soaring on thermals high overhead, in sight for only a moment as it curled back around towards whence it came. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The faint, wheezing screeches of birds, filtering down through the canyon to reach Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ears like hissing whispers. Knowing what he knew about carrion eaters, Mandri thought he might prefer it if the whispering really was the haggard language of the rocks echoing Solraheen\u8217\'92s curse.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl stepped into the circle and pointed an accusatory finger at the Mazyd. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He knew the Greskalun wouldn\u8217\'92t be here, and that was miles ago.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo flicked his penetrating eye towards Purl. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I know you types abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when-.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but all the same, the Hrks didn\u8217\'92t do it. The Goree pass is not yet in sight of the Hrkan lords.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl snapped at that remark, though her way of snapping was subdued. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everything is in sight of the Hrkan lords,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This drew a pronounced sigh from Obo. The was rolling off his tongue. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe so. Maybe so,\u8221\'94 he said, and then, \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suppose that any of you have an appreciation for how much grain it takes to sustain a fortification of that size. And this surrounding area isn\u8217\'92t exactly fertile land.\u8221\'94 Obo, head , looked down at the gravel strewn sand to prove his point. \u8220\'93If any of you were students of history, you might know that anytime there\u8217\'92s a drought in the river plain yonder south, this tower is the first to feel it. I suspect that\u8217\'92s what\u8217\'92s happened here; the Greskalun began to starve and simply moved on to greener pastures.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet. It was the first words Mandri had heard her speak for days. The words came from her throat as if they were not used to them. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gresh - hghhmmm - Greskal would not abandon the pass,\u8221\'94 she said.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then you agree. Why would \u8216\'91soft-bellied Hrks\u8217\'92 want to live in a place like this? If there was a system of support in place, then\u8230\'85 If you are asking me if there are Hrkans waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb scowled back, then said to Ayram, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Greskalun could still be there. Pox, drought, it doesn\u8217\'92t matter - when things go bad for them, they go into the mountain. That\u8217\'92s what they do.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Or maybe not,\u8221\'94 Obo said, his tone suggesting . Instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter, his elbows stretching the leather as they twisted around. Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t help but chuckle at the sight of it. Obo looked like a toddler all swaddled up in his pack, trying to get comfortable.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing?\u8221\'94 Moteah wondered.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What in the world?\u8221\'94 Seb exclaimed.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo pulled the bone fully out of his pack and held it aloft for all to see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93Is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.\u8221\'94}

A bone in the ground isn\u8217\'92t unusual. Where else are you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you\u8217\'92d have something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, let him speak,\u8221\'94 said Moteah.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb looked to Ayram for support, but Ayram was standing silent as usual, narrowing the world between just him and whatever he was looking at, and he was looking at that bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo turned it round in his hands and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Every bone tells a story\u8230\'85 gender, age, health, and you see this fracture? It\u8217\'92s an unusual fracture, isn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo ran his finger along the length of the fracture. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a clean fracture, a , it was a splintered fracture along the length of it, an open tube.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram turned the bone around with a bit more care.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram , and Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind ran awash with images of a barbarian gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, teeth strings of fat and }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet stomped over and took the bone from Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the. She turned the whole thing over in her hands, thumbed a groove with some contemplation, then handed the bone right back. She and Ayram shared a look, and the two in unison turned their backs on the others and marched off to where they could share words unheard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Unheard to all except Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are they saying?\u8221\'94 Mandri whispered out the side of his mouth.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I suppose we shall find out.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he arrived, breathless and , he did not wait for any questions. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s something you need to see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Greskalun?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I climbed the tower,\u8221\'94 he said in between catching breath. \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no Greskalun. That much I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And the Hrks?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram cast a glance aside at Elrahet, and old witch nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pick up the Mazyd. You\u8217\'92re walking up front with me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At pace they came to the tower and it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gate. Cobbled nature, ancient, leaning just so, Mandri looked up, and from this sharp angle he could see how the tall tower didn\u8217\'92t quite go straight up, the carpet of it\u8217\'92s bricks bulged, twisted, and leaned forward ever so slightly, come crashing down on him. And then there was the arch of the gate, by the gate\u8217\'92s long metal teeth which hung ominously above Ayram\u8217\'92s head. The tunnel itself was as large as the hall of the Hrkhale, big enough to send the sound of Ayram\u8217\'92s spud bar thumping against the dirt rushing back at them. Aside from this metronomic beat, they passed through this dark in silence, casting wary glances at each large doorframe that pocketed the arching brickwork, drifts of sand sagging against each frame. Moto in front, a guide. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stops.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Looks back, shadow over his face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick courtyard as old as the tower itself, dusted and with centuries of wagon of wagon traffic wearing wheel ruts into road, tracking all the way up the gently rising slope that lead into the darkness of the canyoned pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In this courtyard was a haphazard scattering of wooden poles, each thick as a cow\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly and taller than,  sticking out of the ground like an errant volley of arrows. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Desecrations, all of them. Cursed heaps of tortured souls. Such was the defilement that the condemnations leaped into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind as readily as the very sight of the profane sculptures themselves, which themselves were so present that Mandri\u8217\'92s stomach into fits of convulsion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The nearest was but five yards away - a man, who, like many, was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of the Solitant pilgrim. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, was stuck in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore as the broken pottery that was his skull seemed kept together by the grace of god.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri knew enough to know that the injuries inflicted on this poor pilgrim had some special significance. In the darker halls of Hrkan lords there hung portraits of martyrs which made rich use of similar tortures. Mandri never paid them much mind because the common consensus was that to even look upon such sights was dangerous. And here he was, standing before thirty of them - maybe there were fifty - to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The only clear statement that Mandri could interpret here, aside from the plain blasphemy of it, was gleaned from the chain wrapped tight around the pilgrim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck, a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t actually see it because the Pilgrim\u8217\'92s neck folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was; it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But what were these other afflictions? The pilgrim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s scalp had been crudely - brutally - shaved to make a gleaming madman\u8217\'92s crown, and his eyes had been gouged out and then the bloody sockets were filled with ash. Every single one of these injuries had been done for a purpose, as every single one of the poor souls littered about the courtyard had been bent and broken in precisely the same way. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What it all meant, Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know. Ayram frowned and knelt before this cursed statue. Even kneeling, he was near Mandri\u8217\'92s height. The giant bowed head, and he prayed a silent prayer for the poor soul who was hanging there on the pole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are they doing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri asked in return, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who could do a thing such as this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, this is not such aberrant behavior for desert folk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve seen this before?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not this particular brand of cruelty, no. But when people are hungry and afraid they get desperate for salvation, and something about human character trends them toward the idea that if they kill the right person, all their troubles will go away. That\u8217\'92s almost certainly what happened here. This itinerant priest probably wandered along at the height of the Greskalun\u8217\'92s desperation, and they saw him, took him for a servant of Moll, blamed him for their hunger, and strung him up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked up in astonishment and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s still alive!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They are all alive.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t believe it. He looked up at the poor man\u8217\'92s face in grotesque amazement. A body so broken that it couldn\u8217\'92t possibly alive.

Still, if anyone knew what was happening here, it was a bloodwitch like Elrahet. No doubt there was some curse at play. Only a curse could stay the hand of death from reaching a man so horribly . Elrahet\u8217\'92s twisted expression confirmed it, she was seeing things that made her wince . At length, a shadow passed over her face, and she said grimly, \u8220\'93We do not have time to help this man.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto blanched at her words. An unfocused gaze and a furrowed brow as he turned some question over in his mind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93At least let me kill him,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face grew stern as stone. \u8220\'93Death would not grant this one freedom,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93One does not deal with so black a shrine with steel. Only the breath of Sol can chase away the powers that bind his Spark to that pole.\u8221\'94}

He then stood up, walked backwards out of respect for the suffering, then turned to his flock and said, \u8220\'93We must leave this place at once.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah brushed passed him and said through a curled lip, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There are no Greskalun.\u8221\'94}

Mandri didn\u8217\'92t pay them any attention, because neither were going to convince Ayram to do anything different. The man\u8217\'92s mind was made up to defer towards Elrahet. Still, Moteah and Seb bickered, and while they were arguing, a whispered came from Obo into Mandri\u8217\'92s ear.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The southern slope, while , was stratified into three layers separated by two flat clefts of mostly unbroken sandstone. The first cleft was not that high up, maybe twenty feet or so, and on it stood many boulders, though Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s took notice of a flattish triangular rock that stood up and swayed back like a shark\u8217\'92s-tooth. Poking out from behind that rock, like a weed, was a goat\u8217\'92s horn. Mandri didn\u8217\'92t take it to be a horn at first, because there was only one and it curved downwards instead of up. He thought it was a withered branch of a some out-of-sight stump, but then the thing moved, floating into view was a dark, savage face, vaguely human in appearance, with a deep-set, shadowed brow and sunken cheeks, a face which protruded out more than faces usually do, which combined with a flat nose, gave the impression of a snout.}

Its yellow teeth flashed, and Mandri shrieked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stumbled backwards and pointed up at creature as it ducked back behind its rock. Mandri looked around to see if anyone else had noticed it, but everyone was looking at him.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stroked his beard, and then he looked up at the sky, arced his shoulders, and he took in a breath that could fill a horse\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach. When he turned round there was a fire in his eyes which Mandri had not seen since Minting Rock, and when Ayram marched over to where Mandri stood, and reached over his shoulder, Mandri was rooted to the spot simmering just under the surface.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram reached over Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder, pulled Obo out from his litter by the skull, and in one rude, fluid motion, Ayram flung the Mazyd towards the scribe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The black horse whinnied in alarm as Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s withered, legless form slid pitifully on the dirt towards it, and the scribe\u8217\'92s eyes were agog with disbelief.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this?\u8221\'94 the scribe asked as struggled to settle his horse\u8217\'92s fright.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stepped towards Obo, casual as a dog , and he pointed to Obo with his blackened iron bar and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t recognize a Mazyd when you see one?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And all this was to Mandri. Was that Obo, usually unperturbed by rough treatment, usually amused by seriousness, was himself in a serious concern. It seemed the he was afraid to move or speak, lest he upset the delicate tension that was building.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribe himself was not so. His face twisted into wry smile at the sight of Obo naked and afraid.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This Mazyd still has a Minder?\u8221\'94 the scribe asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram gestured towards Purl, and the scribes face went alight at the sight of the girl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s missing hand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This simplifies things\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 the old man mused. The wry smile that spread out on his lips suggested it simplified things in his favor. He rocked back in his saddle, and as he did, smugly, Mandri was struck with a sudden burst of what can only be called inspiration.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He wanted to paint the scene.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This urge was as sudden and as uncompromising as the fussiest hunger. Inspiration sometimes imposes that , though Mandri hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t felt the urge in years so he wasn\u8217\'92t sure that this was the exactly same thing as inspiration, whatever ancient philosopher had coined the term might be able to say, but as Mandri saw it, inspiration was never as vivid as this. It had never planted him so firmly in the present as now, for he was filled completely with the sudden appreciation for how the world had conspired to bring that scribe, Ayram, and Mazyd Obo together, and how he was there too, just the man to capture the scene, just so happened to be at an angle which gave the three figures a pyramidal compositional frame; the scribe oh his horse, and Ayram, and Obo on the ground bridging the gap between them, and underneath these dry facts was a girding of symbolism - only it wasn\u8217\'92t symbolism at all, because symbolism is what artists do when they\u8217\'92ve got nothing interesting to say, but this composition here was a living, breathing arrangement, put together by a divine hand, so it could hardly be said to be symbolism. Symbolism is always a kind of fantasy, but this scene here was a message.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribe, this Hrkan man, did not }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 represent }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hrkan power sitting up on its high horse, he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 was}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  that power, and Ayram, standing tall and proud, was not a symbol of the outland peoples he was their paragon, and in between them was Mazyd Obo, a creature constructed for the sole purpose of setting the affairs of men in order, and look where he was, destitute in the dirt, scarred and cowering and naked as the two men looked on with satisfied, if challenging, glares.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If he Mandri had only had the materials, he would have dropped everything and started sketching.  The thing about these moments is that if they aren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t sketched as you see them,  Mandri knew if he didn\u8217\'92t sketch it he would not remember. these things never persist in the mind. As soon as attention breaks the is lost. One night\u8217\'92s sleep and it\u8217\'92s lost forever. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  He , and seemed to relish in the sight of Obo being brought so low, but his amusement was cut short when his horse  agitation and began to clip-clop it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s agitation, bouncing the scribe uncomfortably in his saddle. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Settled down you crooked beast!\u8221\'94 the old man shouted. He gave his horse a foul kick in the ribs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I feared I\u8217\'92d have to treat with a Mazyd, but here you are! That is a treat!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think you\u8217\'92ll find that I drive a harder bargain than any Mazyd ever could.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A wry smile spread thinly scribe, and the man cast a suggestive glance at the army behind him. He leaned forward in his saddle, made a joke of assessing Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s motley crew, and then he said to Ayram, in apparent disbelief, \u8220\'93You have complaints my terms?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I do,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribe chuckled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whatever complaints you may have can be assuaged. We come only for the lord Mazyd, and we will give you a fair offer. Now, you and your outland clan have broken the law, and so Nature dictates that you should be tromped under by a Hrkan boot, but Prudence dictates that this matter should be resolved cleanly, quickly, and peaceably. Now, here is what is going to happen if you \u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram nodded, as if . He looked up at the sky as if he were contemplating. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93One thing my father taught me, is that it is not possible to resolve a conflict peaceably if both sides do not truly understand eachother.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is not the time for your haggling arts. Speak what you want plainly and if it is reasonable it is yours. The sparing of your lives is already a monumental gift.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think it is important that you understand the nature of my complaint with your terms. It\u8217\'92s not a simple as you have something that I want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram marches up. Smacks the guys horse in the head and it crumples to the ground. Guy scambles to get away pitifully, but Ayram leapt upon him as fast.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me, what seems my complaint to you?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram turned to his band of outland clay. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It seems I have not made my complaint clear enough to this man! It\u8217\'92s time you understand how it feels to be outland clay.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Forthwith he brought the point of his spud bar down with the speed of a blur and plunged it into the back of the scribe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hand, pinning it to the ground.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribe screamed, into garbled words. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Harber of the Shon, I curse you!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes! We\u8217\'92ve come to an understanding!\u8221\'94}

Here and there the sun could be seen, peeking through the split overhead, though its light never reached the sandy floor directly, instead it bounced around and absorbed the redness of the sandstone and set the rolling earth aglow. Now and then the canyon walls belled out and Mandri could see the slopes of the tallest plateaus stretching up beyond vision, but most of these hours were spent with naught but a narrow, sinuous stripe of blue sky above, squeezed by the red shadow of the stone. }
