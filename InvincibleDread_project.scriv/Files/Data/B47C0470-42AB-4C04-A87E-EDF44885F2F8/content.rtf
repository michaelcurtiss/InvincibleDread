\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When humanity was young and most were living in dens like lizards, the people of Solket were building civilization. They built the first canals and the first sustenance fields; a lengthwise grid of plots measuring 6 by 1, lining the bank of the Solgrun river, mapped out by the first cadastral texts. They had the first plow oxen, the first harvests, and the first age of plenty, all followed, of course, by the first stretch of worn out land, the first resettlement, and the first law of fallow. This was long, long before rest of Old Jandri toddled to its feet, a time that history would have forgot if not for the scribbled slabs of clay which baked hard in the fires that eventually burned Solket to the ground.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One of the stories that survived Solket was the story of the creation of the Goree Pass. One day, petitioners went to the temple of Solket, went before Solraheen, and complained that the Goree mountains were too difficult to traverse. Eastern Jandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t far away by land, yet because of the Goree\u8217\'92s impenetrable physique, the only way to get there was by boat, a five day journey around the southern horn, and the ferrymen charged extortionate prices.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The people prostrated themselves before Solraheen and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If You may, we humbly beg, please, part the mountains.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94, asked Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So that we may spread your word to our kin.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The truth was that they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard rumors of gold laying on the ground in eastern Jandri. Solraheen saw through their pretensions and said no.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A few hundred years later, the people of Solket forgot that Solraheen refused their forebears, and they went to Him again and asked, humbly, that He might part the mountains. This generation was more honest, as they made clear their desire to walk their caravans into eastern Jandri, that they might trade with the budding cities of Jeket and Shagota.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Again, Solraheen said no.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Time passed, the Solgrun river dwindled, the city\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s temple began to fail, and again, a new generation rose up and went before Solraheen and asked if He might part the mountains.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This third time, Solraheen answered with action. He walked to the Goree mountains, climbed a peak two days north of Solket, and there he stomped on the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yet the people of Solket did not rejoice, for when Solraheen had finished, He said to the them, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Goree impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, look upon this scar which mars My creation and lament your insolence. A way is made, ugly in aspect, and cursed are you who pass through it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen had an unorthodox interpretation of this story. For him, it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t about the Goree Pass or why it was cursed, it was about the fact that Solraheen had created the earth and all its beauty, and then humanity came along, and in its inimitable way, said to the Creator, \u8220\'93What you\u8217\'92ve made is great and all, and we love it, but you know it really would be a lot better if we could just make a few changes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In other words, this story was an attempt to lay bare humanity\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s self-centered hubris. Creation doesn\u8217\'92t need fixing, or changing, and it\u8217\'92s the worst kind of presumption to place one\u8217\'92s own desires regarding Creation above Solraheen\u8217\'92s.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But the Solitants do not read the story that way. They would say that Mandrameen was making a category error, for they claim that there is no difference between our desires and Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s, for He created us, and so our desires must be His desires, else he would have created us differently. In this sense, humanity is a tool, one that Solraheen uses to shape creation. The desires of the wind shapes the dunes, and the desires of the water shapes the valleys, so too do the desires of humanity shape the rock and clay, and the mechanics of desire are all one package - virtuous desires, corrupting desires - it\u8217\'92s an interplay of world-bendign forces, the cosmic drama, good and evil, white against black, contrast. Everything always coming back to contrast. The Goree Pass, that \u8216\'91ugly\u8217\'92 rent in the mountains, becomes a symbol with a depth of meaning that transcends the capacity for human focus, and that, in itself, is beautiful.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri knew there was no point in arguing theology with anyone, much less a Solitant priest whose entire life was spent chasing the high of righteousness. And he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t feel a }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 need}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to argue because the truth of the matter was evident in the story itself, and evident in practical reality as well - do something for someone else, and when comes familiarity comes a complaint. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s even worse when people paid him to do something. It didn\u8217\'92t matter his expertise, people still have the expectation that they get to have a say. Once before Mandri ripped up a painting to spite a client, just as Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite humanity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had spent a week and a small fortune on that painting, and he scrapped it because the woman who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d commissioned it said she wouldn\u8217\'92t pay unless there was a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting\u8217\'92s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the King of the Huldolun, and the woman wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn\u8217\'92t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would go to her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a Hrkan Lord on the richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, \u8220\'93That looks just like your Puddles!\u8221\'94, and the woman would say, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s because it }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  my Puddles!\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Now, Mandri could have kept the painting as it was and hoped to find a buyer, but there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a certain emotional pleasure, feeling the canvas tear in his hands, the look of fright on the woman\u8217\'92s face, then confused anger.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is wrong with you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is wrong with }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 you?}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 best explained as a kind of righteous indignation, sacred, in a sense, if the story of the Goree Pass is anything to go by.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Worse was when Mandri was in dire financial straits and couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t afford to rip up the painting. He had to actually fulfill the fantastical requests that only ever made things more conventional and cliche. And always these people liked the end result better. A man once wagged his finger in the air and proclaimed what Mandri had made was perfect, just as he imagined, when in truth Mandri had just copied the composition from a friend after reading the clients form.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And no doubt most people preferred the Goree Mountains to what Solraheen had initially created. And here they were, the Ayramun, Mandri and MazydObo, venturing south in the cold shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for that very pass. Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s right was the open desert, and to his left were the Goree mountains, though they weren\u8217\'92t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, wind-carved, peakless walls of red sandstone, the whole thing like giant red wave rolling into the desert, a of a thousand plateaus.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then, southward, southward, came the first signs of where Solraheen had planted his foot. The ground itself grew uneven as rocks started to pop up out of the earth like roots, and the Goree wall was more worn, pitted, and cracked, }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 and as the Ayramun weaved further up into the mountain\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow, and weave a trail around scattered boulders. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri could already hear the , even if it was heretical - \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s just more visual interest in the scar. More interesting shapes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri knew they were in the pass proper when they passed into a shattered split in the rock that was barely wider than the width of his shoulders.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a squeezed, striated canyon, and in places the rock overhead was flanged by wind erosion. At times the rising sun could be seen ahead peeking through the split overhead, though its light rarely reached the sandy floor. Now and then the canyon walls belled out and Mandri could see the slopes of the mountains stretching up beyond vision, but most of these early hours were spent with naught but a narrow, sinuous stripe of blue sky above, constricted by the purple shadow of the stone. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t normally suffer from the tight spaces, but all the while the air was buzzing with the faint, wheezing screeches of vultures soaring on thermals high overhead, out of sight, sometimes glimpsed. These birds were so far out that their shrieks reached Mandri\u8217\'92s ears like whispers, and it got him to wondering if it wasn\u8217\'92t really the haggard language of the rocks whispering Solraheen\u8217\'92s curse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When the Ayramun paused their march to scrape handfuls of water in a natural rock basin sheltered from the sun, Mandri wondered aloud, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I take it no one else is concerned about Solraheen\u8217\'92s curse?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This was the first bit of speech of the day that didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t concern the practicalities of navigation, and its seemed to sting Elrahet. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What on earth are you on about?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, \u8220\'93The whole story about how Solraheen said anyone who walked this path was cursed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not cursed,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not cursed,\u8221\'94 Purl added.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The usually chatty MazydObo spoke for the fist time that morning. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93According to the historical record, It most certainly is cursed,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What would you know about it?\u8221\'94 Purl said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You people keep asking me that question\u8230\'85 The sum of Hrkan knowledge is contained within my mind. Solraheen cursed this place when the people of Solket annoyed him about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s the people of Solket that Solraheen cursed,\u8221\'94 said Purl, \u8220\'93not us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Perhaps. That is one charitable interpretation of His words, but even so, you might be a descendant of the Solket. You\u8217\'92d have no real way of knowing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Solraheen would not visit the sins of the father upon the child.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He wouldn\u8217\'92t? Doesn\u8217\'92t he do just that in the story of the-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet spat upon the floor. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What you read in your libraries is not reality. Half the verse is dried spunk, the other half is naught but aimless palpations searching for the truth.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not true. Where sources agree, we can find something like the solid ground of history. It\u8217\'92s clear that during Solraheen\u8217\'92s first quiescence, He stated that-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What would you know about Solraheen\u8217\'92s quiescence?\u8221\'94 Elrahet spat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What could }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  possibly know about it?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Obo countered, \u8220\'93All there is, is the historical record. And the record says that those who travel the pass are cursed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto had been looking for an opportunity to speak, and he took it now with an eager. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The outland tribes use the pass all the time,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93And look how well that\u8217\'92s going for you people. Ever since the first tribesman wandered through the pass and was struck dead by a bolt of lightning, it\u8217\'92s been one catastrophe after the next for any who make the journey.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet folded her arms and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The first person to walk the pass was a Skinarun king, and he died in peace at a very old age.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said to Elrahet, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are the Skinarun today, I wonder?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before Elrahet could answer, a whistle came from further along the canyon - it was Ayram summoning his people, telling them to get a move on. Moto and Moteah shouldered their packs and went on, but Elrahet seemed to determined to get in a final word.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What happened to the Skinarun has nothing to do with this pass,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Far be it from me to explain how curses work to a blood witch, but isn\u8217\'92t that how curses work?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Curses don\u8217\'92t work at all. If they did, the Hrkan Lords would have choked in the sleep a long, long time ago.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram walks in, covers up Mazydobo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s folk about.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Around the bend, the way emptied out into a wider, sun-drenched valley. A mere twenty yards away, plugging up the middle of this valley, was a boulder twice the size of Minting Rock. It would have made the way impassable for a horse, but for the circular hole in its base, and this hole offered some estimation of the boulder\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s girth, for the sunlight peeking through the other side could be blotted out with an arm-length thumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To right of the hole\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s entrance, was the much anticipated man. He was robed in a honeyed yellow, the color of unassumption, and he was strapped into a pack the size and shape of a small shed wrapped in a . he was sitting, legs straight out and limp, pack against the rock, snoring.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a comically loud, open-mouthed, buck-toothed, snore. Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the only one who sniggered. And the man\u8217\'92s visage matched the - a wild scraggle of curly hair combed over a gleaming madman\u8217\'92s crown. The man\u8217\'92s narrow face was beset by two large jug ears, and Mandri thought he saw fleas crying out from the man\u8217\'92s pointed, scruff of a chin. There was an animal look to him, for his nose and mouth protruded out, almost into a snout, and while his crooked yellow teeth, it was clear that he didn\u8217\'92t lead a balanced diet. It was one of those faces that would be difficult to paint with a mother\u8217\'92s eyes. Absolutely nothing of the inner child was there.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram nudged the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left leg with his toe. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both Moto and Moteah dropped their shimmied out of their packs and Moto pulled out two long sandstone-colored cloaks, tossed one to Moteah, and then they clambered up the southern slope and disappeared from view.}

They built a city at the western mouth to keep the way shut, and this they did for a thousand years, until one Skinarun king had had enough. She said that this king had argued that it wasn\u8217\'92t }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 him}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  who had asked Solraheen to part the mountains, that it wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t him who sought to \u8216\'91fix\u8217\'92 creation, and so the curse did not apply to him. He argued that the sense of justice written on his heart imputed the knowledge that it was wrong to punish a child for the sins of the farther, so it would therefore be unjust for Solraheen to punish him for the sins of their forebears. Therefore, he came to believe that it must be no great sin to travel the pass, so long as he did it with a mindful reverence for the lesson that the pass teaches.}
