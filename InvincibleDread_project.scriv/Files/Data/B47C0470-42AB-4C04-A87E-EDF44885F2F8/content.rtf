\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram handed Mandri a few strings of jerked beef. It was a morning present to liven his spirits, and this it did with some aplomb, for the beef was spiced with peppercorn and, at some point in it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s humble existence, it had been soaked in a honeyed jelly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It buttered him up, but for what?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you see a man on our journey through the pass, don\u8217\'92t stop and point. Don\u8217\'92t stop walking for any reason, unless I say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram cringed as if Mandri had just spit on his boot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do what I say,\u8221\'94 Ayram said, \u8220\'93and do it without question. Once we\u8217\'92re through the pass, you can piss in the wind all you like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stomped off, his spud bar thudding against the dirt. His enormous pack was already fastened to his shoulders, and as he took off south along the edge of the mountain\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet, and the rest of the Ayramun got up and followed him. Moto stayed behind and gave Mandri a kick.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sighed, popped the last pinch of beef into his mouth, and savored its flavors. He stretched the moment with a beatific smile, and just before Moto was about to kick him again, he stood up, then put Obo in his litter. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As Mandri fitted the straps of Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter onto his back, Moto said, \u8220\'93One thing that Ayram forgot to mention: don\u8217\'92t talk.\u8221\'94 He gave Obo an evil eye and added, \u8220\'93That goes doubly for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But how will I pass the time?\u8221\'94 Obo asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In silence.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you so worried about? You said that every tribe would honor the sanctity of Goree Pass.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not at night. We can\u8217\'92t be found there at night, so we have to get through it in one day, which will be easy enough if you get a move on, Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright, alright.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri set off at a clip to catch up to Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s column.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They walked for an hour in the blue shadow of the mountains, Ayram the mother duck in front, and Moto in the back, with everyone in the middle keeping a tight formation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Twice Mandri clipped Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s heels. The first time she ignored it. The second, she stopped and glared at him. Mandri said sorry and spiced it with a sheepish grin, then added that his legs were too used to flat ground. The rocks here popped up like roots, and it was hard to take his eyes off the massive, swooping, wind-carved edifices that towered to his left. The great bulk of the sandstone had such a smooth, cupped curve, that it looked like a giant red wave rolling into the desert.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As they walked south, the character of the stone changed. It was more fractured, split, and crumbly. The ground was littered with boulders, they had to weave up into the foot of the mountain, and weave a trail around scattered boulders.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As far as passes go, the Goree Pass was not easily passable. By the time their course headed east, the way was a maze of swerving stone pillars and water-carved canyons the width of person. Mandri tried to map the place mentally, but gave up the third time that Ayram led them into a dead end. More of a canyon root system, as if a tree the size of a storm cloud grew here, and it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s roots had carved out these paths.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Striated canyons. Flanged red rock. At times the canyon walls belled out and Mandri could see the slopes of the mountains stretching up beyond vision, and those mountains weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the only thing that took getting used to. The air was buzzing with the faint, wheezing screeches of vultures soaring on thermals high overhead, out of sight, glimpsed, so far out that these shrieks reached Mandri\u8217\'92s ear like whispers. If he didn\u8217\'92t know better, he would have thought it was the haggard language of the rocks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And there were delights in these canyon paths - pools of water resting in shallow basins, sheltered from the sun, deep enough for Mandri to scrape a handful and splash his face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s too easy to personify a landscape. Every painter does it. A rolling hill becomes a . A mountain becomes a. to greater or lesser degrees. A landscape has a character. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo gives sharp whistle, Mandri to cringe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stopped the march. He stepped out of line and glared at Mandri. Mandri pointed his thumb at Obo. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do I need to muzzle you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s clarient drawl d, \u8220\'93Could you please pick up that bone over there? On the other side of that rock, there\u8217\'92s a bone that I\u8217\'92d like to take a look at.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri craned his neck around to see what Obo was talking about. In so doing, around to see.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, please turn back around.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want to see what you\u8217\'92re talking about.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto had wandered over to a knee-high shoulder of rock, and he knelt down to pick something up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A gleaming white ball joint and a short, splintered haft of bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a leg knuckle,\u8221\'94 Moto said. He handed it to Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s called a femur.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Elrahet pushed through the gathering crowd and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s the matter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazyd wants to look at this bone.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone looked at Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See that fracture?\u8221\'94 Obo said, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s an unusual fracture.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s unusual about it?\u8221\'94 asked Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Breaking a bone along its length is not easy, not likely to happen accidentally.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In Ayrams probing hands the bone looked like a child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. He said, \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re saying there\u8217\'92s been a killing in the Pass?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto pointed at some discoloration on the and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Somewhat recent, too, by the looks of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not just a killing,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93A blow to the leg would not result in a medial split like that. Well, that }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 could}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  happen, but the chances of that would be one in a million. Accidental.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet grumbled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s your point?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri site. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating other people... See, that is the kind of fracture a human makes when he wants to gnaw on the spongy marrow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind ran flush with images of a barbarian gnawing on a bone as if it were an ear of corn. He turned around to get another look at that bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of his finger.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How far away are the Hrks?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only thing I can say for certain is that they\u8217\'92re headed this way, and not just from the east. They\u8217\'92ll be looking to catch us coming out of the Pass from the west as well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ahhh, fuck.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should be }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 moving,}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93So what if there\u8217\'92s a bone? It doesn\u8217\'92t mean anything. This is the Goree Pass, no one would dare break its sanctity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, be quiet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But we don\u8217\'92t have a choice! We\u8217\'92ve got to keep going!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, another word, and I\u8217\'92m going to get upset.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri is like fuck. A bit humilitating. Watch Purl, bored.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a whole mess of bones over here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone crowded around Purl. At her feet was a jumble of broken leg and arm bones.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Someone\u8217\'92s had a fest,\u8221\'94 said }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moto.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want you and your sister to scout ahead, the whole length of the pass. If there\u8217\'92s people, if there\u8217\'92s an ambush, I want to know about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That will take a few hours.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We need to know what we\u8217\'92re walking into. The rest of us will find a place to keep out of sight, near this spot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I should go too,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Two is enough.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both Moto and Moteah dropped their shimmied out of their packs and Moto pulled out two long sandstone-colored cloaks, tossed one to Moteah, and then they clambered up the southern slope and disappeared from view.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram led the everyone else back east, where he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen a shallow mouth in the base of the northern slope, obscured, in part, by pillar of rock that looked like a giant seed. They all tucked themselves behind this pillar, so that an idle eye of anyone wandering by wouldn\u8217\'92t be able to see them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri settled in for a nice, long wait.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A fluttered flute of a whistle from the path.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram pursed his lips and came .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah rushed in, crouched, her red cloak bunched up at her feet and in a hurried whisper she said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s an ambush. Only a few hundred yards ahead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How many men?\u8221\'94 Ayram whispered back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I Counted twelve. Couldn\u8217\'92t be more than twenty in all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto came stumbling in. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I counted fourteen. It\u8217\'92s an wider valley,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93With a tall slope,\u8221\'94 he flattened his hand in the air to illustrate the incline, nearly plumb. \u8220\'93At the top it\u8217\'92s a vertical wall of rock.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A canyon,\u8221\'94 Moteah clarified.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And at the bottom of this valley, there\u8217\'92s a boulder the size of Minting Rock sitting right in the middle, plugging the gap.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is it impassible?\u8221\'94 Ayram asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a narrow tunnel carved into the bottom, tall enough for a horse. The ambush is set on the other side of this tunnel.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I bet they\u8217\'92ve pushed that boulder down themselves,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sighed and squatted down. His face contorted into a look of pained stress. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s strange is that there\u8217\'92s a man sitting at the tunnel entrance, pretending to be a traveler. At least that\u8217\'92s what I think he\u8217\'92s doing, cause he\u8217\'92s got a traveler\u8217\'92s pack.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s bait,\u8221\'94 said Moteah}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But what do they need bait for?\u8221\'94 Moto asked. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92ve got the ambush set, just spring it! Don\u8217\'92t need to put a man down in the valley where he\u8217\'92s liable to get pricked.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram folded his arms.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Scratched his nose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rubbed his bushy brow with his finger and thumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thirty men, you say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Twenty at most,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I counted fourteen,\u8221\'94 Moto reminded everyone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram drummed his fingers against his chin, then tugged at his bottom lip. He was such a perfect picture of indecision, that Mandri nearly asked for a slip of paper so that he could draw it, and not just Ayram, the scene itself. Sometime nature has a way of organizing itself into a natural composition. Ayram there, standing tall, his head the apex of a pyramid of people, all looking at him for direction, and the weight of their expectations sat heavy on his brow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was Elrahet who broke the edge. Her words a firm encouragement. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We are going through,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They know we\u8217\'92re coming, that much is clear. Still, it is only twenty\u8230\'85 though we\u8217\'92ve only five arrows between us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He turned his cutting eye to Obo and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suppose you\u8217\'92d be any help.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo lit up with astonishment. A cheeky split his lips as he watched everyone watch him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Aren\u8217\'92t I alluring\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Right now, they\u8217\'92re sitting there stewing, wondering why we haven\u8217\'92t shown up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And let me guess, you\u8217\'92re thinking we should all amble right on into that trap, spring it, and when all the little weeds sprout out from behind the rocks, have me deal with them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You killed fifty of my own people in a ravine. In the rain. Surely, with the light of day, you could kill twenty freaks with one flick of your neck.\u8221\'94 }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Walked by Mandri, congenial smile, and said hello to every person in the, and once he got to Ayram he fell into pace, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And how did you get so big? Don\u8217\'92t think I\u8217\'92ve seen a man your size in all my life.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m glad to have stumbled into you folk. To tell the truth, I was too scared to make the pass alone. I heard rumors in that the Goree is a gamble. They say foul creatures inhabit these hills, wearing the form of men.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Looks at Ayram with expectant eyes. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, where are you headed?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Jeket,\u8221\'94 Ayram said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well of course you\u8217\'92re headed to Jeket. Everyone\u8217\'92s headed to Jeket. I\u8217\'92m headed to Jeket myself. Maybe I could take up with you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram glares.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oof, your glare has got a strong Spark. I wonder what it is you do for a living.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I move men who don\u8217\'92t want to be moved.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nodding, really grokking it, missing the point of the threat. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah, you must be a wrestler! Is that what you are? You\u8217\'92re an itinerant wrestler, and this your traveling troupe. You\u8217\'92ve certainly got the size for it. I hear there are big purses in Jeket.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram grunted. Smirked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not a wrestler, then. Well don\u8217\'92t tell me, I\u8217\'92d like to guess. Me? I\u8217\'92m a mercenary, believe it or not. Hired sword for.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put that away.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course, of course. I\u8217\'92d never dream of trying to battle a man your size. I just wanted to show you. It\u8217\'92s basically brand new.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tucks it into his scabbard. Sliced the webbing in his thumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ach!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A little trickle of blood onto the sand swept ground. Tore a from his sleeve and wrapped his hand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Forgive me. I just haven\u8217\'92t seen anyone in a while and when that happens I get excitable. Overstep boundaries, you know. My name is Greskal, by the way.\u8221\'94 He bowed his head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Greskal\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Ayram mused. \u8220\'93Well, Greskal, I think it\u8217\'92s best if we part ways.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Bewildered. Looked east, then west.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How?\u8221\'94 he asked. \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s only the one way, and you don\u8217\'92t own it. Can\u8217\'92t I walk where I please?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can. Just know that as soon as we get out of the pass, I\u8217\'92ll kill you if you\u8217\'92re still in my shadow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll part ways once we leave the pass, okay?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram began again to walk. Greskal followed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s with the dour bunch back here? Are you folks mute, or what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We have nothing to say to you,\u8221\'94 grumbled Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well I\u8217\'92ve some things to say to you,\u8221\'94 Greskal said, impersonating Elrahet\u8217\'92s growl, amusing himself as he did. \u8220\'93Like, isn\u8217\'92t it funny that outside this pass you can kill to your heart\u8217\'92s content, but inside you can\u8217\'92t? Like there\u8217\'92s a magical line in the sand that determines good and evil. Just seems absurd to me. Morality doesn\u8217\'92t depend on where are, right? Like, \u8216\'91Stand here and killing is good, but do it two feet to the left, and Solraheen will damn your Spark to Shis.\u8217\'92 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, \u8220\'93It kinda makes sense to me. Like what if-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri!\u8221\'94 Moto snapped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is he not allowed to talk?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, he\u8217\'92s not,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you allowed to\u8230\'85 What is that!?\u8221\'94 Greskal cried. He was pointing at the swaddled Mazydobo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto answered, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s the boy\u8217\'92s cripple brother.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why\u8217\'92s he all pale like that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A disease of the skin.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t look human.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stopped the line, stepped out, and beckoned Greskal with an impatient finger. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come here,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What for?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because I said come here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look, let\u8217\'92s just keep on walking, shall we? I\u8217\'92ll be quiet, I promise. Just want the safety of numbers, is all. Like I said, there\u8217\'92s creatures out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Cut the shit.\u8221\'94 said Ayram. The menace in his voice was nothing compared to the metallic chinnk of his iron bar thudding against ground.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Cut what shit?\u8221\'94 said Greskal. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell your men to come on out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram pointed behind him with his thumb. High up on the northern ridge was a boulder that looked like a shark\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tooth, and out from behind it, like a weed, poked the wooden limb of a recurved bow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A pregnant silence filled the red-rock valley, then a brusque, unintelligible whisper sounded out from the rocks above, and the wooden bow-tip was tucked out of sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know we can see you, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A snarled retort sprang from unseen heights. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t see shit!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal laughed, then cupped his mouth and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve botched it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A black, turbaned head sprouted up from the boulder above and shouted back, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t botch nothin\u8217\'92! You botched it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal looked to Ayram and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who gave it away, me or him?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you put this show on for every traveler you rob, or is this the first time? I\u8217\'92ll tell you this, two men ain\u8217\'92t going to cut it with me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal sighed, walked over to the southern slope, and dropped his heavy pack. As he stretched his back, he said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your faith in Solraheen must be strong.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You going to kill us, or just take our things?\u8221\'94 Ayram asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think you have the wrong idea,\u8221\'94 said Greskal.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do I?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol\u8217\'92s kin have been flocking eastward of late. So, I devised this plan to sniff them out, you see, they can\u8217\'92t resist easy meat.\u8221\'94 He presented himself with open palms. \u8220\'93I show myself as a lonesome traveler, and when they reveal themselves for the monsters they are, my men riddle them with arrows.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Two men ain\u8217\'92t gonna cut it.\u8221\'94+}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal a shrill whistle that stood the hairs of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck on end. Twenty men rose up on either slope.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Usually works like a charm, but seeing as you have a keen mind, I\u8217\'92m left with a conundrum: how do I know whether or not you\u8217\'92re a demon? Because you sure as shis look like you\u8217\'92ve been feasting on tainted flesh. And that creature on the boy\u8217\'92s back is certainly not natural either.\u8221\'94}
