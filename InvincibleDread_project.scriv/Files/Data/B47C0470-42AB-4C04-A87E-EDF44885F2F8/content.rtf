\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When humanity was young and most were living in dens like lizards, the people who called themselves the Solgruin were building civilization. They built the first canals and the first sustenance fields\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a grid of clean and even rectangles measuring six by one against the banks of the Solket river. They plotted it all out in the first cadastral texts. They domesticated the first plow oxen, grew the first harvests, relished in the first age of plenty, and this was all followed by the first catastrophic drought, and then the first stretch of worn out land, and then came the first law of fallow. This was all a long, long time before rest of Old Jandri toddled to its feet, and it was a time that history would have forgot if not for the fires that burned it all down, for those fires also baked a warehouse that held thousands of scribal tablets whose clay was normally repurposed for practical use. The fire baked those tablets into bricks once and for all, and so an accidental library survived the crumbling ruin. One of the stories that survived the outlasted the centuries was the story of the creation of the Goree Pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One day, Solgruin petitioners went to the temple of Solraheen, for He dwelt among them then, and outside the veil of His bedchamber, they sang their complaint to Him in structured verse\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was proper etiquette to address the Creator with song, even if all you were doing was complaining about how the Goree mountains were too difficult to traverse. The Solgruin were set on the western side of the Goree, and eastern Jandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t far away by land, yet because of the Goree\u8217\'92s impenetrable physique the only way to get there was by boat, a five day journey around the southern horn. The ferrymen charged extortionate prices. It was too great a burden. The song ended by requesting, humbly, for Solraheen to part the mountains and join the two halves of the Jandri world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Solraheen asked why they would want to go to eastern Jandri, the Solgruin said that they wanted to spread His word to the world. The truth was that they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard rumors of gold laying on the ground in eastern Jandri. Naturally, Solraheen saw through their pretensions and denied their request.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A few hundred years later, the Solgruin forgot that Solraheen refused their forebears, and they went to Him a second time to ask, humbly, if He might part the mountains. This generation was more honest in their request, as they made clear their desires were more mundane\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they wanted to walk their caravans into eastern Jandri, that they might trade with the budding cities of Jeket, Shagota, and Zos.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Again, Solraheen denied them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Time passed, the Solket river dwindled, the Solgruin\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s crops began to fail, and worse, Solraheen dwelt there for only one month out of every year. Again, a new generation rose up and went before Him and asked if He might part the mountains.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This third time, Solraheen answered with action. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak one day north of the city, and there he stomped on the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yet the Solgruin did not rejoice, for when Solraheen showed them what he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d done, He said to the them, \u8220\'93Look upon this scar which mars My creation and lament your selfish ways. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, it\u8217\'92s beauty is gone. Cursed are you who pass through it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This story is taught in every Solitant school throughout the Hrkan world because its }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 true}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  lesson is not obvious, and the process of discovering that lesson is meant to be a stepping stone to prepare inquiring minds for the more unintuitive theologies, where common sense and logic will only arrive at the incorrect conclusions. Because it it would seem, on the surface, that the story of the Goree Pass is straightforward\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it warns against humanity\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s self-centeredness. Solraheen created the earth and all its beauty, and then humanity comes along, and in its presumptuous way, said to its Creator, \u8220\'93What you\u8217\'92ve made is great and all, but you know it really would be a lot better if we had a bit more stuff.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s how a child understands the story\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it\u8217\'92s a warning to never put your own desires above Solraheen\u8217\'92s, else you might be cursed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But that understanding was wrong.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Why?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A venerable old priest tried to explain it young Mandri once. He said that Mandri was making a category error, that there is no difference between our desires and Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Our desires are Solraheen\u8217\'92s desires,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93For we are His tools, and a tool is an expression of purpose. Humanity is His tool, one that He uses to shape creation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Another priest put it thus\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93As the desires of the wind shapes the dunes, and the desires of the water shapes the valleys, so too do the desires of humanity shape the rock and clay.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Virtuous desires, corrupting desires\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85Humanity, in Solitant cosmology, is reduced to an impersonal force with more in common with the wind and rain than the mind of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We are the painting, not the painter. We are the subject, not the audience.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And if we are not the intended audience, then it necessarily follows that there is no lesson for us in the story of the Goree pass, or in any story in particular. Yes, our sufferings, our curses, our blessings, this is all an animated drama with profound aesthetic appeal for someone who isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t us. The Goree Pass is not an ugly rent in the mountain range, it is an act in a play, one with a depth of meaning that transcends the capacity for human reason. We are merely tools, after all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This is all a little bit much to lay on a gaggle of ten year olds. But in the end they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re perfectly willing to accept in the end that the Solgruin did nothing wrong, they were only acting in accordance with the script.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen liked the story of the Goree Pass for completely different reasons. There was something special in it for him, because for him, it justified the act of ripping up a painting to spite a client, just as Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d only ever done it once, but what a glorious once it was. He\u8217\'92d spent a week and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he scrapped it because the woman who\u8217\'92d commissioned it said she wouldn\u8217\'92t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting\u8217\'92s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the barbarian King Huldoloon. Th client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn\u8217\'92t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would go to her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a proto-Hrkan Lord on the richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, \u8220\'93That looks just like your Pookum!\u8221\'94, and the woman would say, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s because it is my Pookum!\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri could have tried find a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with resentment, and as his fingers tore the canvas an unfamiliar euphoria coursed through his veins. He tore the painting completely in half, right there in front of that cursed woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voiced pitched up into the hysterics.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is wrong with you!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If Mandri had the power, he would have killed that woman, just as Solraheen killed all those who journeyed the Goree Pass. Well, He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t kill them, He cursed them, and curses, it turns out, does little to dissuade people. After all, here they were, the Ayramun, Mandrameen himself, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 According to Moto, the Greskalun made their home inside the pass itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Either there was no curse and the story was just a story, or maybe the Solitants were right about not taking the surface meaning too seriously. Or, and this is what Moto believed, the curse was only meant for the Solgruin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto gestured grandly to the brightening sky and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How could such a place be cursed?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, further out was the black sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib from spreading out of control. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spite became, for the ground under Mandri\u8217\'92s feet grew uneven, and rocks popped up out of the sand like roots to trip him, and the further south they went, the Goree\u8217\'92s wall grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground. These cracks had long been rubbed smooth, an eon of blasting sand rounding their edges, pillowed the seams, gave the them the appearance of infection. Moto\u8217\'92s bright mood dimmed at the sight of them\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was quite easy to see how someone could call such a place cursed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soon the Goree Pass was sighted in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Ayram informed the rest that this splinter was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the length of the pass and protected against ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now, and had done so for centuries.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering this was a debris field from a mountain pass exploding.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is what rock vomit looks like,\u8221\'94 said Seb. He was walking alongside Mandri and Obo. His gums squelched on a Borcandi spine. \u8220\'93Solraheen punched the gut of the mountain, and the mountain spat these big rocks out. Believe it? Like pissin\u8217\'92 stones.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo, bouncing along in his litter. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have a peculiar talent for imagery, Seb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been indescribable. Would have been unbelievable if it weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t Solraheen who\u8217\'92d done it. He imagined Solraheen standing up there on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his golden rays filtering through the dusty wind, and, well, a god such as He wouldn\u8217\'92t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe for Him to set the fount of creation under the earth to bubbling, the mountains to quaking, and then the earth\u8217\'92s crust would burst open, and exploding out, miles up into the air, were stones the size of houses. A long sliver of the mountain reduced to rubble and spat out\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 vomited out\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 onto the desert plain in the blink of an eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri supposed he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the only one feeling small, for most of the Ayramun walked with reverential backs. This pious bend could be attributed to the weight of their packs and the long journey bearing on them, but the Moteah\u8217\'92s face in particular was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes fretted about the scale of it all. Purl was ashen-faced whispering to herself. There was a spring in Moto\u8217\'92s step, like his feet had found their home. Elrahet was the same as she\u8217\'92d always been\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 angry and grumbling. Meanwhile Seb was chewing his borcandi spines so hard that his jaws were going stiff and he had to rub them. And the man wasn\u8217\'92t paying attention to where he was spitting his juice. Halfway up and over a light scramble over a low shelf of rock, he hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto\u8217\'92s heel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do that again,\u8221\'94 Moto said, \u8220\'93And you\u8217\'92ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb lifted himself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing-up stare. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you disrespect me like that,\u8221\'94 said Seb. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Me disrespect }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 ?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You threaten a man with his kneecaps, that\u8217\'92s disrespectful.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You spit on my foot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was an accident!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And I\u8217\'92m telling you, if you do it again, I\u8217\'92m going to\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quiet!\u8221\'94 Ayram barked. He doubled back to so as make sure he was listened to. He said, \u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t want the Greskalun to think we\u8217\'92re idiots, do we?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both men shook their heads.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No body talks from this point on, except Elrahet. We meet up with the Greskalun, we set a trap for the Hrks in the Pass, and when that\u8217\'92s done, you two can stab each other in the belly as many times as you want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is all that happening today?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If the Hrks are on us, it\u8217\'92ll be today.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s \u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s a shame is that none of that is going to happen today.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can sense the Hrks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but I don\u8217\'92t think its Hrks who pose the biggest threat at the present moment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was quick to answer, like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been waiting for Mandri to ask. \u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t be sure,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet grunted. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The creature seeks to stall us. These is its final hand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you walk right into that pass,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93Then it is almost certainly yours as well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you\u8217\'92ve something to say, then say it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do I get anything out of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Turn Mandri around.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m tired of you Mazyd. I\u8217\'92m tired of the way you act like you know things that I don\u8217\'92t. I know things that you don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not trying to be difficult. As the witch says, these could be my final hands, and I am in obsession of some critical information, and what would I be if I didn\u8217\'92t try to use it for gain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you think me dumb?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. That\u8217\'92s not an insult. A rock is dumb, but that\u8217\'92s what it is, there\u8217\'92s no value judgment here. You lack the necessary equipment to efficiently traverse the landscape of all possible knowledge. A Mazyd is not similarly deprived.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What does that even mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Humans, such as yourselves, have never climbed Mount Nugrush in the badlands, and it\u8217\'92s not for a lack of trying, either. It is simply not something that can be done with hands and feet, or even climbing picks and rope. That inability to summit Nugrush is a consequence of your design, because other creatures, designed differently, can reach it. Birds can reach it. Some species of lizards. This isn\u8217\'92t an indictment on humanity, it\u8217\'92s simply a matter of kind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said no talking.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You also said you didn\u8217\'92t want the Greskalun to think you idiots, but wouldn\u8217\'92t it be better if you weren\u8217\'92t actually an idiot?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are not getting a Spark,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet, matter-of-factly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93At the present moment, no, I\u8217\'92m not, but circumstances are fluid.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ll not be alive by the time night rolls in.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And in the direction we are headed, none of us will be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks won\u8217\'92t stand a chance.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not so much that the Hrks are behind us,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s that the Greskalun aren\u8217\'92t ahead of us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And how could you possibly know that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A preponderance of evidence.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a state between annoyance and disbelief, and Purl\u8217\'92s was steaming in it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It would take too much time for me to recount my reasoning. We\u8217\'92ll upon the pass before long and you\u8217\'92ll see for yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri thought he could hear Purl mulling Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words her head, and that was without even being able to see her, like the cadence of her march was more contemplative.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Eventuality, Purl blurted out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re so full of shit,\u8221\'94 and Mandri had to catch himself from as she stomped past. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He half-whispered to Obo, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you full of shit?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo chuckled to himself, a __ chuckle, almost like a purr, as if he were a cat nestling down in a window-square of sunlight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have I ever lied?\u8221\'94 He asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 said Mandri firmly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t expect me to believe that you\u8217\'92ve never lied.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have wronged, I have deceived, but in all my life, I have never lied.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo, please. In the same breath you admit that you\u8217\'92re deceitful and then you claim you\u8217\'92ve never lied. You can\u8217\'92t do that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was, but Moto had had enough and put a gag on Obo to shut him up.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was this feeling that the Goree was not a living mountain but a dead one, rotted through. The closer to the pass they came, the more the rock around seemed in ruin. That which had once seemed smooth and strong, a bulwark against the wind, was now split into shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. It could hardly be called rock because these shards were as friable as the brittlest shale. They crunched underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against a boulder, his palm punched a dent in it, as if it were nothing but a crust of bread. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was, undoubtedly, a curse on this land, and the Ayramun were fast approaching its source\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the pass itself. The depths of the pass were hidden around a bend, but its presence was there, marked by that black tower poking out into the air like a splinter stuck in a wound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If that tower had a truer name than \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91The Western Tower\u8217\'92, Mandri did not catch it among the nervous whispers of the Ayramun. A had settled in among them, and Mandri as well. He wasn\u8217\'92t worried as much about the Greskalun, he just didn\u8217\'92t like towers. Towers, as a general rule, were evil, for a tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower. Everything else was cover for ill intention, or otherwise monuments to human hubris, and this Tower, black and foreboding as it was, was a particularly striking example of both.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There are certain schools of landscape painters who get paid handsomely to advertise certain places of the world, holy places mostly, holy places near markets that survive on pilgrim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s coin. For a good long while, The Western Tower was one such subject, because if people visited the tower, then mostly came up through old Sisli. So that\u8217\'92s what the tower was in Mandri\u8217\'92s mind, a hollow icon, symbol of greed, a perversion of a perversion, a scene rendered cheaply on kulp wood panels; the needle-like black tower set smack dab in the middle of the pass, though not in the middle of the painting, for the tower is always placed on that crutch for middling artists called the golden third. They do what they can with the sky and clouds, but it\u8217\'92s always a static scene, the black tower and its walls plugging up the pass, and travelers\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 more like a line of ants\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 being forced to pass through the tower\u8217\'92s gate for there\u8217\'92s no other way through. What\u8217\'92s clear is that this tower takes its role as a monument too seriously. It stands there and forces all to reckon with it, a spike of unnatural black in a barren, red land, it doesn\u8217\'92t belong, and that\u8217\'92s the central task of a monument, look like you don\u8217\'92t belong.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Paintings of the Western Tower and its gate are sometime called, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91The Gate of Shis\u8217\'92, though they\u8217\'92re never so haunting. The real approach to the Tower, however, was another matter. The paintings couldn\u8217\'92t capture how the brittle rock slopes threatened to come galloping down upon Mandri every time a lizard stirred from its nook at his approach.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t possible to keep away from the rocks. Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by their invisible Hrkan pursuit. He pioneered a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo without seeing him, but he didn\u8217\'92t ask, he kept quiet because that was the rule.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone kept quiet. Whatever cheer they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d had for making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof that Obo was wrong and that the Greskalun were waiting for them. It went on like this for half a hand, until it all came to halt when they rounded a shale-strewn corner and the Goree pass opened up before them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tall, black stone walls sprawled across the gap. The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle. Unlike the paintings, there weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t any people, no trickle of ants passing into the tower\u8217\'92s mouth, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower\u8217\'92s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners flying hanging on the poles. It seemed, at first take, that Obo was right\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Greskalun were not there.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off towards the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe they all retreated into their sanctuary.\u8221\'94 Seb as was stressed out that he was chewing two spines at once and his words were garbled by a slosh of spit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Retreated from what?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 Seb said defensively.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe it\u8217\'92s a pox,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes went bright with revelation. \u8220\'93That could be it! It\u8217\'92s happened before, right? That\u8217\'92s what they do whenever the pox gets on them, they run back into their sanctuary and stay put \u8216\'91til it all blows over.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s the sign of fire?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked. \u8220\'93If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think we should go in,\u8221\'94 Purl said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s cursed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hogwash,\u8221\'94 said Seb. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You guys know the story about the how the Goree Pass was created, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, we know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wasn\u8217\'92t sure. It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since forever.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It ain\u8217\'92t cursed,\u8221\'94 said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s only cursed if you\u8217\'92re Solgruin.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As if to prove him wrong, a black vulture, which had been sitting in the shadow of the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pointed roof took flight. It spread its wings and soared, caught a thermals and rode it high up into the air, where it wheeled around in circles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s only a bird,\u8221\'94 Ayram muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Two more of vultures melted out of the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow and wheeled up into the air. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri\u8217\'92s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn\u8217\'92t know any better he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen\u8217\'92s ancient curse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo. Moteah said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The place is cursed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if it is? If curses worked, the Hrkan Lords would have choked in their sleep a long, long time ago.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The mood was affecting even Ayram. The strongest men are perhaps the most frightened by magic. A curse of Solraheen was not something he could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion of his control. He marched over to Mandri, and Mandri  fliched, fearing he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d done or said something wrong. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take off you\u8217\'92re pack,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled. Mandri did as he was told and swung Obo\u8217\'92s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it from him and put Obo\u8217\'92s nose right in }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?\u8221\'94 he asked. There was no room in his tone for games.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram growled a hiss and tossed Obo, pack and all, against the ground. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. I know you types abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but all the same, the Hrks didn\u8217\'92t do it. The Goree pass is not yet in sight of the Hrkan Lords.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl snapped at that remark. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everything is in sight of the Lords,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe so,\u8221\'94 Obo sighed. \u8220\'93But I don\u8217\'92t suppose that any of you have an appreciation for how much grain it takes to sustain a fortification of that size? This surrounding area isn\u8217\'92t exactly fertile land, is it? If any of you were students of history, you might know that anytime there\u8217\'92s a drought in the river plain to the south, this tower is the first to feel it. I suspect that\u8217\'92s what\u8217\'92s happened here\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Greskalun began to starve and simply moved on to greener pastures.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet stirred from where she leaned against a boulder. The journey had. Her words came from her throat as if they were not used to them. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gresh\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hghhmmm\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Greskal would not abandon the pass,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93As may be,\u8221\'94 Obo said, \u8220\'93But hunger makes people act out of character.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Greskal\u8217\'92s line has a sacred duty. They would not leave.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo looked at Elrahet with eyes. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you think a person }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  willing to do when hunger sets in?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stepped in. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Greskal and his kin aren\u8217\'92t soft-bellied Hrks. They know hunger. They know suffering.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then you should have no issue accepting that \u8216\'91soft-bellied Hrks\u8217\'92 would never live in a place like this. If there was an extensive system of support, the perhaps\u8230\'85Look, if you are asking me if there are Hrkans waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. But I do think your instincts are correct\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb spat in Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s general direction. The loogie just missed Obo\u8217\'92s litter and splatted harmlessly in the dirt. \u8220\'93Them Greskalun could still be there. Pox, drought, it don\u8217\'92t matter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 when things go bad for them, they go into the mountain. That\u8217\'92s what they do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe,\u8221\'94 said Moteah.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Or maybe not,\u8221\'94 Obo said, suggesting he knew better. Instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter, his elbows stretching his swaddling fabric as he twisted around. Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t help but chuckle at the sight of it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he looked like a toddler all swaddled up in his pack, trying to get comfortable for a nap. With effort, Obo poked the stub of his arm up and out of the neck of his tightly wrapped robe, and he used it to widen the opening so that he could stick his whole arm through. Once done, he reached out behind him and nudged something into view. It was a bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where did you get that?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was sitting here,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93Not the first one I\u8217\'92ve seen. Honestly, I\u8217\'92m surprised you all missed it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo pushed the bone out before him, so that all to see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93Is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb stomped over and nudged it with his toe. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You find one bone and you think them all dead?\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93One bone on the ground? A bone on the ground ain\u8217\'92t unusual. Where else are you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you\u8217\'92d have something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let him speak,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo nudged the bone so that it tipped over. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is an unusual fracture, isn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He rubbed his pale, nubby wrist along the length of the fracture. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a clean fracture, it was a splintered fracture which stretched almost along the whole length of it, leaving the upturned half to look like an open tube.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s broken bone,\u8221\'94 Seb said, unimpressed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that\u8217\'92s how bones naturally break. A break like this\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it\u8217\'92s not likely to happen accidentally.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his probing hands the bone looked like a child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. He said, \u8220\'93If your point is that this person was killed,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93that\u8217\'92s not unusual.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought violence wasn\u8217\'92t allowed in the pass,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re not in the pass,\u8221\'94 Ayram said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But it\u8217\'92s not only that this person was killed,\u8221\'94 said Obo. He pointed to a purplish discoloration nearer the joint. \u8220\'93See this splotch here? This bone is not old.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So what?\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93A recent killing. It doesn\u8217\'92t explain why a thousand Greskalun are missing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It wasn\u8217\'92t simply a killing,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93A blow to the leg would not crack the bone like that. Sure, it could happen, but the chances of that occurring are exceedingly slim.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get on with it,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri site. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating other people. You see, that is the kind of fracture a cannibal makes when he wants open the bone up so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind ran awash with images of an animal man gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat and tendon getting caught in the gaps of his teeth. Ayram seemed to do the same, for he held the bone out away from him as if it were diseased and the thirst for flesh could rub off on him like a plague.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet waddled over and yanked the bone from his grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the thickness of it. She thumbed the open groove, and she held it up to squint inside the open socket. Once satisfied, she dropped the bone onto the sand, right in front of Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This wasn\u8217\'92t the work of man,\u8221\'94 she said, and she was looking up at the rocks behind them as she said it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri followed her gaze but he saw nothing. Was it some strange species of lizard? Was it the vultures? Could a bird break a bone like that?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look!\u8221\'94 shouted Purl. She was pointing towards the tower, and there was Moto, running out of the tower\u8217\'92s gate, running at full speed, frenetic, as if he were being chased, but he was alone with his kicked up dust in the wide mouth of the pass. When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for any questions. He simply said to Ayram, \u8220\'93There is something you need to see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Greskalun?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no Greskalun, that much I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hrks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Forget about the Hrks. There\u8217\'92s something you need to see!\u8221\'94 He looked over his shoulder and grimaced.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pick up the Mazyd\u8221\'94 Ayram said to Mandri, and with that it was decided\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram would lead them all into the Goree Pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At pace they came to the tower and it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gate. The tower seemed sturdy from afar but up close its cobbled self was ancient and bowing every so slightly out. Bricks bulged, some were twisted, some seem to have been pulled halfway out by magic. The get itself was ten-men wide, and it\u8217\'92s arch was fanged by metal teeth which hung ominously above Ayram\u8217\'92s head. The tunnel itself was as large as the hall of the Hrkhale, big enough to send the sound of Ayram\u8217\'92s spud bar thumping against the dirt rushing back at them. Aside from this metronomic beat, they passed through this dark in silence, casting wary glances at each large doorframe that pocketed the arching brickwork, drifts of sand sagging against each frame. Moto in front, a guide. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At the end of the gateway he stopped, just before entering into the pass. He looked back, and a shadow over his face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri felt himself drawn into the. The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick courtyard as old as the tower itself, dusted and grooved by centuries of wagon wheels wearing ruts into it, grooves that  tracked all the way up the gently rising slope and lead into the darkness that was the canyon pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This courtyard was run through with a scattering of wooden poles, each thick as a cow\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly and twice taller than Ayram standing upon himself. They stuck out of the ground like an errant volley of arrows, and wrapped around them were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and exudate. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Desecrations. Cursed heaps of tortured souls. Such was the defilement that the condemnations leaped into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind as readily as the very sight of the profane sculptures themselves. The horror robbed him of the sense of the future, and they sent his stomach into a terrible fit of convulsions.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The nearest wretch was but five yards away\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a man, who, like many, was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant pilgrim. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound his hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, lolling in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore while the broken pottery that was his skull was kept together by nothing but the grace of god.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri knew enough to know that the injuries inflicted on this poor man had special significance. In the darker halls of Hrkan lords there hung portraits of martyrs which made rich use of similar tortures. Mandri never paid them much mind because it was easy to believe that to even look upon such sights was dangerous. And here he was, standing before thirty of them\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 maybe there were fifty\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The only clear statement that Mandri could interpret here, aside from the plain blasphemy of it, lay in the chain wrapped tight around the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t actually see it because the raw skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That was the least of the indignities done to this man. His scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding, though a ring of hair was left to fashion a gleaming madman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s crown. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were filled with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor souls littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo, with the use of his newly freed arm, hauled himself up onto Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder to see for himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, careful that the Ayramun did not hear, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I guess we know what happened to the Greskalun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93These are not the Greskalun,\u8221\'94 Obo whispered back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re not?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93These are pilgrims.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How\u8217\'92d they get like this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d very much like to know myself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl sank to her knees, half in prayer, half in buckling despair. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb, a man who could not stand still, was standing as still as doormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The witch Elrahet must have sensed the presence of such a scene and she had not made it through the tunnel. She was sitting deep inside its shadow and was sitting, hunched, on an inset doorstep. Only the outline of her robe-wrapped knees could be seen against the expanse of the red desert beyond.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever, and the great pack on his shoulders seemed weightless.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said to him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you\u8217\'92d want to see for yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram cast a eye back at his mournful band.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, but I didn\u8217\'92t think he had this in him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His remark startled Seb back into his skin. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who cares if a few god-botherin\u8217\'92 Hrks got what was comin\u8217\'92 to \u8216\'91em? Besides, there\u8217\'92s nothin\u8217\'92 we can do for \u8216\'91em \u8216\'91cause we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And go where?\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We go find the Greskalun!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There are no Greskalun!\u8221\'94 Moteah shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then who did all this?\u8221\'94 Seb asked as he gestured broadly at the carnage. \u8220\'93Greskal ain\u8217\'92t the only man who hates Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain\u8217\'92t one of \u8216\'91em.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before Seb could squeeze in another word, Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moteah\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93Greskal would never do a thing like this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Her echoing voice tickled the backs of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ears. He, like everyone else, spun around and peered dumbly into the darkness of the tunnel after her. Elrahet gave a rattling sigh, she stood up leaning on her walking stick, and where before her verve was waning it was now well and truly gone. She walked towards them all with a hobbling hitch that was not there before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They must have sensed the panic,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It seemed all her joints were aching and lurching. It was as if every long year of her life was suddenly set upon her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not Greskal\u8217\'92s panic, no, that wouldn\u8217\'92t have been enough. The panic of the age\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s what gets their stomachs growling. Always does.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She stepped into the light of courtyard and surveyed the carnage with a hateful glare.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can you sense it, Mazyd? You have sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic? Or have you been swimming in it so long that you can\u8217\'92t tell it\u8217\'92s there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can tell when someone\u8217\'92s pissed themselves, if that\u8217\'92s what you\u8217\'92re asking?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93PANIC!\u8221\'94 she screamed. \u8220\'93Panic sets their stomachs growling. Panic wakes them up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wakes who up?\u8221\'94 Seb asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lip curled to reveal a snaggletooth grin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Demons,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The word zipped past Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ear like an arrow and he felt, somehow, like he\u8217\'92d just dodged another death. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This was demons that did this,\u8221\'94 Elrahet declared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re talking about, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 demon}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  demons?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet spat. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is there any other kind?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wanted to stop himself from saying that there were, indeed, many other kinds. People could be demons, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not an uncommon figure of speech. People could have done this. Or, people infested with demons, that\u8217\'92s not unheard of either. A crowd of the demon possessed could have done this. These explanations satisfied expectations. A }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 demon}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  demon, a }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 real}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  demon, a crowd of them cavorting around on the surface and snatching up innocent Sparks, that was not something he wanted to believe was true. Those demons belonged in children\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stories right next to jokes about fish and poop.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked for holes in the courtyard floor where winged demonic terrors might have come bursting up through brick, but there were none. There was no cackling laughter in the distance, no claw-marks, no hoof-prints. He wanted to point all of this out and demand that Elrahet recant her claim, but what kind of person would he be then, to correct a witch on the matter of demons? So he stayed silent and waited for someone else to take up the challenge. Only Seb shared his questioning look.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ain\u8217\'92t no demons,\u8221\'94 Seb muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb,\u8221\'94 said Moteah, almost unaware of her hostility. \u8220\'93If you don\u8217\'92t think that demons did it, then that\u8217\'92s proof enough that they did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri knew she was right.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram, still the picture of serious contemplation and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll do what we can for them, then we leave.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb raised \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There ain\u8217\'92t nothin\u8217\'92 we can do for \u8216\'91em!\u8221\'94he declared.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93First time in his dumb life, but he\u8217\'92s right. There\u8217\'92s nothing we can do for these people.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Dead is dead,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, they aren\u8217\'92t dead,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked with fresh horror upon the nearest pilgrim, and what he saw was death. Death was becoming a familiar sight for him, and he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen enough to know that humans were fragile things, but this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. Mandri was certain there was no way he could still be alive. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He willed himself to look closer. The man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wounds were quite peculiar. The rubbed raw skin on the outside of his thigh, for example, was no mere abrasion, there white rings of fresh skin circumscribing a freshly festering, leaking scab.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Fresh skin\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Freshly grown\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Well, the flesh might still be alive, but Mandri had seen a chicken running without a head before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He took a step closer, and as he did, the pilgrim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s haircloth habit shuddered.  his head jerked back and his tongue reached out of his open mouth, trying the slightest sip of a breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93MANDRI STOP!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri froze.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The command had come from Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Her knobby finger was pointing at a thin line of blood sprinkled on the ground. It was fresh blood, but not hers or anyone else\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. It was blood that should have seeped into the brick and stained it, or otherwise been lapped up by the sun, and yet there it was, ravishing red, and it ran in a circle around the pilgrim\u8217\'92s pole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The toe of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoe was almost touching it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He jumped back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone was staring at him like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d put that pilgrim up on that pole himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Would that have been bad?\u8221\'94 he asked, pointing at the bloody circle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet, \u8220\'93It would not have been a great loss.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With that she turned and began to hobble back into the tunnel. When no one made an immediate move to follow, she stopped and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We need to leave.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should do what we can for them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We could kill them,\u8221\'94 said Moto. \u8220\'93That would put an end to this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet stopped again and sighed. She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Their very Sparks are bound to the poles. Death, for them, is impossible.\u8221\'94 She stamped her impatience into the ground with her staff and repeated, \u8220\'93We must leave at once.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was the first to follow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hold on,\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re goin\u8217\'92 back!?

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri and obo shared a moment between them.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri felt himself knotting up as Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pale saucer eyes fixed on him. Odd that he should feel this way for so strange a face. Some mothers love children with faces much worse off than Obo\u8217\'92s\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 not that Mandri was feeling something so deep. Obo had had it rough, and that was all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Looked away, like this wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t almost certainly the last he\u8217\'92d ever see of the Mazyd. He couldn\u8217\'92t ignore the budding sense that something was being uncovered here, and as any self-watcher knows, finding things out about oneself is the worst kind of finding. He tried to ignore it. He looked away from Obo, and And he transformed that pang from loss to guilt start to wrap it\u8217\'92s cold hands around him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Right as these thoughts began to coalesce into a monster, Moto yanked the litter right off Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back. Moto had made a makeshift bag for it out of a blanket, and he\u8217\'92d filled that bag it with the stuff that had fallen out of Ayram\u8217\'92s pack\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 skins of water, sticky bars of grain, lumps of something wrapped in linen paper and the like. When Moto handed the litter back to Mandri, it was twice the weight that Obo ever was. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In all this, a small miracle occurred. Seb, in an attempt to reorganize his pack\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s interior to make room for a bundle of dried beef, pulled out a woolen blanket, and in so doing, pulled his bag of burgeons out as well. This burgeon bag hit the ground, and out popped three beautiful God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeons. Two of them spiraled harmlessly in little circles, but one burgeon hit the ground rolling as if flicked towards Mandri\u8217\'92s toes by Solraheen himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri covered it up with his foot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Seb finally noticed that his burgeons had spilled, he snatched them up, quick as a fox, none the wiser that he was short one.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 For Mandri, the feeling of that burgeon under his heel was almost enough to drive away the guilt, almost enough to ignore Obo as the Mazyd was being carried away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri!\u8221\'94 he called, \u8220\'93Never let it be said that I didn\u8217\'92t do anything for these people!\u8221\'94}}
