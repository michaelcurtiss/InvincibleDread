\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram handed Mandri a few strings of jerked beef. It was a morning present to liven his spirits, and this it did with some aplomb, for the beef was spiced with peppercorn and, at some point in it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s humble existence, it had been soaked in a honeyed jelly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It buttered him up, but for what?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you see a man on our journey through the pass, don\u8217\'92t stop and point. Don\u8217\'92t stop walking for any reason, unless I say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram cringed as if Mandri had just spit on his boot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do what I say,\u8221\'94 Ayram said, \u8220\'93and do it without question. Once we\u8217\'92re through the pass, you can piss in the wind all you like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stomped off, his spud bar thudding against the dirt. His enormous pack was already fastened to his shoulders, and as he took off south along the edge of the mountain\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet, and the rest of the Ayramun got up and followed him. Moto stayed behind and gave Mandri a kick.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sighed, popped the last pinch of beef into his mouth, and savored its flavors. He stretched the moment with a beatific smile, and just before Moto was about to kick him again, he stood up, then put Obo in his litter. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As Mandri fitted the straps of Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter onto his back, Moto said, \u8220\'93One thing that Ayram forgot to mention: don\u8217\'92t talk.\u8221\'94 He gave Obo an evil eye and added, \u8220\'93That goes doubly for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But how will I pass the time?\u8221\'94 Obo asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In silence.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you so worried about? You said that every tribe would honor the sanctity of Goree Pass.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not at night. We can\u8217\'92t be found there at night, so we have to get through it in one day, which will be easy enough if you get a move on, Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright, alright.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri set off at a clip to catch up to Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s column.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They walked for an hour in the blue shadow of the mountains, Ayram the mother duck in front, and Moto in the back, with everyone in the middle keeping a tight formation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Twice Mandri clipped Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s heels. The first time she ignored it. The second, she stopped and glared at him. Mandri said sorry and spiced it with a sheepish grin, then added that his legs were too used to flat ground. The rocks here popped up like roots, and it was hard to take his eyes off the massive, swooping, wind-carved edifices that towered to his left. The great bulk of the sandstone had such a smooth, cupped curve, that it looked like a giant red wave rolling into the desert.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As they walked south, the character of the stone changed. It was more fractured, split, and crumbly. The ground was littered with boulders, such that the could no longer follow a straight line, they had to weave up into the scattered of boulders . A maze.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And Mandri wondered when they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d get to the pass, then he saw the sun and realized that they were already in it, for they were walking east. It was a meandering eastern heading, but east nonetheless.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 More open spaces, proper valleys where the Goree sloped up on either side. These valleys were no easy going.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Resting in the middle of this valley was a boulder that was a miniature mountain unto itself. It would have made they way impassable, except carved into it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s base was a narrow tunnel; man-shaped, light at the end. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To the right of the tunnel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s entrance there was a man.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This man was sitting against a pack that was twice his own size. He was dressed in pants that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d bloused into his knee-high boots.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As soon as Ayram neared, this man stood up, spread his arms wide as if to give the universe a hug and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah! Friends!\u8221\'94}
\par\pard\plain \tx0\tx360\tx720\tx1080\tx1440\tx1800\tx2160\tx2880\tx3600\tx4320\fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 None responded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As they neared, Moto jogged up to the front of the line, is pack jingling. He jogged past Ayram, and planted his feet firmly between this strange man and the entrance to the tunnel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hello, friend,\u8221\'94 the man said. He was young, a stubbled chin, perhaps a few years older than Mandri, or perhaps younger. Jandri men sometimes grow beards as young as. His rustic look belied a strength.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram walks right past, the man became dismayed. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Walked by Mandri, congenial smile, and said hello to every person in the, and once he got to Ayram he fell into pace, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And how did you get so big? Don\u8217\'92t think I\u8217\'92ve seen a man your size in all my life.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m glad to have stumbled into you folk. To tell the truth, I was too scared to make the pass alone. I heard rumors in that the Goree is a gamble. They say foul creatures inhabit these hills, wearing the form of men.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Looks at Ayram with expectant eyes. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, where are you headed?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Jeket,\u8221\'94 Ayram said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well of course you\u8217\'92re headed to Jeket. Everyone\u8217\'92s headed to Jeket. I\u8217\'92m headed to Jeket myself. Maybe I could take up with you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram glares.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oof, your glare has got a strong Spark. I wonder what it is you do for a living.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I move men who don\u8217\'92t want to be moved.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nodding, really grokking it, missing the point of the threat. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah, you must be a wrestler! Is that what you are? You\u8217\'92re an itinerant wrestler, and this your traveling troupe. You\u8217\'92ve certainly got the size for it. I hear there are big purses in Jeket.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram grunted. Smirked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not a wrestler, then. Well don\u8217\'92t tell me, I\u8217\'92d like to guess. Me? I\u8217\'92m a mercenary, believe it or not. Hired sword for.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put that away.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course, of course. I\u8217\'92d never dream of trying to battle a man your size. I just wanted to show you. It\u8217\'92s basically brand new.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tucks it into his scabbard. Sliced the webbing in his thumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ach!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A little trickle of blood onto the sand swept ground. Tore a from his sleeve and wrapped his hand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Forgive me. I just haven\u8217\'92t seen anyone in a while and when that happens I get excitable. Overstep boundaries, you know. My name is Greskal, by the way.\u8221\'94 He bowed his head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Greskal\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 Ayram mused. \u8220\'93Well, Greskal, I think it\u8217\'92s best if we part ways.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Bewildered. Looked east, then west.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How?\u8221\'94 he asked. \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s only the one way, and you don\u8217\'92t own it. Can\u8217\'92t I walk where I please?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can. Just know that as soon as we get out of the pass, I\u8217\'92ll kill you if you\u8217\'92re still in my shadow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll part ways once we leave the pass, okay?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram began again to walk. Greskal followed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s with the dour bunch back here? Are you folks mute, or what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We have nothing to say to you,\u8221\'94 grumbled Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well I\u8217\'92ve some things to say to you,\u8221\'94 Greskal said, impersonating Elrahet\u8217\'92s growl, amusing himself as he did. \u8220\'93Like, isn\u8217\'92t it funny that outside this pass you can kill to your heart\u8217\'92s content, but inside you can\u8217\'92t? Like there\u8217\'92s a magical line in the sand that determines good and evil. Just seems absurd to me. Morality doesn\u8217\'92t depend on where are, right? Like, \u8216\'91Stand here and killing is good, but do it two feet to the left, and Solraheen will damn your Spark to Shis.\u8217\'92 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 Mandri said, \u8220\'93It kinda makes sense to me. Like what if-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri!\u8221\'94 Moto snapped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is he not allowed to talk?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, he\u8217\'92s not,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why are you allowed to\u8230\'85 What is that!?\u8221\'94 Greskal cried. He was pointing at the swaddled Mazydobo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto answered, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s the boy\u8217\'92s cripple brother.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why\u8217\'92s he all pale like that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A disease of the skin.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t look human.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stopped the line, stepped out, and beckoned Greskal with an impatient finger. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come here,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What for?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because I said come here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look, let\u8217\'92s just keep on walking, shall we? I\u8217\'92ll be quiet, I promise. Just want the safety of numbers, is all. Like I said, there\u8217\'92s creatures out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Cut the shit.\u8221\'94 said Ayram. The menace in his voice was nothing compared to the metallic chinnk of his iron bar thudding against ground.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Cut what shit?\u8221\'94 said Greskal. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell your men to come on out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram pointed behind him with his thumb. High up on the northern ridge was a boulder that looked like a shark\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tooth, and out from behind it, like a weed, poked the wooden limb of a recurved bow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A pregnant silence filled the red-rock valley, then a brusque, unintelligible whisper sounded out from the rocks above, and the wooden bow-tip was tucked out of sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know we can see you, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A snarled retort sprang from unseen heights. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t see shit!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal laughed, then cupped his mouth and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve botched it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A black, turbaned head sprouted up from the boulder above and shouted back, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t botch nothin\u8217\'92! You botched it!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal looked to Ayram and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who gave it away, me or him?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you put this show on for every traveler you rob, or is this the first time? I\u8217\'92ll tell you this, two men ain\u8217\'92t going to cut it with me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal sighed, walked over to the southern slope, and dropped his heavy pack. As he stretched his back, he said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your faith in Solraheen must be strong.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You going to kill us, or just take our things?\u8221\'94 Ayram asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think you have the wrong idea,\u8221\'94 said Greskal.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do I?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Schisol\u8217\'92s kin have been flocking eastward of late. So, I devised this plan to sniff them out, you see, they can\u8217\'92t resist easy meat.\u8221\'94 He presented himself with open palms. \u8220\'93I show myself as a lonesome traveler, and when they reveal themselves for the monsters they are, my men riddle them with arrows.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Two men ain\u8217\'92t gonna cut it.\u8221\'94+}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal a shrill whistle that stood the hairs of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck on end. Twenty men rose up on either slope.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Usually works like a charm, but seeing as you have a keen mind, I\u8217\'92m left with a conundrum: how do I know whether or not you\u8217\'92re a demon? Because you sure as shis look like you\u8217\'92ve been feasting on tainted flesh. And that creature on the boy\u8217\'92s back is certainly not natural either.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri felt Obo stir in the litter.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What tribe are you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kalemun. And you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ayramun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I take it you are Ayram?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, Ayram, I\u8217\'92m afraid I\u8217\'92m going to have to make you do something that you don\u8217\'92t want to do. I can\u8217\'92t let you through the pass. You\u8217\'92re going to have to return east.\u8221\'94}
