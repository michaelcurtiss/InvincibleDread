\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When humanity was young and most were living in dens like lizards, the people who called themselves the Solgruin were building civilization. They built the first canals and the first sustenance fields\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a grid of clean and even rectangles measuring six by one against the banks of the Solket river. They plotted it all out in the first cadastral texts. They domesticated the first plow oxen, grew the first harvests, relished in the first age of plenty, and this was all followed by the first catastrophic drought, and then the first stretch of worn out land, and then came the first law of fallow. This was all a long, long time before rest of Old Jandri toddled to its feet, and it was a time that history would have forgot if not for the fires that burned it all down, for those fires also baked a warehouse that held thousands of scribal tablets whose clay was normally repurposed for practical use. The fire baked those tablets into bricks once and for all, and so an accidental library survived the crumbling ruin. One of the stories that survived the outlasted the centuries was the story of the creation of the Goree Pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One day, Solgruin petitioners went to the temple of Solraheen, for He dwelt among them then, and outside the veil of His bedchamber, they sang their complaint to Him in structured verse\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was proper etiquette to address the Creator with song, even if all you were doing was complaining about how the Goree mountains were too difficult to traverse. The Solgruin were set on the western side of the Goree, and eastern Jandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t far away by land, yet because of the Goree\u8217\'92s impenetrable physique the only way to get there was by boat, a five day journey around the southern horn. The ferrymen charged extortionate prices. It was too great a burden. The song ended by requesting, humbly, for Solraheen to part the mountains and join the two halves of the Jandri world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Solraheen asked why they would want to go to eastern Jandri, the Solgruin said that they wanted to spread His word to the world. The truth was that they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard rumors of gold laying on the ground in eastern Jandri. Naturally, Solraheen saw through their pretensions and denied their request.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A few hundred years later, the Solgruin forgot that Solraheen refused their forebears, and they went to Him a second time to ask, humbly, if He might part the mountains. This generation was more honest in their request, as they made clear their desires were more mundane\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they wanted to walk their caravans into eastern Jandri, that they might trade with the budding cities of Jeket, Shagota, and Zos.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Again, Solraheen denied them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Time passed, the Solket river dwindled, the Solgruin\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s crops began to fail, and worse, Solraheen dwelt there for only one month out of every year. Again, a new generation rose up and went before Him and asked if He might part the mountains.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This third time, Solraheen answered with action. He walked to the mountains, climbed the tallest peak one day north of the city, and there he stomped on the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back and broke it. A great fissure opened up in the earth, making the way traversable.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yet the Solgruin did not rejoice, for when Solraheen showed them what he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d done, He said to the them, \u8220\'93Look upon this scar which mars My creation and lament your selfish ways. This mountain impeded your comings and goings, and so you sought to destroy it. Now, it is destroyed, it\u8217\'92s beauty is gone. Cursed are you who pass through it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This story is taught in every Solitant school throughout the Hrkan world because its }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 true}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  lesson is not obvious, and the process of discovering that lesson is meant to be a stepping stone to prepare inquiring minds for the more unintuitive theologies, where common sense and logic will only arrive at the incorrect conclusions. Because it it would seem, on the surface, that the story of the Goree Pass is straightforward\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it warns against humanity\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s self-centeredness. Solraheen created the earth and all its beauty, and then humanity comes along, and in its presumptuous way, said to its Creator, \u8220\'93What you\u8217\'92ve made is great and all, but you know it really would be a lot better if we had a bit more stuff.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s how a child understands the story\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it\u8217\'92s a warning to never put your own desires above Solraheen\u8217\'92s, else you might be cursed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But that understanding was wrong.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Why?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A venerable old priest tried to explain it young Mandri once. He said that Mandri was making a category error, that there is no difference between our desires and Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Our desires are Solraheen\u8217\'92s desires,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93For we are His tools, and a tool is an expression of purpose. Humanity is His tool, one that He uses to shape creation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Another priest put it thus\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93As the desires of the wind shapes the dunes, and the desires of the water shapes the valleys, so too do the desires of humanity shape the rock and clay.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Virtuous desires, corrupting desires\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85Humanity, in Solitant cosmology, is reduced to an impersonal force with more in common with the wind and rain than the mind of Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We are the painting, not the painter. We are the subject, not the audience.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And if we are not the intended audience, then it necessarily follows that there is no lesson for us in the story of the Goree pass, or in any story in particular. Yes, our sufferings, our curses, our blessings, this is all an animated drama with profound aesthetic appeal for someone who isn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t us. The Goree Pass is not an ugly rent in the mountain range, it is an act in a play, one with a depth of meaning that transcends the capacity for human reason. We are merely tools, after all.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This is all a little bit much to lay on a gaggle of ten year olds. But in the end they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re perfectly willing to accept in the end that the Solgruin did nothing wrong, they were only acting in accordance with the script.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen liked the story of the Goree Pass for completely different reasons. There was something special in it for him, because for him, it justified the act of ripping up a painting to spite a client, just as Solraheen ripped up the Goree to spite the Solgruin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d only ever done it once, but what a glorious once it was. He\u8217\'92d spent a week and a small fortune painting this particular painting, and he scrapped it because the woman who\u8217\'92d commissioned it said she wouldn\u8217\'92t pay unless he put a dog in the foreground shadow. The painting\u8217\'92s subject was the rape of Belsurnag, set in the receiving room of the barbarian King Huldoloon. Th client wanted Mandri to put a smiling dog in the foreground. This wasn\u8217\'92t some clever metaphorical bent, she wanted Mandrameen to paint her own, small, shaggy lapdog as a kind of private aside, a conversation starter, so that when people would go to her house and see the beautiful Belsurnag being ravaged by a proto-Hrkan Lord on the richly patterned carpet, their eyes would stumble over the brown, shaggy creature sitting there on a lacquered chair and say, \u8220\'93That looks just like your Pookum!\u8221\'94, and the woman would say, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s because it is my Pookum!\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri could have tried find a different buyer, but in the moment he was overcome with resentment, and as his fingers tore the canvas an unfamiliar euphoria coursed through his veins. He tore the painting completely in half, right there in front of that cursed woman. The shock and horror on her face was cathartic. Then came her anger. Her voiced pitched up into the hysterics.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is wrong with you!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If Mandri had the power, he would have killed that woman, just as Solraheen killed all those who journeyed the Goree Pass. Well, He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t kill them, He cursed them, and curses, it turns out, does little to dissuade people. After all, here they were, the Ayramun, Mandrameen himself, venturing south in the cold morning shadow of the Goree mountains, headed for the pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 According to Moto, the Greskalun made their home inside the pass itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Either there was no curse and the story was just a story, or maybe the Solitants were right about not taking the surface meaning too seriously. Or, and this is what Moto believed, the curse was only meant for the Solgruin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto gestured grandly to the brightening sky and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How could such a place be cursed?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Aside from the morning chill, it was clean, easy going. To the right was the open desert, further out was the black sea that was the Tib. To the left were the Goree mountains, though they weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t really mountains in the traditional sense, they were smooth, swooping, terraced walls of red sandstone, a thousand staggered plateaus looking like squat redoubts, each a link in a continental fortress built by Solraheen to hold back the Tib from spreading out of control. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The further south they walked, the clearer Solraheen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spite became, for the ground under Mandri\u8217\'92s feet grew uneven, and rocks popped up out of the sand like roots to trip him, and the further south they went, the Goree\u8217\'92s wall grew more worn and pitted, and soon, there were jagged, fern-like cracks which radiated up from the ground. These cracks had long been rubbed smooth, an eon of blasting sand rounding their edges, pillowed the seams, gave the them the appearance of infection. Moto\u8217\'92s bright mood dimmed at the sight of them\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it was quite easy to see how someone could call such a place cursed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soon the Goree Pass was sighted in the distant south. It was a dark and sloping cut in the face of the Goree\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall. A black splinter poked up out of it, and Ayram informed the rest that this splinter was a tower, a central column in an ancient fortification which spanned the length of the pass and protected against ancient evils. The Greskalun lived in it now, and had done so for centuries.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram led them straight for it, or as straight a path as he could manage considering this was a debris field from a mountain pass exploding.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is what rock vomit looks like,\u8221\'94 said Seb. He was walking alongside Mandri and Obo. His gums squelched on a Borcandi spine. \u8220\'93Solraheen punched the gut of the mountain, and the mountain spat these big rocks out. Believe it? Like pissin\u8217\'92 stones.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo, bouncing along in his litter. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have a peculiar talent for imagery, Seb.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scattered boulders were a disquieting sight. The amount of power needed to lift them up, let alone toss them this far out would have been indescribable. Would have been unbelievable if it weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t Solraheen who\u8217\'92d done it. He imagined Solraheen standing up there on the tallest plateau, His figure a radiant white speck outshining the sun, his golden rays filtering through the dusty wind, and, well, a god such as He wouldn\u8217\'92t need to strike the earth to split it, it would be enough for Him to stamp His intention into the dirt, and the rest of creation would manifest His will. All it would take is a tap of the toe for Him to set the fount of creation under the earth to bubbling, the mountains to quaking, and then the earth\u8217\'92s crust would burst open, and exploding out, miles up into the air, were stones the size of houses. A long sliver of the mountain reduced to rubble and spat out\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 vomited out\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 onto the desert plain in the blink of an eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri supposed he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the only one feeling small, for most of the Ayramun walked with reverential backs. This pious bend could be attributed to the weight of their packs and the long journey bearing on them, but the Moteah\u8217\'92s face in particular was alight in anxious wonder as her eyes fretted about the scale of it all. Purl was ashen-faced whispering to herself. There was a spring in Moto\u8217\'92s step, like his feet had found their home. Elrahet was the same as she\u8217\'92d always been\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 angry and grumbling. Meanwhile Seb was chewing his borcandi spines so hard that his jaws were going stiff and he had to rub them. And the man wasn\u8217\'92t paying attention to where he was spitting his juice. Halfway up and over a light scramble over a low shelf of rock, he hocked a particularly dreadful wad of spit onto Moto\u8217\'92s heel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do that again,\u8221\'94 Moto said, \u8220\'93And you\u8217\'92ll be scraping your face off a rock with your kneecaps.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb lifted himself up onto even ground. The two shared a long, sizing-up stare. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you disrespect me like that,\u8221\'94 said Seb. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Me disrespect }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 you}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 ?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You threaten a man with his kneecaps, that\u8217\'92s disrespectful.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You spit on my foot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was an accident!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And I\u8217\'92m telling you, if you do it again, I\u8217\'92m going to\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quiet!\u8221\'94 Ayram barked. He doubled back to so as make sure he was listened to. He said, \u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t want the Greskalun to think we\u8217\'92re idiots, do we?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both men shook their heads.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No body talks from this point on, except Elrahet. We meet up with the Greskalun, we set a trap for the Hrks in the Pass, and when that\u8217\'92s done, you two can stab each other in the belly as many times as you want.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is all that happening today?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If the Hrks are on us, it\u8217\'92ll be today.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s \u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s a shame is that none of that is going to happen today.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can sense the Hrks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but I don\u8217\'92t think its Hrks who pose the biggest threat at the present moment.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was quick to answer, like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been waiting for Mandri to ask. \u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t be sure,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet grunted. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The creature seeks to stall us. These is its final hand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you walk right into that pass,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93Then it is almost certainly yours as well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you\u8217\'92ve something to say, then say it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do I get anything out of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Turn Mandri around.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m tired of you Mazyd. I\u8217\'92m tired of the way you act like you know things that I don\u8217\'92t. I know things that you don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not trying to be difficult. As the witch says, these could be my final hands, and I am in obsession of some critical information, and what would I be if I didn\u8217\'92t try to use it for gain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you think me dumb?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. That\u8217\'92s not an insult. A rock is dumb, but that\u8217\'92s what it is, there\u8217\'92s no value judgment here. You lack the necessary equipment to efficiently traverse the landscape of all possible knowledge. A Mazyd is not similarly deprived.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What does that even mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Humans, such as yourselves, have never climbed Mount Nugrush in the badlands, and it\u8217\'92s not for a lack of trying, either. It is simply not something that can be done with hands and feet, or even climbing picks and rope. That inability to summit Nugrush is a consequence of your design, because other creatures, designed differently, can reach it. Birds can reach it. Some species of lizards. This isn\u8217\'92t an indictment on humanity, it\u8217\'92s simply a matter of kind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said no talking.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You also said you didn\u8217\'92t want the Greskalun to think you idiots, but wouldn\u8217\'92t it be better if you weren\u8217\'92t actually an idiot?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are not getting a Spark,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet, matter-of-factly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93At the present moment, no, I\u8217\'92m not, but circumstances are fluid.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ll not be alive by the time night rolls in.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And in the direction we are headed, none of us will be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks won\u8217\'92t stand a chance.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not so much that the Hrks are behind us,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s that the Greskalun aren\u8217\'92t ahead of us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And how could you possibly know that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A preponderance of evidence.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a state between annoyance and disbelief, and Purl\u8217\'92s was steaming in it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It would take too much time for me to recount my reasoning. We\u8217\'92ll upon the pass before long and you\u8217\'92ll see for yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri thought he could hear Purl mulling Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words her head, and that was without even being able to see her, like the cadence of her march was more contemplative.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Eventuality, Purl blurted out, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re so full of shit,\u8221\'94 and Mandri had to catch himself from as she stomped past. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He half-whispered to Obo, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you full of shit?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo chuckled to himself, a __ chuckle, almost like a purr, as if he were a cat nestling down in a window-square of sunlight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have I ever lied?\u8221\'94 He asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 said Mandri firmly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t expect me to believe that you\u8217\'92ve never lied.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have wronged, I have deceived, but in all my life, I have never lied.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo, please. In the same breath you admit that you\u8217\'92re deceitful and then you claim you\u8217\'92ve never lied. You can\u8217\'92t do that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was, but Moto had had enough and put a gag on Obo to shut him up.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was this feeling that the Goree was not a living mountain but a dead one, rotted through. The closer to the pass they came, the more the rock around seemed in ruin. That which had once seemed smooth and strong, a bulwark against the wind, was now split into shards and scattered about like the leavings of flies beside a carcass. It could hardly be called rock because these shards were as friable as the brittlest shale. They crunched underfoot, and the larger stones were as diseased\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 when Mandri set his hand to brace himself against a boulder, his palm punched a dent in it, as if it were nothing but a crust of bread. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was, undoubtedly, a curse on this land, and the Ayramun were fast approaching its source\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the pass itself. The depths of the pass were hidden around a bend, but its presence was there, marked by that black tower poking out into the air like a splinter stuck in a wound.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If that tower had a truer name than \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91The Western Tower\u8217\'92, Mandri did not catch it among the nervous whispers of the Ayramun. A had settled in among them, and Mandri as well. He wasn\u8217\'92t worried as much about the Greskalun, he just didn\u8217\'92t like towers. Towers, as a general rule, were evil, for a tower could be built of the purest marble and haloed by the sun, but there was always the question of what someone could be doing to warrant such elevated privacy\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 nothing good. A short, makeshift wooden watchtower on tribal frontiers was the only legitimate use of a tower. Everything else was cover for ill intention, or otherwise monuments to human hubris, and this Tower, black and foreboding as it was, was a particularly striking example of both.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There are certain schools of landscape painters who get paid handsomely to advertise certain places of the world, holy places mostly, holy places near markets that survive on pilgrim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s coin. For a good long while, The Western Tower was one such subject, because if people visited the tower, then mostly came up through old Sisli. So that\u8217\'92s what the tower was in Mandri\u8217\'92s mind, a hollow icon, symbol of greed, a perversion of a perversion, a scene rendered cheaply on kulp wood panels; the needle-like black tower set smack dab in the middle of the pass, though not in the middle of the painting, for the tower is always placed on that crutch for middling artists called the golden third. They do what they can with the sky and clouds, but it\u8217\'92s always a static scene, the black tower and its walls plugging up the pass, and travelers\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 more like a line of ants\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 being forced to pass through the tower\u8217\'92s gate for there\u8217\'92s no other way through. What\u8217\'92s clear is that this tower takes its role as a monument too seriously. It stands there and forces all to reckon with it, a spike of unnatural black in a barren, red land, it doesn\u8217\'92t belong, and that\u8217\'92s the central task of a monument, look like you don\u8217\'92t belong.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Paintings of the Western Tower and its gate are sometime called, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91The Gate of Shis\u8217\'92, though they\u8217\'92re never so haunting. The real approach to the Tower, however, was another matter. The paintings couldn\u8217\'92t capture how the brittle rock slopes threatened to come galloping down upon Mandri every time a lizard stirred from its nook at his approach.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t possible to keep away from the rocks. Ayram was too concerned with not being seen by their invisible Hrkan pursuit. He pioneered a course that led up into these crumbling mounds. Mandri wondered why keeping out of sight mattered if the Hrks could track Obo without seeing him, but he didn\u8217\'92t ask, he kept quiet because that was the rule.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone kept quiet. Whatever cheer they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d had for making it out of the Tib was well and truly gone. All eyes and ears were preoccupied with finding proof that Obo was wrong and that the Greskalun were waiting for them. It went on like this for half a hand, until it all came to halt when they rounded a shale-strewn corner and the Goree pass opened up before them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tall, black stone walls sprawled across the gap. The great tower stood proudly, right in the middle. Unlike the paintings, there weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t any people, no trickle of ants passing into the tower\u8217\'92s mouth, though the gate was wide open. There were no lights in the tower\u8217\'92s windows. There were no heads peeking over the walls. There were no banners flying hanging on the poles. It seemed, at first take, that Obo was right\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Greskalun were not there.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram summoned Moto with a brusque jerk of his bearded chin. A few whispered instructions later, and Moto climbed down onto the road proper and hustled off towards the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow, hand clasping his scabbard.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe they all retreated into their sanctuary.\u8221\'94 Seb as was stressed out that he was chewing two spines at once and his words were garbled by a slosh of spit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Retreated from what?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 Seb said defensively.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe it\u8217\'92s a pox,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes went bright with revelation. \u8220\'93That could be it! It\u8217\'92s happened before, right? That\u8217\'92s what they do whenever the pox gets on them, they run back into their sanctuary and stay put \u8216\'91til it all blows over.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92s the sign of fire?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked. \u8220\'93If it was the pox, they would have burned everything they could, not carried it off.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think we should go in,\u8221\'94 Purl said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s cursed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hogwash,\u8221\'94 said Seb. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You guys know the story about the how the Goree Pass was created, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, we know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I wasn\u8217\'92t sure. It just seems plainly obvious to me that this place is cursed, and has been since forever.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It ain\u8217\'92t cursed,\u8221\'94 said Ayram with all the certainty of a big man who knows. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s only cursed if you\u8217\'92re Solgruin.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As if to prove him wrong, a black vulture, which had been sitting in the shadow of the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pointed roof took flight. It spread its wings and soared, caught a thermals and rode it high up into the air, where it wheeled around in circles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s only a bird,\u8221\'94 Ayram muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Two more of vultures melted out of the tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow and wheeled up into the air. Their wheezing screeches filtered down through the distance to reach Mandri\u8217\'92s ears like hissing whispers. If he didn\u8217\'92t know any better he would have thought it was the haggard voices of the rocks echoing Solraheen\u8217\'92s ancient curse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo. Moteah said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The place is cursed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What if it is? If curses worked, the Hrkan Lords would have choked in their sleep a long, long time ago.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The mood was affecting even Ayram. The strongest men are perhaps the most frightened by magic. A curse of Solraheen was not something he could kill with a spear. And now that the Greskalun were missing, so was the illusion of his control. He marched over to Mandri, and Mandri  fliched, fearing he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d done or said something wrong. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take off you\u8217\'92re pack,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled. Mandri did as he was told and swung Obo\u8217\'92s litter off his shoulders. Ayram grabbed it from him and put Obo\u8217\'92s nose right in }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did the Hrks kill the Greskalun?\u8221\'94 he asked. There was no room in his tone for games.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram growled a hiss and tossed Obo, pack and all, against the ground. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You should stop blaming the Hrkan world for all your problems. I know you types abhor personal responsibility, but really, there comes a point when\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Hrks are the only ones who could have pushed the Greskalun out of that tower.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but all the same, the Hrks didn\u8217\'92t do it. The Goree pass is not yet in sight of the Hrkan Lords.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl snapped at that remark. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everything is in sight of the Lords,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe so,\u8221\'94 Obo sighed. \u8220\'93But I don\u8217\'92t suppose that any of you have an appreciation for how much grain it takes to sustain a fortification of that size? This surrounding area isn\u8217\'92t exactly fertile land, is it? If any of you were students of history, you might know that anytime there\u8217\'92s a drought in the river plain to the south, this tower is the first to feel it. I suspect that\u8217\'92s what\u8217\'92s happened here\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Greskalun began to starve and simply moved on to greener pastures.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet stirred from where she leaned against a boulder. The journey had. Her words came from her throat as if they were not used to them. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gresh\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 hghhmmm\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Greskal would not abandon the pass,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93As may be,\u8221\'94 Obo said, \u8220\'93But hunger makes people act out of character.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Greskal\u8217\'92s line has a sacred duty. They would not leave.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo looked at Elrahet with eyes. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do you think a person }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  willing to do when hunger sets in?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stepped in. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Greskal and his kin aren\u8217\'92t soft-bellied Hrks. They know hunger. They know suffering.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then you should have no issue accepting that \u8216\'91soft-bellied Hrks\u8217\'92 would never live in a place like this. If there was an extensive system of support, the perhaps\u8230\'85Look, if you are asking me if there are Hrkans waiting behind those walls to ambush you as soon as you step through that gate, I can say with certainty that they are not there. But I do think your instincts are correct\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 what lies behind those walls is not something we should wish to encounter.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb spat in Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s general direction. The loogie just missed Obo\u8217\'92s litter and splatted harmlessly in the dirt. \u8220\'93Them Greskalun could still be there. Pox, drought, it don\u8217\'92t matter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 when things go bad for them, they go into the mountain. That\u8217\'92s what they do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe,\u8221\'94 said Moteah.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Or maybe not,\u8221\'94 Obo said, suggesting he knew better. Instead of explaining, he wriggled around in his litter, his elbows stretching his swaddling fabric as he twisted around. Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t help but chuckle at the sight of it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he looked like a toddler all swaddled up in his pack, trying to get comfortable for a nap. With effort, Obo poked the stub of his arm up and out of the neck of his tightly wrapped robe, and he used it to widen the opening so that he could stick his whole arm through. Once done, he reached out behind him and nudged something into view. It was a bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where did you get that?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was sitting here,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93Not the first one I\u8217\'92ve seen. Honestly, I\u8217\'92m surprised you all missed it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo pushed the bone out before him, so that all to see. It was the upper half of a leg bone, ball-jointed, broken roughly in the middle, distinctively human.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93Is a clue to the fate of your Greskalun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb stomped over and nudged it with his toe. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You find one bone and you think them all dead?\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93One bone on the ground? A bone on the ground ain\u8217\'92t unusual. Where else are you expecting to find a bone? Find it floating in the air and maybe you\u8217\'92d have something.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let him speak,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo nudged the bone so that it tipped over. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is an unusual fracture, isn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He rubbed his pale, nubby wrist along the length of the fracture. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a clean fracture, it was a splintered fracture which stretched almost along the whole length of it, leaving the upturned half to look like an open tube.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s broken bone,\u8221\'94 Seb said, unimpressed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Breaking a bone lengthwise like this is not easy. If it were snapped in two like a dry twig, that\u8217\'92s how bones naturally break. A break like this\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it\u8217\'92s not likely to happen accidentally.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram reached down and picked it up. In his probing hands the bone looked like a child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. He said, \u8220\'93If your point is that this person was killed,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93that\u8217\'92s not unusual.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought violence wasn\u8217\'92t allowed in the pass,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re not in the pass,\u8221\'94 Ayram said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But it\u8217\'92s not only that this person was killed,\u8221\'94 said Obo. He pointed to a purplish discoloration nearer the joint. \u8220\'93See this splotch here? This bone is not old.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So what?\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93A recent killing. It doesn\u8217\'92t explain why a thousand Greskalun are missing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It wasn\u8217\'92t simply a killing,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93A blow to the leg would not crack the bone like that. Sure, it could happen, but the chances of that occurring are exceedingly slim.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get on with it,\u8221\'94 Ayram grumbled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri site. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating other people.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram turned the bone around with a bit more care.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You see, that is the kind of fracture a cannibal makes when he wants open the bone up like a treasure chest so that he can gnaw on the spongy marrow inside.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind ran awash with images of an animal man gnawing on that bone as if it were an ear of corn, with strings of fat getting caught in the gaps of his teeth. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet stomped over and took the bone from Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grip. She tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of her finger, and her eyes narrowed at the. She turned the whole thing over in her hands, thumbed a groove with some contemplation, then handed the bone right back. She and Ayram shared a look, and the two in unison turned their backs on the others and marched off to where they could share words unheard.}

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They did not have to wait long. Almost as soon as he spoke the words, Moto came running out of the Tower\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mouth. He ran with, almost as if he were being chased, but nothing pursued\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 nothing that they could see. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he arrived, breathless and wild-eyed, he did not wait for any questions. He simply said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s something you need to see.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Greskalun?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He shook his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no Greskalun. That much I know. You need to see it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And the Hrks?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Forget about the Hrks. There\u8217\'92s something you need to see!\u8221\'94 He looked over his shoulder and grimaced.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram cast a glance aside at Elrahet, and old witch nodded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pick up the Mazyd\u8221\'94 he said to Mandri, and thus he led them down into the pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At pace they came to the tower and it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gate. Cobbled nature, ancient, leaning just so, Mandri looked up, and from this sharp angle he could see how the tall tower didn\u8217\'92t quite go straight up, the carpet of it\u8217\'92s bricks bulged, twisted, and leaned forward ever so slightly, come crashing down on him. And then there was the arch of the gate, by the gate\u8217\'92s long metal teeth which hung ominously above Ayram\u8217\'92s head. The tunnel itself was as large as the hall of the Hrkhale, big enough to send the sound of Ayram\u8217\'92s spud bar thumping against the dirt rushing back at them. Aside from this metronomic beat, they passed through this dark in silence, casting wary glances at each large doorframe that pocketed the arching brickwork, drifts of sand sagging against each frame. Moto in front, a guide. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stops.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Looks back, shadow over his face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The tunnel emptied out into a broad, pale-brick courtyard as old as the tower itself, dusted and with centuries of wagon of wagon traffic wearing wheel ruts into road, tracking all the way up the gently rising slope that lead into the darkness of the canyoned pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In this courtyard was a haphazard scattering of wooden poles, each thick as a cow\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly and taller than,  sticking out of the ground like an errant volley of arrows. Wrapped around these poles were the bodies of men and women so brutalized that their forms blurred the lines between flesh, blood, and seeping exudate. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Desecrations, all of them. Cursed heaps of tortured souls. Such was the defilement that the condemnations leaped into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind as readily as the very sight of the profane sculptures themselves, which themselves were so present that Mandri\u8217\'92s stomach into fits of convulsion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The nearest was but five yards away - a man, who, like many, was robed in the tatters of the honeyed yellow haircloth habit of a devout Solitant. Honeyed yellow, the color of peace and unassumption. A rope of thorns bound the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hip and chest tight to the pole, leaving his mangled limbs dangling in the air, and his pulped face, bloated and boneless, was stuck in an open-mouthed, buck-toothed snore as the broken pottery that was his skull seemed kept together by the grace of god.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri knew enough to know that the injuries inflicted on this poor man had some special significance. In the darker halls of Hrkan lords there hung portraits of martyrs which made rich use of similar tortures. Mandri never paid them much mind because the common consensus was that to even look upon such sights was dangerous. And here he was, standing before thirty of them - maybe there were fifty - to count would require the use of reason and reason had abandoned this place.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The only clear statement that Mandri could interpret here, aside from the plain blasphemy of it, lay in the chain wrapped tight around the man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck, a chain so thin and so tight that Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t actually see it because the skin folded over it. Nonetheless, Mandri knew it was there and he knew what it was; it was meant to bind the treacherous throat of a heretic.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That was the least of the indignities done to this man. His scalp was crudely shaved, chunked and bleeding, and a ring of hair was left to fashion a gleaming madman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s crown. His eyes had been gouged out, and the dark, bloody sockets were filled with ash. His groin had been the target of the most shameful play. Every limb was bent and twisted, and every single one of the poor souls littered about the courtyard had been bent and twisted in precisely the same way.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri noticed Obo peeking out from his litter.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, careful that the Ayramun did not hear, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I guess we know what happened to the Greskalun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93These are not the Greskalun,\u8221\'94 Obo whispered back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re not?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93These are pilgrims.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How\u8217\'92d they get like this?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92d very much like to know that myself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Ayramun were slow to recover from the wilting shock of the scene. Neither Moto nor Moteah could bear to look for longer than a heartbeat. Purl had sunk to her knees, half a gesture of prayer, half a despondent . Seb, a man who could not stand still, was standing as still as dormouse caught in the eye of a hawk. Elrahet hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even stepped foot in the courtyard. She had fallen behind and was sitting deep inside the dark shadow of the tunnel on an inset doorstep. Only the outline of her knees could be seen. Mandri supposed that her witchy senses had warned her of what lay ahead, and she\u8217\'92d decided against polluting her mind with the sight of it. Only Ayram seemed unperturbed. He stood, back straight as ever, and even still the great pack on his shoulders seemed weightless.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said to him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you\u8217\'92d want to see for yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram cast a eye back at his mournful band.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I knew Greskal hated the Hrks, but didn\u8217\'92t think he had this in him. I\u8217\'92m almost impressed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All the better then,\u8221\'94 said Seb as he did a little hop to settle his pack more comfortably on his shoulders. \u8220\'93We should keep going.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri The apparent indifference of the two men drew a murderous look from Moteah. She seemed particularly eager to stick Seb up on one of those poles. It pricked him right in between the eyes, but he shrugged it off.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who cares if a few holy Hrks got what was comin\u8217\'92 to \u8216\'91em?\u8221\'94, he said. \u8220\'93Besides, there\u8217\'92s nothin\u8217\'92 we can do for \u8216\'91em cuz we got the rest of Hrk on our backs. We need to be movin\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And go where?\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb looked at Moteah like she was the dumbest person in the world. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We go find the Greskalun!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is not normal.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The thing to do is keep going! The Greskalun have got to be -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There are no Greskalun!\u8221\'94 Moteah shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then who did all this?\u8221\'94. Seb gestured broadly at the carnage. \u8220\'93Greskal ain\u8217\'92t the only man who hates the Hrks this much, but damn it if he ain\u8217\'92t one of \u8216\'91em.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Greskal would never do anything like this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before Seb could get another word in, Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s worn-out drawl came magnified out of the tunnel behind them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moteah\u8217\'92s right,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Her voice was right at Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck, tickling the backs of his ears. He, like everyone else, spun around and peered dumbly into the darkness of the tunnel. A rattling sigh emanated out from it, and then the shadow of Elrahet stood up. Where before Mandri had been impressed with her verve, she walked now with a hobbling hitch in her step that was hard to place. Was it her left leg or right? Her hip?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They must have sensed the panic,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 More likely all the joints were aching and the lurching was due to whichever one screamed out most. It was as if every minute of the long years of her life were suddenly set upon her.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not Greskal\u8217\'92s panic, no, that wouldn\u8217\'92t have been enough. The panic of the age, the panic of nations - that\u8217\'92s what gets their stomachs growling.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Into the light. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can you sense it, Mazyd? I know you\u8217\'92ve got sharpened senses. Can you sense the panic, or have you been swimming in it so long that you can\u8217\'92t even tell it\u8217\'92s there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can tell when someone\u8217\'92s pissed themselves, if that\u8217\'92s what you\u8217\'92re asking?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93PANIC!\u8221\'94 she screamed. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s panic which sets their stomachs growling. Wakes them right up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you talkin\u8217\'92 bout old crone?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lip curled to reveal her snaggletooth grin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Demons,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The word zipped past Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ear like a unexpected expense. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is not the work of the Greskalun,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93This was demons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was struck into speechlessness, though a sneer still scrunched his grizzled face. To Elrahet, that sneer was as good as saying something. She shot him a side-eyed and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shut up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 so with confusion that he could not stop himself from speaking out of turn.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re talking about, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 demon}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  demons?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet spat. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Say the word a few more times and you might summon them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wanted to say that there were, indeed, other kinds. People could be demons, that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not an uncommon figure of speech. People could have done this. Or, people infested with demons, that\u8217\'92s not unheard of either. A crowd of the demon possessed could have done this. These explanations satisfied expectations. A }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 demon}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  demons, a }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 real}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  demons, that is an extraordinary claim which requires extraordinary evidence.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And what evidence was there?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 None save the butchery.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked for holes in the courtyard floor where winged demonic terrors might have come bursting up through brick, but there were none. There was no cackling laughter, no claw-marks, no hoof-prints. He wanted to point all of this out and demand that Elrahet recant her story, but what kind of person would he be then, to correct a bloodwitch on the matter of demons? He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be a hypocrite. He\u8217\'92d be rejecting someone else\u8217\'92s expertise. So instead, he stayed silent and waited for someone else to take up the challenge. The longer no one did, the more that it was possible.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 possible}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He tried to shake the thought out of his head, but that didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t work.

It was possible that a cloud of demons had poured forth from a fissure and set themselves upon these poor pilgrims. It was also possible that they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d flogged each other and tied themselves up\u8230\'85 somehow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And there wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t one questioning look amongst the Ayramun. Not one, except for Seb, and he didn\u8217\'92t count.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ain\u8217\'92t no demons,\u8221\'94 Seb muttered.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri hoped that someone more sane would step forward and present some other explanation for what had happened here, but none did. Ayram, still the picture of serious contemplation and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll do what we can for them, then we leave.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Damn right,\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93Dead is dead.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet pointed at the carnage with her walking stick and said loudly, that Seb could not twist her words.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They - are - not - dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The words flew like spittle from her lip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked with fresh eyes upon the nearby pilgrim, and what he saw was death. Death was not all that familiar a sight for him, but he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen enough to know that humans were fragile things, and this man had been brutalized beyond comprehension. Mandri was certain there was no way he could still be alive. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He looked closer. His wounds were quite peculiar. The rubbed raw skin on the outside of his thigh, for example, was no mere abrasion, there white rings of fresh skin circumscribing a freshly festering, leaking scab.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The flesh might still be alive, but Mandri had seen a chicken running without a head before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri took a step closer, and as he did, the pligrim\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s torso shuddered, his head jerked back and his tongue reached out of his open mouth, trying the slightes sip of a breath through his chained throat and shattered ribs.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Her knobby finger was pointing at a thin line of blood sprinkled on the ground. It was fresh blood, but not hers or anyone else\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. It had been there without Mandri consciously noticing it, blood that should have seeped into the brick and stained it, or otherwise been lapped up by the sun, and yet there it was, ravishing red, and it ran in a circle around the pilgrim\u8217\'92s pole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The toe of his boot was almost touching it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He jumped back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Would that have been bad?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet looked him up and down. Unsatisfied }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. Would not have been a great loss.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With that she turned and began to hobble back into the tunnel. When no one made an immediate move to follow, she stopped and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We need to leave. Now.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should do what we can for them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We could kill them. That would put an end to this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Their very Sparks are bound to the poles,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet. \u8220\'93Death would not grant them freedom.\u8221\'94 She stamped the dry ground with her short staff and said, \u8220\'93No. We must leave at once.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As this was going on, Mandri came to a startling realization: he hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the slightest idea about how Elrahet . He hadn\u8217\'92t considered, until this very moment, the he might have given up something that he didn\u8217\'92t want. How could a person know how to bind a Spark to a pole with having done it themselves?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His reverie was broken when Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s giant boots started as he walked into the tunnel.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb called out after him, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hold on, we\u8217\'92re goin\u8217\'92 back!?\u8221\'94. He threw his shoulders a fretful fit. \u8220\'93What about the Greskalun?!\u8221\'94 He waved his arms towards the foreboding pass, as if the Greskalun were just right there and you only had to turn back and look to see them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah brushed passed him and said through a curled lip, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There are no Greskalun.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 bwwweeeeOOOOOOOOooooooo}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The horn call sent a shiver of surprise through the tunnel, and before Ayram could bark an order, a distant horse and rider came galloping out from around a shelf of sandstone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The horse, white as foam, came stumbling to a stop and reared up almost to the point of no control. The rider, a man as dark as Moto and clad in the familiar blue robe of a Riga scribe, shouted a command to his beast to settle it down, and all the while his face was trained on the tunnel where Mandri and the Ayramun stood.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The feeling of being found when you don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to be is a horrible, horrible feeling. To Mandri it was like waking up from sleep. He spends the night in the blissful embrace of sleep and then a moment later he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 finds}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  himself awake. It was always horrible. It hearkened back to the day of birth, when he was resting comfortably in the hiding place that was the womb, and then suddenly, cruelly, he was found. In a way, life was one long journey of finding a nice hidey hole and then being rudely pulled from it, then finding another, and being pulled out of that one too. And once found, there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s no going back - he couldn\u8217\'92t be unfound. He could be found and then }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 lost}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , but being lost is always tainted with the history of being found, so it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not the same - not the same in the slightest. At some point, people give up chasing that false dream of losing themselves permanently in a hidey hole, and while Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t quite there yet, in front of him was a Hrkan horde, and behind him was a corpse strewn courtyard, so he wondered if there was a point in trying to run away from this one.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb seemed to think so. He was already there in the courtyard, wanting everyone else to follow him into the pass.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come on!\u8221\'94 he urged.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram did the opposite, he unshouldered his great pack and tossed it against the side of the tunnel. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Hrkan rider was now trotting towards them. In this scribe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hand was a sword, and he held it high so that the blade and golden guard caught the glare of the sun. When he had covered a quarter of the distance, he halted his horse, barked some indiscernible word, and then, with a sweeping flourish, threw his sword onto the sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto, who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been halfway ready to sprint and tying off parts of his dress to make himself ready for battle, saw the scribe\u8217\'92s sign and gaped in disbelief. \u8220\'93They want to bargain?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Hrkan horn sounded out agian.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 bwwweeeeOOOOoooooooooo}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then, from around the shelf whence the scribe had come, At their head was a child robed in black - the Mazydariga.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The same reason anyone bargains - they don\u8217\'92t think they can take what they want without getting hurt.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe they think the Greskalun are here and on our side.\u8221\'94}

Behind me, as you can see, is the Riga of Aym, and coming up from the Shulraket is the Mazyd Doon, who shall be with us shortly. As such, you are surrounded, and should it come to blows you }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 will}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  be overwhelmed.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stroked his beard, and then he looked up at the sky, arced his shoulders, and he took in a breath that could fill a horse\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach. When he turned round there was a fire in his eyes which Mandri had not seen since Minting Rock, and when Ayram marched over to where Mandri stood, and reached over his shoulder, Mandri was rooted to the spot simmering just under the surface.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram reached over Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder, pulled Obo out from his litter by the skull, and in one rude, fluid motion, Ayram flung the Mazyd towards the scribe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The black horse whinnied in alarm as Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s withered, legless form slid pitifully on the dirt towards it, and the scribe\u8217\'92s eyes were agog with disbelief.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this?\u8221\'94 the scribe asked as struggled to settle his horse\u8217\'92s fright.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stepped towards Obo, casual as a dog , and he pointed to Obo with his blackened iron bar and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t recognize a Mazyd when you see one?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And all this was to Mandri. Was that Obo, usually unperturbed by rough treatment, usually amused by seriousness, was himself in a serious concern. It seemed the he was afraid to move or speak, lest he upset the delicate tension that was building.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribe himself was not so. His face twisted into wry smile at the sight of Obo naked and afraid.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To be clear,\u8221\'94 said the scribe, \u8220\'93there are only two ways make a Mazyd safe - a Riga\u8217\'92s whistle, or the Mazyd\u8217\'92s minder must be killed. As our Riga\u8217\'92s whistle does not work, your girl must be killed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribe said this as if he were speaking of slaughtering livestock. Worse than livestock. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even honor Purl with a callous, appraising eye.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Put a simmer of anger in Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s deep voice. \u8220\'93There are other ways,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Such as?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram turned towards Elrahet with the gleam of expectation in his eyes. She stepped forward out of the tunnel and said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I had use of your Riga, good sir, I could render the Mazyd inert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The knowledge is beyond you. I do not mean to inflict illusions. Be sure that the Riga child will not survive the process.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve yet to mention what you\u8217\'92re offering in return.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is an object of great value. I can\u8217\'92t tell you what it is, because I would be breaking a vow if I did. You will know it when you see it, and I can assure you, you will find the trade most equitable.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With that, the scribe yanked on his horse\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s reins, jabbed it\u8217\'92s flanks with his heels and they went galloping back towards the Hrkan line.  }
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram turned around around, and on his face a smile as white and gleaming as. Maybe it was the biggest smile humanly possible, considering the size of his head.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Wonder what he\u8217\'92s going to try to trade.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s not bringing anything. The dumb bastard thinks he take me. He\u8217\'92s going to bring the riga right to us.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You weren\u8217\'92t serious about hiding in the mountains, were you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t worry about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, I\u8217\'92m gonna worry about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Once I strike that man down, we need to run. I\u8217\'92m not going to stop help any of you get your shit together, so if you\u8217\'92re not ready, if you fall behind, you\u8217\'92re dead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He untied the strap that kept his pack shut, then lifted it up and dumped the pack\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s contents on the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Split this up between you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then he grabbed Obo, and stuffed the Mazyd into his empty pack.}
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once inside, a oddly compliant Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know, I could ruin this for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram glared down into the pack as if he were ready to murder Obo right then and there.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going to ruin it,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93I just wanted you all to know that I could have, but I\u8217\'92m not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram pulled his pack\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s drawstring tight. \u8220\'93The best thing about all this,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93Is that we\u8217\'92ll finally be rid of this noise.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A rustling is Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack as Obo worked to poke his head out of it. Once is bald head was, a, he shouted, \u8220\'93Mandri! Never let it be said that I didn\u8217\'92t do anything for these people!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri felt himself knotting up as Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pale saucer eyes fixed on him - him and no one else. Odd that he should feel this way for so strange a face, though framed as Obo was against Ayram\u8217\'92s absurd physique, Obo almost looked normal. Or, maybe that had nothing to do with it. Some mothers love children with faces much worse off than Obo\u8217\'92s\u8230\'85 not that Mandri was feeling something as deep as love. It wasn\u8217\'92t odd to feel sad for someone who\u8217\'92d had a rough life. Suppose that Obo truly didn\u8217\'92t feel pain, or chose not to, all the abuse still had to have some effect on his mind or sense of self, and if that weren\u8217\'92t true, it didn\u8217\'92t matter, because Mandri could be sad at the sight of a wilting flower and flowers don\u8217\'92t feel pain or sadness, they don\u8217\'92t have minds at all. But flowers are beautiful, and beauty certainty wasn\u8217\'92t in play here. The pang that Mandri now felt in his chest as he watched a compliant Obo being carried off to his doom was a pang of loss, yes, but loss of what? He wasn\u8217\'92t sure.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And, oh! This was a problem. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t ignore the budding sense that something was being uncovered here, and as any self-watcher knows, finding things out about oneself is the worst kind of finding. So Mandri tried to ignore it. He looked away from Obo, and And he transformed that pang from loss to guilt start to wrap it\u8217\'92s cold hands around his lungs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Right as these thoughts began to coalesce into a monster, Moto yanked the litter right off Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s back and began to fill it with the stuff that had fallen out of Ayram\u8217\'92s pack; skins of water, sticky bars of grain, lumps of something wrapped in linen paper and the like. When Moto handed the pack back to Mandri, it was twice the weight that Obo ever was. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then other Ayramun began to do the same, fill their packs with Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stuff, and Seb, in an attempt to reorganize his pack\u8217\'92s interior to make room for a bundle of dried beef, pulled out a woolen blanket, and in so doing, pulled his bag of burgeons out as well. When the burgeon bag hit the ground, out popped three God\u8217\'92s Eye burgeons. Two of them spiraled harmlessly in little circles, but one burgeon hit the ground rolling as if flicked towards Mandri\u8217\'92s toes by Solraheen himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri covered it up with his foot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Seb finally noticed that his burgeons had spilled out, he snatched them up, quick as a fox, none the wiser that he was short one burgeon.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 For Mandri, the feeling of that burgeon under his heel was almost enough in iteself to drive away the guilt.}
