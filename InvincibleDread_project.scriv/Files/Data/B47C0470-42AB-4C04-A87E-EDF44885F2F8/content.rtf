\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram handed Mandri a few strings of jerked beef. It was a morning present to liven his spirits, and this it did with some aplomb, for the beef was spiced with peppercorn and, at some point in it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s humble existence, it had been soaked in a honeyed jelly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It buttered him up, but for what?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you see a man on our journey through the pass, don\u8217\'92t stop and point. Don\u8217\'92t stop walking for any reason, unless I say.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram cringed as if Mandri had just spit on his boot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do what I say,\u8221\'94 Ayram said, \u8220\'93and do it without question. Once we\u8217\'92re through the pass, you can piss in the wind all you like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stomped off, his spud bar thudding against the dirt. His enormous pack was already fastened to his shoulders, and as he took off south along the edge of the mountain\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet, and the rest of the Ayramun got up and followed him. Moto stayed behind and gave Mandri a kick.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sighed, popped the last pinch of beef into his mouth, and savored its flavors. He stretched the moment with a beatific smile, and just before Moto was about to kick him again, he stood up, then put Obo in his litter. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As Mandri fitted the straps of Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter onto his back, Moto said, \u8220\'93One thing that Ayram forgot to mention: don\u8217\'92t talk.\u8221\'94 He gave Obo an evil eye and added, \u8220\'93That goes doubly for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But how will I pass the time?\u8221\'94 Obo asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In silence.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What are you so worried about? You said that every tribe would honor the sanctity of Goree Pass.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not at night. We can\u8217\'92t be found there at night, so we have to get through it in one day, which will be easy enough if you get a move on, Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright, alright.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri set off at a clip to catch up to Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s column.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They walked for an hour in the blue shadow of the mountains, Ayram the mother duck in front, and Moto in the back, with everyone in the middle keeping a tight formation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Twice Mandri clipped Moteah\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s heels. The first time she ignored it. The second, she stopped and glared at him. Mandri said sorry and spiced it with a sheepish grin, then added that his legs were too used to flat ground. The rocks here popped up like roots, and it was hard to take his eyes off the massive, swooping, wind-carved edifices that towered to his left. The great bulk of the sandstone had such a smooth, cupped curve, that it looked like a giant red wave rolling into the desert.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As they walked south, the character of the stone changed. It was more fractured, split, and crumbly. The ground was littered with boulders, they had to weave up into the foot of the mountain, and weave a trail around scattered boulders.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As far as passes go, the Goree Pass was not easily passable. By the time their course headed east, the way was a maze of swerving stone pillars and water-carved canyons the width of person. Mandri tried to map the place mentally, but gave up the third time that Ayram led them into a dead end. More of a canyon root system, as if a tree the size of a storm cloud grew here, and it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s roots had carved out these paths.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Striated canyons. Flanged red rock. At times the canyon walls belled out and Mandri could see the slopes of the mountains stretching up beyond vision, and those mountains weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t the only thing that took getting used to. The air was buzzing with the faint, wheezing screeches of vultures soaring on thermals high overhead, out of sight, glimpsed, so far out that these shrieks reached Mandri\u8217\'92s ear like whispers. If he didn\u8217\'92t know better, he would have thought it was the haggard language of the rocks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And there were delights in these canyon paths - pools of water resting in shallow basins, sheltered from the sun, deep enough for Mandri to scrape a handful and splash his face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s too easy to personify a landscape. Every painter does it. A rolling hill becomes a . A mountain becomes a. to greater or lesser degrees. A landscape has a character. }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo gives sharp whistle, Mandri to cringe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stopped the march. He stepped out of line and glared at Mandri. Mandri pointed his thumb at Obo. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do I need to muzzle you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s clarient drawl d, \u8220\'93Could you please pick up that bone over there? On the other side of that rock, there\u8217\'92s a bone that I\u8217\'92d like to take a look at.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri craned his neck around to see what Obo was talking about. In so doing, around to see.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, please turn back around.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want to see what you\u8217\'92re talking about.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto had wandered over to a knee-high shoulder of rock, and he knelt down to pick something up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A gleaming white ball joint and a short, splintered haft of bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a leg knuckle,\u8221\'94 Moto said. He handed it to Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s called a femur.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Elrahet pushed through the gathering crowd and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s the matter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazyd wants to look at this bone.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone looked at Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See that fracture?\u8221\'94 Obo said, \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s an unusual fracture.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s unusual about it?\u8221\'94 asked Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Breaking a bone along its length is not easy, not likely to happen accidentally.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In Ayrams probing hands the bone looked like a child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s. He said, \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re saying there\u8217\'92s been a killing in the Pass?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto pointed at some discoloration on the and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Somewhat recent, too, by the looks of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not just a killing,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93A blow to the leg would not result in a medial split like that. Well, that }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 could}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  happen, but the chances of that would be one in a million. Accidental.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet grumbled, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s your point?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve seen material like this in a late Old Jandri site. A collapsed society. Too many people and not enough bread, and so the people started eating other people... See, that is the kind of fracture a human makes when he wants to gnaw on the spongy marrow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mind ran flush with images of a barbarian gnawing on a bone as if it were an ear of corn. He turned around to get another look at that bone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram tested the sharpness of the break with the tip of his finger.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How far away are the Hrks?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only thing I can say for certain is that they\u8217\'92re headed this way, and not just from the east. They\u8217\'92ll be looking to catch us coming out of the Pass from the west as well.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ahhh, fuck.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We should be }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 moving,}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Seb said. \u8220\'93So what if there\u8217\'92s a bone? It doesn\u8217\'92t mean anything. This is the Goree Pass, no one would dare break its sanctity.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, be quiet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But we don\u8217\'92t have a choice! We\u8217\'92ve got to keep going!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seb, another word, and I\u8217\'92m going to get upset.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri is like fuck. A bit humilitating. Watch Purl, bored.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a whole mess of bones over here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everyone crowded around Purl. At her feet was a jumble of broken leg and arm bones.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Someone\u8217\'92s had a fest,\u8221\'94 said }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moto.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want you and your sister to scout ahead, the whole length of the pass. If there\u8217\'92s people, if there\u8217\'92s an ambush, I want to know about it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That will take a few hours.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We need to know what we\u8217\'92re walking into. The rest of us will find a place to keep out of sight, near this spot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I should go too,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Two is enough.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both Moto and Moteah dropped their shimmied out of their packs and Moto pulled out two long sandstone-colored cloaks, tossed one to Moteah, and then they clambered up the southern slope and disappeared from view.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram led the everyone else back east, where he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d seen a shallow mouth in the base of the northern slope, obscured, in part, by pillar of rock that looked like a giant seed. They all tucked themselves behind this pillar, so that an idle eye of anyone wandering by wouldn\u8217\'92t be able to see them.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri settled in for a nice, long wait.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A fluttered flute of a whistle from the path.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram pursed his lips and came .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah rushed in, crouched, her red cloak bunched up at her feet and in a hurried whisper she said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s an ambush. Only a few hundred yards ahead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How many men?\u8221\'94 Ayram whispered back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I Counted twelve. Couldn\u8217\'92t be more than twenty in all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto came stumbling in. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I counted fourteen. It\u8217\'92s an wider valley,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93With a tall slope,\u8221\'94 he flattened his hand in the air to illustrate the incline, nearly plumb. \u8220\'93At the top it\u8217\'92s a vertical wall of rock.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A canyon,\u8221\'94 Moteah clarified.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And at the bottom of this valley, there\u8217\'92s a boulder the size of Minting Rock sitting right in the middle, plugging the gap.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is it impassible?\u8221\'94 Ayram asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a narrow tunnel carved into the bottom, tall enough for a horse. The ambush is set on the other side of this tunnel.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I bet they\u8217\'92ve pushed that boulder down themselves,\u8221\'94 Moteah said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto sighed and squatted down. His face contorted into a look of pained stress. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s strange is that there\u8217\'92s a man sitting at the tunnel entrance, pretending to be a traveler. At least that\u8217\'92s what I think he\u8217\'92s doing, cause he\u8217\'92s got a traveler\u8217\'92s pack.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s bait,\u8221\'94 said Moteah}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But what do they need bait for?\u8221\'94 Moto asked. \u8220\'93They\u8217\'92ve got the ambush set, just spring it! Don\u8217\'92t need to put a man down in the valley where he\u8217\'92s liable to get pricked.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram folded his arms.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Scratched his nose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rubbed his bushy brow with his finger and thumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thirty men, you say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Twenty at most,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I counted fourteen,\u8221\'94 Moto reminded everyone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram drummed his fingers against his chin, then tugged at his bottom lip. He was such a perfect picture of indecision, that Mandri nearly asked for a slip of paper so that he could draw it, and not just Ayram, the scene itself. Sometime nature has a way of organizing itself into a natural composition. Ayram there, standing tall, his head the apex of a pyramid of people, all looking at him for direction, and the weight of their expectations sat heavy on his brow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was Elrahet who broke the edge. Her words a firm encouragement. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We are going through,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They know we\u8217\'92re coming, that much is clear. Still, it is only twenty\u8230\'85 though we\u8217\'92ve only five arrows between us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He turned his cutting eye to Obo and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suppose you\u8217\'92d be any help.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo lit up with astonishment. A cheeky split his lips as he watched everyone watch him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Aren\u8217\'92t I alluring\u8230\'85\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Right now, they\u8217\'92re sitting there stewing, wondering why we haven\u8217\'92t shown up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And let me guess, you\u8217\'92re thinking we should all amble right on into that trap, spring it, and when all the little weeds sprout out from behind the rocks, have me deal with them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You killed fifty of my own people in a ravine. In the rain. With the light of day, you could kill twenty freaks with one flick of your neck.\u8221\'94 }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re going to do it, because there\u8217\'92s no scenario here where you betray me and walk out alive.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you understood that threats have no effect on me.\u8221\'94}

I\u8217\'92ll do it on the condition that you open your heart to good graces of your nature and say, \u8216\'91thank you\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram stood up and straightened his back. As his taught lips squirmed in , as if the words left such distaste.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is ridiculous,\u8221\'94 said Elrahet as she stepped forward.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb cried, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We can\u8217\'92t trust him!\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah was the only one with determination. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no way around,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93At least, none we can take without running into Hrks.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s either this, or we start from scratch.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen listened with rapt attention, for the occasion had his heart aflutter with a restless energy, like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d just drank a quart of burn-nut tea. His arms and legs felt curious, and there was an urge to inject himself into the situation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And there was a logic to him getting involved.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo needed to be carried into a dangerous place, and Mandri had been carrying Obo for days. Why stop now?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was chance whoever did it could be killed, and Mandri had been cheating death for the past few weeks. Why stop now?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The universe was lining him up for this.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 On top of it all, he had Sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lucky rocks. He didn\u8217\'92t believe in luck, but the fact he had the rocks at all was a sign of his auspicious future, it was part of the theme, as the Solitants say,  \u8216\'91when Solraheen speaks to you, it\u8217\'92s not in words, it\u8217\'92s in coincidences.\u8217\'92 He was given those rocks so that they could encourage him now, in this moment, a against is robe, and when this emotion reached the boiling point, he stood up straight and blurted out, \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The words landed amongst the Ayram like a duck. Moto looked at Mandri like he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d just  . Elrahet, like a . Purl snorted in disbelief. Moteah heard but pretended she hadn\u8217\'92t.  Ayram smirked, and said, \u8220\'93Now\u8217\'92s not the time, Mandri.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, \u8220\'93All you need is someone to walk into that ambush\u8230\'85 I\u8217\'92m willing to do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, half in jest, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, Now him, we can\u8217\'92t trust.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s serious,\u8221\'94 Moteah said with a hint of amusement.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He does have a death wish,\u8221\'94 said Moto.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A little.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A muted laugh , and Moteah shook her head and Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s naivety. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This was no laughing matter to Elrahet. Her visage was stone serious. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Many have died testing prophecy,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93It is not a wise thing to do.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I should have died like ten times already. And I can tell by the fact that none of you are outright shutting me down, that you all like the idea. I know Ayram does.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram was a rigid pole. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m trying to think of a reason not to let you do it,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Worst that can happen is I die,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93And let\u8217\'92s be honest, it\u8217\'92s better me than you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can\u8217\'92t argue with that,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram shot Seb a annoyed look, then held Mandri in his disquieting gaze. A pregnant silence emerged in that little interstice, and a doubtful anxiety started to creep up Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s spine. He decided that if he just started acting, that put an end to it. It would shift Ayram\u8217\'92s burden from one of command, to a reserved acceptance of this new reality.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He bent down, picked up Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s litter, which still had Obo strapped in it, and then shouldered the burden and said, \u8220\'93Alright. Now which way is my uncertain death?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hold on,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. He placed his massive hand on Mandri\u8217\'92s shoulder. \u8220\'93Wait.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Ayram turned to Moto and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take what arrows we have and get up as high as you can.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Without so much as a nod, Moto set to gathering what he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d need.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you,\u8221\'94 Ayram said to Obo, \u8220\'93If this boy comes out of this unhurt, then I\u8217\'92ll say thank you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram pointed out the path, a pitted road of sand that under a shelf of rock, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just follow it.\u8221\'94 And so Mandri did.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He followed the path east as it wound through the shattered mountain. He felt like a hunter, careful to soften is footfalls, eyes trained on, limbs . He peeked around every rock and bend, should . }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo, impatient with this , said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll tell you when we\u8217\'92re almost there.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey Obo?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93When the Ayramun ambushed you, did you let it happen?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What makes you think I\u8217\'92d do something as silly as that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can see through rock, can\u8217\'92t you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then how are you always noticing things before anyone else.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can see }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 around}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  rocks.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sound. It bounces off of things, and it bounces off them differently depending on the surface, be it rock, dirt, or lizard skin. Such adumbrations provide a fuzzy image of the contents of the room I\u8217\'92ve yet to enter, or the layout of the canyon ahead.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So you can hear an ambush before you walk into it?\u8221\'94}

But I\u8217\'92ll know we\u8217\'92re close when I can hear them breathing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How far away would that be?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ll find out soon. Just two bends left to go.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri walked, and when he came to the second bend, a shadowed, Obo told him to stop.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want to a clear sight of what we\u8217\'92re up against.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri peeked around first.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Around the bend, the way emptied out into a wider, sun-drenched valley. A mere twenty yards away, plugging up the middle of this valley, was a boulder twice the size of Minting Rock. It would have made the way impassable for a horse, but for the circular hole in its base, and this hole offered some estimation of the boulder\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s girth, for the sunlight peeking through the other side could be blotted out with an arm-length thumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 To right of the hole\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s entrance, was the much anticipated man. He was robed in a honeyed yellow, an the color of unassumption, and he was strapped into a pack the size and shape of a small shed wrapped in a . he was sitting, legs straight out and limp, pack against the rock, pretending to sleep.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pretending to snore. It was such a comically loud, open-mouthed, buck-toothed, snore, like the man wanted to make sure that at whatever distance, comers-along would know what he was up to - just an innocent daytime dream. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His face betrayed that narrative. He had the look, if leathery skin of a mountain cannibal. A wild scraggle of curly hair framed a gleaming madman\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s crown. His narrow face was beset by two large jug ears, and could almost hear the fleas crying out from the man\u8217\'92s pointed, scruff of a chin. And there was an animal look to him, for his nose and mouth protruded out, almost a snout, and while his crooked yellow teeth weren\u8217\'92t filed to a point, it was clear that he didn\u8217\'92t lead a balanced diet. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then again, maybe Mandri was reading too much into the man. He knew it was hard to disassociate what he knew about a person from what was there in the face\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s features, and he knew this man was a cannibal, and so he saw a cannibal. Regardless, if he were to paint the man, it would be difficult to do what a good portrait artist is supposed to do and look upon the creature with a mother\u8217\'92s eyes.}

See, I think these bandits know more about our coming than just our number. I think they know of Ayram, and I think they know of me, and I think, that they think, that the best way to take out a Mazyd, if you haven\u8217\'92t a Riga, is to get close with deception and cut off the unsuspecting head.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Never questioned it, I guess.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ll have to ask Ayram,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m good in a scrap,\u8221\'94 said Greskal. \u8220\'93Even got my own blade.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal pulled a short sword from a sheath that had been stitched into his pack. It was an exquisite piece, patterned steel, and the rim of was was rimmed with smooth amber.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The sudden appearance of a blade. He heeded Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s advice and stepped back. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re making me nervous here, Greskal.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal looked up and laughed at Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s reticence. \u8220\'93Apologies. Apologies,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Just wanted to show you, is all. It\u8217\'92s brand new.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, I can see that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal twirled the blade under his arm, and in one smooth motion, sheathed it back in his pack. Mandri supposed this little flourish was a show to let him know that Greskal wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t one to be trifled with, though he wondered why Greskal bothered. If the man\u8217\'92s goal was to get close, then surely, he\u8217\'92d want Mandri trifling as much as a soft-eared flea.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So!\u8221\'94 said Greskal. \u8220\'93Suppose\u8217\'92n we wait for this Ayram, then?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We could,\u8221\'94 said Mandri, \u8220\'93but I\u8217\'92m going to keep walking.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93All the same to me. Mind if I follow?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Uh, I do mind, actually.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal looked bewildered. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can\u8217\'92t rightly stop me from headin\u8217\'92 east. There\u8217\'92s only the one way, and you don\u8217\'92t own it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can follow, just keep a distance. You pulling out that blade has got me on edge.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Right. Well, I\u8217\'92m no highwayman. I was a fingerman once, well, a fingerchild, but no highwayman. I\u8217\'92ll walk in front, if that\u8217\'92ll give you peace.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It would.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Alright. Off I go then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal bounced on his toes to settle his pack, and then walked into boulder\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s round tunnel, his tall pack nearly scraping the roof. Once he was all the way through, and still going, Mandri started after him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 One step into that short tunnel, and fear seized Mandri. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t shake the notion that as soon as he stepped into the light, he\u8217\'92d be peppered with arrows.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s assuring voice crept up. \u8220\'93Keep going,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Just outside, up and to the left, there should be a man peeking around a boulder.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m thinking that I should walk through backwards.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just go.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri walked, and as he stepped into the sunlight, he looked up the northern slope and did not see a peeking head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked forward, walking slow, and whispered under his breath, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t see him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s there,\u8221\'94 came the barely audible reply.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked again, then he saw, high up on a ridge was a boulder that looked like a shark\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tooth, and poking out from behind it, like a weed, was the wooden limb of a recurve bow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He started walking again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If this was the ambush, why was Greskal still going?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Enough with the games. He just wanted this over and done with.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hey Greskal!\u8221\'94 Mandri called.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pack was so top heavy, that it took him five steps to turn around.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is it?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come here real quick.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whatchya on about?\u8221\'94 Greskal said as he trudged back towards Mandri. When he was within striking distance, Mandri pointed, and said, \u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s an interesting weed up there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal face contorted as he saw .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A brusque, unintelligible whisper sounded out from the rocks above, and the wooden bow-tip was yanked out of sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Greskal shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know we can see you, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A snarled retort sprang from the unseen heights. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A black, turbaned head sprouted up from the boulder above, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t botch nothin\u8217\'92!\u8221\'94 the man said. \u8220\'93You botched it!\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you put this show on for every traveler you rob, or is this the first time? I\u8217\'92ll tell you this, two men ain\u8217\'92t going to cut it with me.\u8221\'94}
