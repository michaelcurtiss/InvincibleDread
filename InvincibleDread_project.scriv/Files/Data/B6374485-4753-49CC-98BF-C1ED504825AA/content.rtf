\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Figure out how to work in the blackshells to the west.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Blood thick in pyetles hand.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Great Soldgi Erg is a sea of sand that scours the eastern rib of the Jandrian continent, and people who grow up within sight of it grow up with the story of how those dunes came to be. Every time the story is told some details are added, some forgotten, and sometimes even the heart of it will change. The only thing that everyone agrees upon is that a god named Sol made those mountains of sand a long time ago, back when he walked the earth alone, and that is why it is called the Great Soldgi Erg. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s was what was on Pyetle\u8217\'92s mind as he and the scribe Soreel lounged in his field, drinking his brew. When he asked Soreel if she believed the story about how the Erg was made, she could only scratch her head and ask, \u8220\'93Which story do you mean?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She gave a little half-sipped, absent sigh as she said it, the kind of sigh that you give when someone drunker-than-you starts to feel like they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re making sense of things. Soreel wanted to laze the day away in silence, wanted to drink Pyetle\u8217\'92s brew in silence, wanted to enjoy the cool Istil wind from the shade of a fat cedar tree in silence. She wanted to keep to her plan: waste time out in Pyetle\u8217\'92s field until the sun started to set, and then she would do what she came here to do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t drink too much because it was past midday and if she fell asleep she might not wake up until night. Already she could feel her head swirling and her eyelids slouching, intent on doing as little work as she was. The sun bearing down on the barren field all around wasn\u8217\'92t helping things. The glare was so bright that she could naught but squint, and that was near enough to having them closed that her buzzing brain had trouble marking the difference.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t anything to look at either. Pyetle\u8217\'92s farm was twelve thousand square metres of wasteland. There was once a time when it boasted a harvest of legumes - soy, redbean and the like - but when salt started to show on the surface Pyetle was forced to plant barley. Nowadays the land was so salt-ridden that it looked like a sweat-stained shirt, and the only thing that would grow for miles around was the cedar tree under which they sat. The only thing that moved were the flies that buzzed around the ox\u8217\'92s ringed snout. Soreel distracted herself from sleep by watching them as the ox would snore and blow them out of his nose, and then they would fly back in to lick at the only source of moisture they could find amidst this desolation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m talking about the story that says it was all an accident,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the story I like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel stifled a groan and humored Pyetle by looking towards where he was pointing. There the distant southern horizon was rimmed by a hazy red blur of mounding sand; the Great Soldgi Erg.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s the first story about Sol I can remember. I must have been about\u8230\'85 I don\u8217\'92t know\u8230\'85 four when I first heard it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That would be why,\u8221\'94 Soreel muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s why I haven\u8217\'92t heard it. You heard it when you were four. That was a long time ago. By the time I got around to being me I bet that story had been forgotten.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No it hasn\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Clearly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle smiled. He had a gummy smile which cradled a few precious teeth. Soreel knew he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t as old as he looked because he looked as old as the gnarled tree against which he sat. He was only fifty-two, but with how lined and leathered his skin was, how white his scraggled beard, he seemed seventy. His color was just like a Jandri slave\u8217\'92s - dark and dirty umber everywhere but the top of his bald olive head which had been spared from the sun by his straw hat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel hated how Pyetle was always smiling. He always smiled when he was drunk. He was a lively drunk. In fact the drunker he got the more intelligible he got because when he was sober he mumbled. There was always a point where he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have too much and the spittle would start to run down his chin but he rarely ever got there. He was old and skinny but he could hold his drink.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He could feel Soreel looking at him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He asked her,\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93 Do you want to know how the story goes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, not really.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well the story goes that Sol wanted to build a garden to cover all the land.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel closed her eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t interrupt when I\u8217\'92m telling it,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell it then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle took another swig of his beer, and then he continued on.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol planted a stick in the ground just south of here to mark one of the garden\u8217\'92s six corners.\u8221\'94 Pyetle pointed towards the Soldgi Erg. \u8220\'93Sol then left to Sol-knows-where to measure out the rest of it. Well, that stick in the ground, that was the accident.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel looked and saw the Pyetle had a twig in his hand. He was poking it into hard, dry earth next to his hip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol planted that stick in the ground and then he left. Then in a few days a little - a little embryo of a sand dune built up in that stick\u8217\'92s lee.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle built up a little hump of dirt to the side of his own stick to demonstrate. Soreel wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t watching but Pyetle didn\u8217\'92t notice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See it was all by accident. By accident Sol }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 happened}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to put his stick in }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 just}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  the right spot, and it was left alone for just long enough, that the wind built that little hump of sand higher and higher. It grew wide and tall and in no time at all the first sand dune was born.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At that he rubbed out his own little fledgling dune.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93By accident?\u8221\'94 Soreel asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An accident. Sure. Why not? You can\u8217\'92t tell me that Sol }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 meant}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to turn good black earth into a mountain of sand. And that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what happened. While Sol was off wandering in the middle of Sol-knows-where, shaping rivers, mountains, and fields and whatnot, that little dune got large enough to sustain itself. Large enough to not be blown away by the first squall or rainstorm. Then years passed and the Istil wind\u8230\'85 well it stretched that dune south and east all the way to the southern tip of Corin.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What about all the other dunes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah, see, that first dune grew tall, so tall that it rippled the wind and created a kind of nursery for neat little rows of dunes behind it. Those littler dunes would grow and grow. Soon they covered the land in all directions. And so them dunes over there came to be. The Great Soldgi Erg.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think that\u8217\'92s how it happened.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So you don\u8217\'92t believe it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hard to believe.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You could say it gets harder. Because we have to say that Sol not only made a mistake, but he gave up. See the earth over there was once spongy and black. It was good earth. Not like this salty shit that I\u8217\'92ve got. Then Sol stuck his stick in the ground and then - boom - sand. Sol rightly figured that clearing the sand was such a task that he just up and left. Decided not to do it. He gave up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not what happened.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh? Were you there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol knows the Istil wind. He knows the appetite of the sand. He made them. Everyone knows that he pulled the Erg up from the earth. The Soldgi Erg }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  the garden.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle spat a little spittle onto the ground. The earth was so dry and caked by the sun, as hard as fired clay, that the spit just lingered there on the surface. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You sound just like one of Sol\u8217\'92s itinerants,\u8221\'94 he said. He then stood up and assumed a pose in mock imitation of those traveling preachers. He kept his chin up, kept his shoulders arced and then stretched his hand out to the heavens. He began to preach in kind, voice inflected with grandeur as if addressing an unbeliever.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See how Sol\u8217\'92s golden light shimmers across Sand. A sweet smelling rose or a pink-petaled poppy would be naught but a blemish on such beauty.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He then took another swig of his beer. He tilted his head back to let thick brew run clean down his throat. He tilted a little too far back and so he stumbled. In that half-time grace where the body notices things just a hair too late. But he caught himself before he fell down. He wiped his lips with his arm as he finished, then nearly spat on Soreel as he charged what he thought was her ignorance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you ever actually been down to the Erg? Climbed one of the dunes? I doubt you could even do it. Aside from the sand-spitting wind that rakes the skin and the sores that well up in between your toes, the view is really nothing special. \u8216\'91Ooooh, a big pile of sand! How wonderful! Praise the maker!\u8217\'92I mean see it once, sure, but really the best thing about it is the sky. And the sky is\u8230\'85 the sky. Its everywhere. Don\u8217\'92t need to spend three fingers climbing a dune to see it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you care?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do I care?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know you\u8217\'92re trying to make some point. I\u8217\'92d rather you be out with it instead of spitting every where.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The point, girl, is that even Sol messed up and made a mess of things, so you can hardly blame me for what I\u8217\'92ve done.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel laughed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that what all this is, then? A prelude to an excuse?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not an excuse.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not here to here you out, Pyetle. I\u8217\'92m here to take you back with me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel brushed off her sleeves and made a show of standing up. She stretched like she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d never done it before. Her little stir woke up the oxand he mooed in irritation. She said, \u8220\'93I suppose if we head out now it will be dark when we get back.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t have a choice.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You going to carry me all the way back to Mudwater?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulders slumped as she realized Pyetle was intent on making this as difficult as possible for her. She was always stuck with the shit-end jobs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pyetle, please. Just come with me. I\u8217\'92ll strap you to the ox if need be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s my ox. I\u8217\'92m staying. Gil stays.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You named the ox Gil?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Gil mooed in recognition.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well Gil isn\u8217\'92t yours anymore.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pyetle, three months ago you were sixty-two thousand fingers in debt. Then you bought poor Gil here. Now you\u8217\'92re sixty-four thousand fingers in debt.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nonsense.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you even use him for anything?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Gil kept me company.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You bought an ox for company?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I did and he\u8217\'92s not for sale.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s not yours to sell! Your field, your ox, you yourself, you\u8217\'92ve all already been bought.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93By who? The city owns my debt.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who!?\u8221\'94 Soreel exclaimed. She knew Pyetle knew exactly who. Pyetle\u8217\'92s grim expression.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Pyetle said as he sat back down into his little nook in the tree. His nonchalance further irritated Soreel out of her wits. Her face was stuck in this blank expression, thin lipped and squint-eyed, churning . Then the corners of mouth twisted into a wry smile.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They sold it to Salavan,\u8221\'94 she said. She took pleasure in the way the name made Pyetle squirm to attention.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They can\u8217\'92t do that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 sixty-four-thousand fingers in debt}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re old. Your field is done. It\u8217\'92s not worth the time it takes to walk across it. But what\u8217\'92s got the scribblers really worried is that you have no kids so there is no one else they can shift the debt on to. If you die it becomes their problem, and since Salavan was willing to pay it off in return for you and everything you\u8217\'92ve got, they bent the rules.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle burped. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel did her best to ignore Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s outburst and started to pull on Gil\u8217\'92s nose ring to get him to stand up. The ox didn\u8217\'92t budge.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re not going,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I feel like it should be obvious that Gil and I are quite content to sit here and die.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With a huff Soreel let go of Gil\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ring and then she spat on him. Gil just blinked. The flies rushed out of Gil\u8217\'92s nose to chase the bit of spittle that had landed on his snout. Soreel grimaced, then put a hand on her hip and waved a finger in faces of these wasted souls.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look. You are going to spend what few years you have left as Salavan\u8217\'92s slaves. Pyetle, you\u8217\'92re going to the brewhouse and will be making your sweet beer for little rich princes that wander this way. Gil\u8217\'92s going to work the wheel. I mean honestly, thats what you should have been doing for the past twenty years.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 While she was talking, Pyetle had begun to shake his head, and like a toddler he just kept going, shaking is his head, saying \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91nope\u8230\'85nope\u8230\'85nope\u8230\'85\u8217\'92under his breath.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel laughed the laugh of the offended before letting Pyetle in on how things really were.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Salavan doesn\u8217\'92t care about you. He wanted your recipes, but he really wanted the land.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He can have it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said you wouldn\u8217\'92t come but he insisted that I should try anyways. So here I am, insisting.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle heard the draw of a blade and thens aw that Soreel had a long-knife held right up against Gil\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck. She started to scrape it up and down against Gil\u8217\'92s throat, and the poor beast, eager to get in a good scratch, had his eyes closed and tilted his head up to make sure Soreel could scratch the whole length of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now that\u8217\'92s unnecessary,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said. \u8220\'93Let Gil be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ll come then?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then I\u8217\'92m going to offer Gil up to Sol.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now hold on!\u8221\'94 Pyetle shouted. Soreel stayed her hand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you care if I go or not?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel lowered her blade and looked at Pyetle throught}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pyetle, you know the Salavan didn\u8217\'92t get to be Salavan by letting his people disobey him. He ordered me down here, and he ordered me to punish you if you didn\u8217\'92t come. So if I don\u8217\'92t punish you then a punishment comes down on me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just let it go, my gods. Walk away and Gil and I will walk the other.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know, Salavan\u8217\'92s idea of punishment was to kill you. But I think he\u8217\'92d agree that the ox will be enough.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Just leave him be. Kill me, I don\u8217\'92t care.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t be ridiculous. I\u8217\'92m not going to kill a man over a debt when I can just kill a beast.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you going to come with me?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreel shrugged, then cupped Gil\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s snout under one arm and reached around his neck with her other. Pyetle watched in horror as she plunged her blade into his ox\u8217\'92s flesh. She\u8217\'92d done it tight up against his jaw and then immediately started to pull the blade round to the other side, but before she\u8217\'92d gotten halfway Gil let out a powerful bellow, deep and pitching, and then his  whole bulk lurched backwards, pulling his head out from her grasp. He leapt to his feet, knocked Soreel on her ass, and then bolted off into the field, bleeding and bleating as he went. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He only got thirty meters or so when he started to slow. Then he stopped altogether. It was as if he looked out into the distance and realized he had nowhere to go. He stood there for a moment, head bowed and blood pouring down into the earth, and then he looked back in confusion towards Pyetle and Soreel, looked back just in time to see his old master smashing in the side of Soreel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s skull with a five pound rock. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The woman crumpled to the ground.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle had never killed anyone before. He was shocked at how easy her skull had caved in. She lay there, eyes open but motionless. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle reached down and picked up the her knife, then marched over to where Gil was still standing. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 By now Gil\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cries of pain and terror had ceased. Spittle ran thick and red from his mouth, and his chest heaved with every labored breath.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle sidled up to him, calming hand outstretched. Gil let him come, and }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t worry Gil. I\u8217\'92ve got you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With a quick jerk Pyetle finished Soreel\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cut, and Gil collapsed in kind. In a few more moments he was well and truly dead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle looked at the bloody blade in his hand. It was iron, long and skinny, and it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hilt was brownwood patterned with innumerable dots of tin. If it could kill an ox, it could kill Salvan Saran.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then he set off for Mudwater.}
