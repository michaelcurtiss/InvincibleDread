\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Few features of the earth have drawn more debate than the Great Soldgi Erg. It is a sea of sand that blankets the eastern rib of the Jandrian continent, and people who grow up within sight of it grow up with the story of how those monstrous dunes came to be. Every time the story is told some details are added, some forgotten, and sometimes even the heart of it will change. The only thing that everyone agrees upon is that Sol made those mountains of sand a long time ago, back when he walked the earth alone, and that is why it is called the Great Soldgi Erg. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 So when Pyetle asked the scribe Soreen if she believed the story about how the Erg was made, she could only scratch her head and ask, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Which story do you mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The two were sharing the shade of a cedar tree with Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s yellow ox. The three of them together had been lazing about all day long, content to watch the sun bake the barren field around them - barren, for the field was white and ridden with salt. The only thing that would grow for miles around was the lonesome cedar tree under which they sat, and the only thing that moved amidst this desolation were the flies that buzzed around the ox\u8217\'92s ringed snout. The Soldgi Erg itself was nothing but a hazy red blur that rimmed the horizon one hundred miles away to the south.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m talking about the story that says it was all an accident,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the story I like.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Erg was an accident? I haven\u8217\'92t heard that one,\u8221\'94 Soreen said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s the first story about Sol I can remember. I must have been about, I don\u8217\'92t know\u8230\'85 four when I first heard it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe that\u8217\'92s why I don\u8217\'92t know it,\u8221\'94 Soreen said. She absently brushed the skinny ox against which she lay. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re so old that by the time I got around to being me, I bet that story had had stopped getting told.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle smiled. He took another sip of his first mash. It was his own concoction, a milky-white brew that was laden with spirits. He could feel the weight of the drink settling in, and that helped him to relax into his little nook of the tree. He smiled when he was drunk. He was a lively drunk. In fact the drunker he got the more intelligible he got, but that was mostly because he mumbled when he was sober. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He could feel Soreen looking at him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How\u8217\'92s the story go?\u8221\'94 Soreen asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The story of the Erg\u8217\'92s creation. You said it was an accident.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well the story goes that Sol wanted to build a garden to cover all the land.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh that\u8217\'92s just like -\u8220\'93}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t interrupt when I\u8217\'92m telling a story.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell it then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle paused a moment to wet his throat again. All was quiet save for the ox\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s steady snore and the rustling of the branches as the wind shook them. And that wind was cool so it was comfortable there in the dappled light of the cedar\u8217\'92s shade. Pyetle sighed and continued on with his story. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Now, to begin this great work, Sol planted a stick in the ground just south of here to mark one of the garden\u8217\'92s six corners. He then left to gods-knows-where to measure out the rest of it. Well, that stick in the ground, it was nothing but a cedar branch.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle pointed to one of the larger boughs above him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sol planted that stick in the ground. Then he left. Then in a few days a little embryo of a sand dune built up in that stick\u8217\'92s lee. See it was all by accident. That\u8217\'92s the important bit. By accident. By accident Sol }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 happened}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to put the stick in just the right spot, and it was left alone for just long enough, that the little hump of sand in the stick\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s lee grew and grew. It grew wide and tall and in no time at all the first sand dune was born.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93By accident?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An accident. Sure. Why not?  Surely he didn\u8217\'92t mean to turn fertile earth into mountains of sand. And that\u8217\'92s what happened. While Sol was off laboring in the middle of gods-knows-where, shaping rivers, mountains, and fields and whatnot, that little dune got large enough to sustain itself. Large enough to not be blown away by the first squall that blew in from the coast. Years passed and the Istil wind - the same wind blowing now - it stretched that dune south and east all the way to the southern tip of Corin. It also grew tall, so tall that it rippled the wind and created a kind of nursery for neat little rows of dunes behind it. Those littler dunes would grow and grow. They covered the land in all directions. And so them dunes over there came to be. The Great Soldgi Erg.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think that\u8217\'92s, uh, not how it happened.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So you don\u8217\'92t believe it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It wasn\u8217\'92t an accident. Sol doesn\u8217\'92t make accidents.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s more. Maybe you could say, it gets worse. You see, Sol didn\u8217\'92t return to this corner of the world for five hundred years. When he had put that stick in the ground, that earth over there was spongy and black. It was good earth. Not like this salty shit that I\u8217\'92ve got. And when he returned to the land it was just gone. Only sand. As you can imagine, he was dismayed. He reasoned that clearing the sand was such a task that he just decided not to do it. So he simply gave up. Not just the Soldgi Erg, but the whole garden project altogether.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreen was incredulous. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He just, gave up?\u8221\'94 she asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle nodded. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He did. That\u8217\'92s why instead of a bountiful garden, the whole of Jandria is a desert.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not what happened.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh? Were you there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Were you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am old.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreen smirked. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Everyone knows that the Soldgi Erg }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  part of the garden. Sol knows the Istil wind. He knows the appetite of the sand. He made them. He pulled the Erg up from the earth.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle spat a little spittle onto the ground. The earth was so dry and caked by the sun, as hard as fired clay, that the spit just lingered there on the surface. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You sound just like one of Sol\u8217\'92s itinerants,\u8221\'94 he said. He then stood up and assumed a pose that he thought resembled one of the traveling preachers. Chin up, hand stretching out to the heavens, he began to preach in kind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93See how Sol\u8217\'92s golden light shimmers across the mountains of sand. No sweet smelling rose or spiraling poppy could ever match such beauty.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreen groaned. Pyetle took another swig of his mash. He stumbled a little bit as he tilted his head back to let thick brew run clean down his throat. He wiped his lips with his arm as he finished, then nearly spat on Soreen as he charged what he thought was her ignorance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you ever actually been down to the Erg? Climbed one of the dunes? I doubt you could even do it. Aside from being utterly exhausting, the view is really nothing special. \u8216\'91Ooooh, a big pile of sand! How wonderful! Praise the maker!\u8217\'92\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think it\u8217\'92s pretty.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I mean see it once, sure, but really the best thing about it is the sky. And the sky is\u8230\'85 the sky. Its everywhere.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Prettier than here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course it\u8217\'92s prettier than here. Anywhere is prettier than here. My wonderful field is nothing.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle eyed his work with and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Looks just like a sweat-stained shirt.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It does, doesn\u8217\'92t it. You had to work thirty hard years to mess it up that badly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thirty-two.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well lets get to talking about it then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, please, don\u8217\'92t start.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why do you think I\u8217\'92m here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To drink my mash, waste the day, and get paid for it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, that\u8217\'92s why I\u8217\'92ve stayed as long as I have. I am actually }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 supposed }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 to be here. Negotiating.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Negotiating?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s gaze was upturned to the sky, trying to measure out the movement of the sun. She said, \u8220\'93I suppose if we head out now it will be dark when we get back.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 We}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 ?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. Here\u8217\'92s the thing Pyetle\u8230\'85 you\u8217\'92re going to have to come back with me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not much of a negotiation.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Three months ago you were sixty-two thousand fingers in debt. Then you leased this poor ox here. Now you\u8217\'92re sixty-four thousand fingers in debt.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nonsense.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you even use the ox for anything?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He kept me company.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You leased an ox for company?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can have him back.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pyetle, you are }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 sixty-four-thousand fingers }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 in debt.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And soon I\u8217\'92ll be sixty-five.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Actually I looked; you turned fifty-five just yesterday.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did I?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In all of Mudwater, there\u8217\'92s only seventy-seven people older than you. And judging by the way you\u8217\'92re going with that mash, let\u8217\'92s be honest, you\u8217\'92re not gonna be on that list for too long.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m healthy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look, even if you had the time you wouldn\u8217\'92t be able to make it up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How\u8217\'92s that?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreen laughed and gestured to the nothingness around them. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Your field is done,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not worth the time it takes to walk across it. But what\u8217\'92s got the scribblers really worried is that you\u8217\'92ve got no kids so there\u8217\'92s no one else to work off your debt. If you up and die in the next few years without paying it back, then some scrawny prick back in Mudwater is really gonna get it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So you\u8217\'92re going to be put up for lease.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle burped. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreen chuckled and stood up, brushing off her sleeves as she did. Her little stir woke up the ox, and he mooed in irritation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are coming too,\u8221\'94 Soreen said to the ox. \u8220\'93Everybody up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not going,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said firmly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You only have one other option. This is the negotiation part.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Since you seem to have a general disdain for all things living, how do you feel about killing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re supposed to sell yourself here. Not sell yourself. I mean, to avoid having to literally sell yourself, you need to at least act like you\u8217\'92re interested.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do I get in return?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re kidding me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. What do I get?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You get to avoid spending the last years of your life slaving away in someone else\u8217\'92s field.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I feel like it should be obvious that I\u8217\'92m quite content to sit here and die. I\u8217\'92ve been drinking hard stuff straight for two days, and that was\u8230\'85 three days ago. \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93In that case, you can work it off in the brewery.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, that I can do!\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know you can. You would have all the mash you handle, and more. But you\u8217\'92d have to work. Work and drink until the end of your days.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If that\u8217\'92s your offer, I\u8217\'92d work as hard as I did in mine own field. Plus, I\u8217\'92d make the brews better, too! I\u8217\'92ve learned a lot out here on my own. If you put a little date syrup in with the barley when -\u8220\'93}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t sell me on your beer, Pyetle. That\u8217\'92s not what you\u8217\'92re being asked to do. Dying in the brewhouse will be your sad reward. Your end of the deal is to kill someone. So how do you feel about killing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Killing who?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Salavan Saran.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Saran!? You want him dead?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Soreen looks disappointed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I mean, he\u8217\'92s a big man, in every sense. Why get me to kill him? Surely you\u8217\'92d hire a professional.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because if things go wrong, we\u8217\'92d rather it be a drunk who is caught instead of a hired blade.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But he\u8217\'92s a friend, Soreen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is he? Then where is he? Here you are, a hairs breadth from suicide, and I don\u8217\'92t see a friend in sight.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, he\u8217\'92s not a friend\u8230\'85 but tell me, what did he do to warrant such a fate?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t get as rich as Salavan Saran without doing dirty things. If he were an honest man, like you, this is what he\u8217\'92d get. This field right here is what you get for being an honest, hardworking person. He took his, and by Sol\u8217\'92s light, it\u8217\'92s time you took yours too. If anyone\u8217\'92s earned the right to spend his final days drowning in beer, it\u8217\'92s you.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m headed out. Are you coming?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle quaffed down the rest of his drink, then stood up, stretched his arms, and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. I\u8217\'92m coming.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Good. When we get in I\u8217\'92ll send a man to tell Salavan that you want to sell him your fields. That will get you into his house, I\u8217\'92m sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But how do I kill him without getting caught.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Here\u8217\'92s a knife. If you get caught, kill yourself, or we\u8217\'92ll send a man to the jail to do it for you.\u8221\'94}
