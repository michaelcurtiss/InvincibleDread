\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Fynbos (fine bush) in south africa. Included among the plants o fthe fynbos is a flower called watsonia, a member of the lily family. Like its relative the gladiolus, it has a sizable corm, or bubl, which in the case of watsonia is edible.

The structures were probably framed with birch or willow poles and roofed with mammoth hide, non of which has been preserved. What survived were the walls built of mammoth bones stacked to the roof. Dewlling 1 was made from 95 lower jaws of mammoths, laid chin down using a herringbone pattern. The building of dwelling 4 alternated layers of chin-up and chin-down mandibles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hunters used mammoth tusk ivory to make figurines, pendants, bracelets, and scrimshawed plaques. Most remarkable, however, was monumental work of art found in dwelling 1.
