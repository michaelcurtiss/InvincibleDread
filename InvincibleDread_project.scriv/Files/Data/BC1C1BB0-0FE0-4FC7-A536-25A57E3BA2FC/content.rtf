Like its relative the gladiolus, it has a sizable corm, or bubl, which in the case of watsonia is edible. When fynbos vegetation is deliberatly burned off, watsonia grows back with its density per acre increased five to ten times. It seems the occupants of the region had disocvered this fact.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The plant collectors at wadi kubbaniya had learned that during october and november the nut grass tubers were small and tender; by february and march they had grown larer and harder and were filled with bitter alkaloids. Even these mature tubers, however, could be rendered edible by grinding them on stones and roasting them. }

The structures were probably framed with birch or willow poles and roofed with mammoth hide, non of which has been preserved. What survived were the walls built of mammoth bones stacked to the roof. Dewlling 1 was made from 95 lower jaws of mammoths, laid chin down using a herringbone pattern. The building of dwelling 4 alternated layers of chin-up and chin-down mandibles.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hunters used mammoth tusk ivory to make figurines, pendants, bracelets, and scrimshawed plaques. Most remarkable, however, was monumental work of art found in dwelling 1.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rosseau felt that to understnd the origins of inequality, one had to go back to a long-ago time when nature providded all human needs, and the only differences among individuals lay in their strength agility, and intelligence. People had both \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91anarchic freedom\u8217\'92 (no government or law) and \u8216\'91personal freedonm\u8217\'92 (no sovereign master or immediate superior). Individuals of that time, which rousseau called the \u8216\'91state of nature\u8217\'92, displayed self-respect but eschewed self-love. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Most anthropologists do not like the phrase \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91state of nature\u8217\'92. They do not believe in a time when archaic modern humans had so little culture that their behavior was directed largely by nature. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The netsilik eskimo of the central canadian arctic believed that earth had always existed. During mythological time, however, humans lived in perpetual darkness like that of hte arctic winter - no sunlight, no animals, and no pleasure o r suffering existed. Then nuliajuk, an orphan girl pushed from a kaya, sank to the ocean bottom and became mistress of the sea. She then create all animals, all hard work, and all pleasure.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 During this primordial era, both humans and animals could speak, and there was little difference between them. Finally the arctic hare cried out for \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91day\u8217\'92, and there was light; but day was forced to alternate with night, because the nocturnal arctic fox cried out for \u8216\'91darkness\u8217\'92. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At first there were no netsilik, only the tunrit, or \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91old ones\u8217\'92, superhuman beings who rendered the land uninhabitable. The tunrit left when the netsiliik arrived, but not before they had invented the leister for spearing fish, the long stone walls for driving caribou on foot, the weir for fishing, and the craft of hunting caribou from cayaks. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 In the cosmology of the netsilik, a gradual process of differentiation created deities, humans, and animals out of porimordial chaos. Pleasure and suffering were established to give life meaning. With the crystallization of the visible world came the establishment of moral order, a series of prohibitions to control wickedness and promote restraint.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Because humans and animals had breath, they could interact with the spirit of the air, giving htem more power than plants or rocks. The difference between humans and animals was that humans had names; ones name was so magical that it made oe superior to a caribou or seal. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Like many foraging societies, the eskimo believed that humans would be reincarnated. They were stoic in the face of death because they saw it as a recycling of the sould from one body to another. An occasional elderly eskimo, tired of the struggle against hunger and cold, took his or her own life, confident  of returning as a newborn. So strong was this belief that babies might be given the name of a deceased elder, or even referred to as grandmother or grandfather.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Eskimos loved children, but in a land where starvation was endemic, their belief in reincarnation made infanticide a pragmatic decision in a time of stress. When a family knew that it could not aford another mouth to feed, it might simply leave a newborn outside to freeze - in effect, saying to its spirit, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91please come back later; this is not a good time.\u8217\'92 This act was performed before the infant had been named, so that the recycled spirit within it would not be insulted; indeed, without the magic of a name, the tiny creature was not yet human. }

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 During famins, all food was shared with neighbors . After a successful hunt, the actual slayer of each caribou was identified by the markings on his arrow.

When two adult hunters became habitual partners, they often arranged for tehir sons to be future partners. If one partner were to die, he could be replaced by someone with the same personal name. This act followed logically from the premise that any two people who shared the same name were magically linked.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was not the intrinsic value of the gift that mattered. The real value of hxaro was that it created a network of partners, often living up to 50 miles away, whose camps one could visit in times of scarcity.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 We wonder if clanless hunters, forbidden by society from accumulating surplus food, may instead have been accumulating social obligations.

First are the ultimate sacred propositions, beliefs considered irrefutable despite the fact that there is no empirical evidence to support them. These propositions direct the second component, ritual, which must be performed repeatedly and correctly in order to achieve its goals.

Because this experience deeply stirs the emotions, it verifies teh sacred propositions in a way that cold, hard logic never could. }
