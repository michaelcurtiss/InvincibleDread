\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Remove a column supporting a roof, and theres no longer compression - you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve got a zone of tensile stress, where the material above the tunnel is trying to pull away from itself. Many materials react differently to tension that compression, and soil and rock are no different. Soil has lotsofstrength against compression, but none against tension. You can\u8217\'92t make a rope out of soil. It has no tension strength.  So if you build a tunnel in soil, you have to replace the column you removed with some other way to transfer the load of the tension above. Rock does have tensile strength. You could make a rope from it. Rocks have breaks, cracks, jointing. Natural jointing follow specific patterns that can be mapped. Rocks that are whole are called massive. Jointed rocks have no tensile strength- the\u8217\'92ll fall right out.}}
