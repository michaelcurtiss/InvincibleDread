\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 When Sober, Pyetle would take the opportunity to wallow in his depression. Sober as he was, and stuck in the Ayramun\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s pit cave, he had little else to do, so he closed his eyes and conjured up the memory which would not let him be: the memory of his father marching out into the Sand.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle could still recall the excitement of the day. All of Drissel had turned out to see his father off because the prospect that Sol\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s Stone could be found by the men of their town was a point of local pride. It was also a holiday, the twelfth of Zun - Sol\u8217\'92s birthday. That meant all the little boys got to chase the Great Demon Damdramood through the streets. Even though Pyetle was only ten, and small for a ten-year-old, it was he who tackled Damdramood and knocked the prop stone out of his hands. As part of the celebrations, he gave the stone to his father. His father joked that now he didn\u8217\'92t have to go, since Sol\u8217\'92s Stone was sitting right there in his hands.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 His father was marching under the command of a pale Imperial prince, and they were marching out to the Inner Mountain to find. His father was twenty-eight. The pale Imperial prince who rode at the head was just fourteen. Pyetle waved and waved until he couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t distinguish his father\u8217\'92s white silhouette from the rest of the expedition. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Later that day, a smithy  could remember those telling him how legendary his father would be, how proud he should be. But Pyetle had reached that age where people arent sure how much the child really understands, how much he really sees, so the didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t make any around him to hide their jesting comments of doubt, their smiles and about open positions here there, fresh opportunities for advancement. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It was then he realized that no one thought his father would make it back. He didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle had no more tears for this memory. He\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d already cried at every part of it. At the _. At teh _. And that\u8217\'92s what made so effective as a depressing instrument; it was a long drawn note that had lost it\u8217\'92s soul. IT could no longer stir the fire inside of him. At this age, it had finally pulled it all out. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Out in the sand, Pyetle\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s story wasn\u8217\'92t an uncommon one. He looked at around at the rest of the Ayramun, at their strange deformities, and wondered just how bad they\u8217\'92d had it as kinds. That tempered the mood. He had spent his long life feeling sorry for himself , but now, stuck as he was in the cold shadow of the Ayramun\u8217\'92s pit cave, he felt a little guilty about it. Only a little, though. All the other Ayramun had clothes and leathers to keep out the cold breath of the Underworld as it crept into the pit cave. All Pyetle had was Hill\u8217\'92s cloak. The thin, ragged tunic he\u8217\'92d gotten from Salavan\u8217\'92s wasn\u8217\'92t doing a thing.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 When he asked if he could climb up and out of the cave so that he could get warm, Hill had said no; no one was allowed to leave until dusk for fear of being spotted by Imperial eyes. Pyetle wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t allowed a fire for the same reason. Hill told him to just bear it. \u8220\'93This the life of us Ayramun,\u8221\'94 he had said. \u8220\'93And it not so bad. You not complain earlier?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Hill left before Pyetle could explain that the reason he didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t complain earlier was because he drunk, so when the icy breath of the Underworld chilled his fingers and toes he couldn\u8217\'92t ignore it. His sobriety was making him regret the whole situation, so he decided to scan the cave for signs of alcohol.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 But before Sob could finish explaining that the stone\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s got to be part of the test, that it\u8217\'92s got to be thrown or stabbed or something, he was interrupted by a bird whistle fluttering down from above. It was a soft little twitter, nothing obnoxious, the kind of thing Pytele would\u8217\'92ve brushed off if Moteah and Sob didn\u8217\'92t look like they\u8217\'92d just heard a divine command. Even when the twittering died down, the two kept their eyes skyward, clearly expecting something more. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t take long for Pyetle to put two and two together: this wasn\u8217\'92t some rare desert bird peeking in, tweeting warnings that big mammals were near the nests and holes; it was an Ayramun signal. It had come from one of the scout\u8217\'92s up above, a near perfect imitation of the real thing.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle looked around at the rest of the Ayramun - they were all awake, alert, and silent. Most had their heads craned upwards like Sob and Moteah. All were clearly expecting another message.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 When nothing came, Sob broke the silence.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You might just get your wish, Pyetle.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle was about to ask what he meant, but Moteah shushed him.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Then another tweeted song came floating down. This one, Pyetle recognized.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s a purple starling,\u8221\'94 he said under his breath.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah nodded. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93An Imperial starling.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Just as the words were out of her mouth, the cave went abuzz with whispers and ruffled movement. Here and there, Ayramun rushed to roll up their tarps and padded skins. Some simply dropped whatever they were doing and started to climb up and out of the cave. Hill was one of them. He and a few others free-climbed up the wall via series of ledges. Even though they carried bags up with them, strapped to their backs, they kept a clean, steady pace. Pyetle assumed they\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d done this hundred\u8217\'92s of times, this particular climb. There were no searching hands or feet, they just floated up the rock-face. Once at the top, they disappeared.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well ain\u8217\'92t that interestin\u8217\'92,\u8221\'94 Sob said as he finished bundling the clothes that Pyetle wasn\u8217\'92t using. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re stone is either the luckiest in the world, or the unluckiest. Might just be cursed.\u8221\'94 He looked up at Pyetle with excitement. \u8220\'93Needs more testin\u8217\'92, don\u8217\'92t it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What do you mean?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What do I mean? Gods man, no wonder you\u8217\'92ve not got a grasp of luck, even when it slaps you in the face.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93This is just coincidence,\u8221\'94 Moteah said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not like a bunch of Imperials popped into existence as soon as Pyetle wished to get out of this cave. }
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ql\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Coincidence?\u8221\'94 Sob said. \u8220\'93The man says he wants to get up and out o\u8217\'92 this hole, and next thing comes, and its up and out o\u8217\'92 this hole he\u8217\'92s gettin\u8217\'92. \u8216\'91}{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 Just a coincidence\loch\af2\hich\af2\dbch\af2\uc1\u8217\'92, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Listen to yerself.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Seems like good luck to me,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said, smiling.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Now hold on there.\u8221\'94 Sob said. \u8220\'93Might not be }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 good}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  luck. It\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s not sunshowers and sugarplumbs drivin\u8217\'92 us out o\u8217\'92 this hole. It\u8217\'92s a herd of Imps marchin\u8217\'92 straight towards us. On horseback no less.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Horseback?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked. \u8220\'93You got all that from a tweeting bird?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Aye,\u8221\'94 Sob said. \u8220\'93The count, too. Roughly fifty of \u8216\'91em.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93This is just a precaution,\u8221\'94 Moteah assured Pyetle. \u8220\'93What they\u8217\'92ve spotted up there, some company of Imperials, they\u8217\'92re still a long ways off. They don\u8217\'92t know that we\u8217\'92re here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93As may be,\u8221\'94 Sob said. \u8220\'93But that don\u8217\'92t mean they ain\u8217\'92t lookin\u8217\'92 for us, \u8216\'91cause they\u8217\'92re definitely lookin\u8217\'92 for him!\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Sob pointed to Mazyd.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Are they?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They\u8217\'92re on horseback. Riding out into the Sand. I\u8217\'92d wager more than money that\u8217\'92s a search party. Only people Imps care about are those damned Seilsi.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s ridiculous,\u8221\'94 Moteah said. \u8220\'93Sand\u8217\'92s too big to search like that. Horses don\u8217\'92t do well out on Charnel Roads.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s just the thing. Makes no sense to be out on horses in this heat unless they know exactly where they\u8217\'92re goin\u8217\'92. And what\u8217\'92s out here for them to find? Nothin\u8217\'92 but us!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah cast a wary eye at Mazyd. She didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 think}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  it was possible for the Imperials to know where they were, but she\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d heard stories about the Seilsi like all the rest. Mazyd didn\u8217\'92t have hands, but there might be some hidden magic}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Regardless, she didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t argue any further with Sob. There wasn\u8217\'92t any time. So, she made to help Sob wrap up his things. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The sight of Moteah helping Sob was strange to Pyetle. Just moments ago, Moteah looked like she wanted to kill the man any way she could, now, she was gathering up his things - a pipe, a scattered bunch of tresla, sandspit - and putting them into a larger leather sack. Pyetle chalked this kindness up to the urgency of the moment, but he wondered if it wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t a sense of kinship driving it.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Most of the others were already finished gathering up their things because they didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t have much, and what they did have was made to be quickly folded and packed in sacks. These sacks had corded loops for easy hauling, and already some of them were being pulled up and out of the cave with ropes. The rest of the things to be hauled out were being lined up at the foot of the wall. Among them were the tarred leather bags packed with foodstuffs, the waterskins, bundles of bows and arrows wrapped in cotton sheets, and Mazyd, all wrapped up in his new cloak.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 When Mazyd\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s turn to be hauled up came, the rope was wrapped around his chest and groin. Mazyd\u8217\'92s new leathers took the brunt of the biting rope, but as he ascended up into the air, he would bounce and scrape against the rockface. He couldn\u8217\'92t do anything about it because his arms were tied up against his sides.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah was watching him go up, wincing all the while. When Mazyd was finally, roughly, pulled over the top, and the rope was thrown back down, she told Pyetle he was next.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Can\u8217\'92t I just climb up it?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked as she started to tie the rope around him. She couldn\u8217\'92t answer because she had to use her mouth to hold one end of the rope steady as she wrapped it around him. Only after she was done, and before she tied him in with a knot, did she entertain Pyetle\u8217\'92s fear.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You think you can climb this?\u8221\'94 she asked. \u8220\'93Do you even know how to climb a rope?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You just\u8230\'85 climb it, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No. There\u8217\'92s no time for this. This will be safer, believe me. It\u8217\'92ll be easier. I don\u8217\'92t think you can climb it, anyways.\u8221\'94 She then looped the rope around each leg and knotted it tight around shoulder blades. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re skinny as hell.\u8221\'94 She then gave three tugs on the rope and Pyetle began to rise.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 But Pyetle\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s weight wasn\u8217\'92t centered on the rope, so as soon as he was hoisted up into the air he started to spin. It wasn\u8217\'92t a violent spin, but it was undignified nonetheless, and it was just enough to prevent him from catching himself against the rock-face with his hands and feet, meaning with each tug upwards he\u8217\'92d bump and scrape against the sandstone, just like Mazyd.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 And upwards he went. It didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t take long because whoever was pulling him was clearly intent on being done with the whole ordeal as soon as possible. When Pyetle\u8217\'92s head finally breached the surface, he found that there were two men pulling him up. Both black as Moteah. One of them was missing an arm, just like Moteah. The other, upon seeing Pyetle\u8217\'92s bald head pop out of the ground, nearly dropped the rope in surprise.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh shit! Gammel, stop! It\u8217\'92s a person!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93But the Seilsi already up here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s the new guy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh. Right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You hold steady. I\u8217\'92ll help him up. You got it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93He light as air.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah. I thought he was a bundle of dried pilk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The nearest man, the two armed man, he dropped the rope and stepped over to the lip of the cave where Pyetle hung half-in, half-out.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Sorry bout the rough pull,\u8221\'94 the man said with a deep Zozan lilt. \u8220\'93I thought you were a bundle of dried pilk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He then grabbed the part of the rope which was wrapped around Pyetle\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s chest, and with one forceful yank, he pulled Pyetle out of the cold shadow of the cave and in into the Sand.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It was still afternoon, so the ground was still hot. Pyetle wanted to just lay there and revel in it, but the Zozan who had pulled him out was already fiddling with the knots that kept Pyetle bound to his rope.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Roll over,\u8221\'94 the Zozan commanded. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle did as he was told. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, and I\u8217\'92m Zouga,\u8221\'94 the man said. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re Pyetle, right? Well that man there is Gammel.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Gammel waved. He only had one arm.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Zouga\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s deformity was clear as well: his upper lip was cleft in two. It wasn\u8217\'92t nearly as bad as some Pyetle had seen, where the whole upper jaw is split, but nonetheless, Zouga\u8217\'92s front teeth were permanetly fixed into a grin. Zouga had filed them down to a point so they stood out from his face like fangs, just like the lizard brothers.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93This isn\u8217\'92t a good look, my friend,\u8221\'94 Zougaz said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What? Is something wrong?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Not a good look if you can\u8217\'92t pull your own weight, friend. Literally can\u8217\'92t do it. I joke, but really, not a good look.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Sorry.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t mind. I don\u8217\'92t care. Everyone else will get all pissy. Got to pull your own weight around here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t weigh that much.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Zougaz\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s smile seemed more like a snarl. He pulled the tangle of rope out from Pyetle\u8217\'92s tangle of bones. \u8220\'93Right. You\u8217\'92re small. Very small. Still, what do you do? Some of us have got a little bet going. Gammel\u8217\'92s got you down as a thief, seeing as we picked you up near Mudwater.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Gammel groaned in disbelief. Zouga\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s smile went even wider. It was horrific.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a cook, aren\u8217\'92t you?\u8221\'94 Zouga said. \u8220\'93I bet you know all the herbs from here to Changrala. I learned a lot from the last cook we had. He could do up a lizard just right.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m a terrible cook.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Not a cook?\u8221\'94 Zouga\u8217\'92s shoulders slumped. \u8220\'93Why\u8217\'92d Ayram pick you up then?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t know,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Zouga threw the rope back down into the cave and reassumed his position next to Gammel.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I know beans.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You know beans?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I know bean-curd.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You farm?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93A little. I mostly paid others to do the farming. For me it was more the buying and selling. Back in Mudwater I leased land and would buy the kelly-beans grown on it, and then -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Wait, wait, wait, wait,\u8221\'94 Gammel said. \u8220\'93People leased the land from you, and then you bought the product right back? You suckered those shits into growing your beans? For free?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not as simple as that,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It sounds simple.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You couldn\u8217\'92t turn a profit? You get your product free and you still couldn\u8217\'92t turn a profit?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I said its not that simple.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How is that not simple?\u8221\'94 Gammel asked. \u8220\'93You sell the land and get money, buy the beans and lose money, then sell the beans and get money. That\u8217\'92s two get moneys and one lose moneys.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Like I said -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t expect me to believe you leased the land for so little that you couldn\u8217\'92t recoup the cost. How the hell could screw up being a landlord?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t want to be rude, but it\u8217\'92s not really your business.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Not yours either, evidently. And it\u8217\'92s not like this place is bean country. It\u8217\'92s not buying and selling country either. It\u8217\'92s all killing and stealing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93And the land owns itself,\u8221\'94 Zouga added. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Gammel nodded in agreement. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Damn right it does. Fences and walls don\u8217\'92t last out here. Can\u8217\'92t imagine what use Ayram saw in a scrawny little leech.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93And what are you, Gammel?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m a straight-up thief.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93A thief?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Not much more than a leech yourself, then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Zouga and Gammel looked at eachother and laughed. Then Zouga narrowed his eyes at Pyetle and said, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Gammel\u8217\'92s no leech old man. He doesn\u8217\'92t steal for himself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What, he steals for you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93For all the Ayramun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93But that just makes all of you leeches, doesn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93All men are leeches. Only the land produces.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s kind of what I\u8217\'92m trying to say. I don\u8217\'92t get why he\u8217\'92s being so sanctimonious about how I made my living back in Mudwater.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not being sanctimonious,\u8221\'94 Gammel said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s like Zouga said, you need to pull your own weight out here. Can\u8217\'92t be expecting other people to do work while you sand there mouthing about.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Zouga grunted. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What are you doing }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 right now}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 ?\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyelte leaps into action. Grabs the cord in between Zouga and Gammel. \line Gammel upon seeing this laughs and drops his end of the rope.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Zouga laughed. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92ll learn, eh? You can teach him, Gammel. Oh, wait! Stop!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 They stopped hauling the rope.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What is it?\u8221\'94 Gammel asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s another person.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s Moteah.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle looked towards the big hole in the ground, and sure enough, the top of Moteah\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s head was there, bobbing up and down.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Eager to seem useful, Pyetle rushed over to pull her up, but Moteah was already climbing out, so he just knelt there and looked ready-to-help while she mantled the lip of the cave. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The hell are you doing, woman?\u8221\'94 Gammel asked. \u8220\'93Climb like the rest of us. I\u8217\'92ve got things to pull.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t respond. Instead she undid the knot of rope around her chest, and then threw the length of it back down into the cave. Then she stood up and dusted herself off, all the while pretending not to notice that she\u8217\'92d pissed Gammel off. This, of course, pissed Gammel off more.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Woman!\u8221\'94 Zouga shouted. \u8220\'93I asked you a question!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah ignored him. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Alright Pyetle,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93Time to get a move on. Ayram needs to see you. Come on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 But Zouga wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t about to let her leave. He dropped his rope and stomped over to her.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah gave him a glare. After a tense moment, he spat, and returned to the rope to continue hauling. There, the only thing he could do to Moteah was stare daggers into her back as she and Pyetle walked away.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Zouga really doesn\u8217\'92t like you, huh?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked, once they were out of earshot.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Of course not. He\u8217\'92s my brother.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Your brother!? I guess I can see that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh? How so?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Just the, uh, physical resemblance. Strange that you two are both missing arms. Opposite arms though.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s because were born joined together. He\u8217\'92s my right arm, and I\u8217\'92m his left.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You two were conjoined?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah nodded. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We were separated after birth. There wasn\u8217\'92t much connecting us. Thank the gods. He\u8217\'92s such an ass.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Is he?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yeap. I rode the rope up just to annoy him.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It is what it is. \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Are you safe from him? He\u8217\'92s got violence in his eyes. No mistaking it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t worry about me. You need to worry bout yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You sure? He seemed pretty-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pyetle, really, don\u8217\'92t worry bout me. You need to worry bout yourself. And speaking of - there are things out in the Sand that only Ayram can save you from. He won\u8217\'92t be able to save you if you haven\u8217\'92t taken the oath. Since we\u8217\'92re goin out into the Sand, you need to be taking the oath.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What does this oath involve?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It ain\u8217\'92t too painful.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a blood oath. There\u8217\'92s going to be blood.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle grimaced. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What? Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Look, we\u8217\'92ll kill you if you don\u8217\'92t do it." }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Okay\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93But you shouldn\u8217\'92t take the oath just because you don\u8217\'92t want us to kill you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle laughed.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked. \u8220\'93You got to be doing it for the right reasons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93And what reasons are those?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah shrugged. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s different for everyone.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Why did you take the oath?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s between me and Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93So I either take the oath, or you kill me. That just doesn\u8217\'92t seem\u8230\'85 Well, let\u8217\'92s say I took the oath, but I just said the words without meaning them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no words.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well, ok.... Then suppose I just went through the motions.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It ain\u8217\'92t that kind of oath. Maybe oath ain\u8217\'92t the right word. It\u8217\'92s more\u8230\'85 I don\u8217\'92t know. It\u8217\'92s hard to describe. It\u8217\'92s more like an experience.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah pointed at a hill just down the road. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93See that hill with the dead tree right on top of it? There\u8217\'92s a cave in that hill. Pella, the witch, and Ayram will be waitin\u8217\'92 inside. That\u8217\'92s where you make the oath. Don\u8217\'92t make \u8216\'91em wait long.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You aren\u8217\'92t coming?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s your oath,\u8221\'94 Moteah said. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve got other things to do."}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle watched Moteah walk back towards the pit, where the other Ayramun were strapping up for the journey ahead. On the way she stopped, picked up a rock, and rolled it around in her fingers. Pyetle wondered if she was thinking about luck. He wondered if she really thought there was no such thing. As if to give him an answer, she threw rock side-arm over a little mound.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The stone made a funny noise wherever it landed; a kind of delayed echo. It didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t bother Moteah, but Pyetle was intrigued - there seemed to be another pit. He walked over to check it out, and sure enough, a deep and wide hole opened up into the ground. Another pit cave. No one was in this one, and it didn\u8217\'92t seem to open up into the Underworld. It was just a big hole in the ground, unconnected to anything but the outside air. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It got Pyetle to wondering just where he was. In the Sand there is a place called the Pitted Portion, a place filled with sinks and holes and caves, but that was a thousand leagues from Dissel, and he couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t have made that journey in just one night.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Just to be sure, Pyetle scrambled up a little graveled hill and climbed atop a boulder to get a better view of the place. He expected to see something familiar, like the Blackshell hills or the . The Blackshells were indeed there to the east, but only their peaks, so far away that their white tips barely gleamed through the thick haze of distance. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The rocky ground all around wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t clay, it was rock. Thickly pitted for miles. Most pits weren\u8217\'92t so dramatic as the one he\u8217\'92d come out of, as most edges were sloped and sagged or cratered instead of dropping sheer into the earth. In between these holes there were wide, flat spaces of dry sandstone, but there were also great mounds of boulders and gravel, just like the one he was standing on. Undoubtedly , this was the Pitted Portion. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 No one knew how these pits came to be. There was no river running through it, nothing to carve a winding canyon. It was just like the rest of the Junei plain, only with holes and the rubble that had, presumably, once filled them. Standing there, Pyetle felt certain in Truth of the Solean Myth of Damdromidon - what else but a great demon looking for the buried heart of the earth could explain this cavernous plain?}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \hich\f1 \emdash \loch\f1  When Pyetle had looked at maps to trace the route had taken, he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d come to expect a clear delination between portions. Pitted is here and windy is there. But looking out he wondered if the pitted portion ever ended, if the names given were even useful. If the different parts of the sand were even clear enough to warrant a category, or if it was one big clusterfuck.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Then a voice shouted from the base of his little promontory.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pyetle! What are you doing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle turned in fright and saw Ayram standing there, looming large even though he was a good thirty meters away.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Just taking a look!\u8221\'94 Pyetle shouted back. \u8220\'93Is this really the Pitted Portion?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Did Moteah not make it clear to you that there are Imps about, looking for us?\u8221\'94 Ayram asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle took a quick look around for any sign of Imperial riders.  \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t see any.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Do you think that they might see you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 In his rush to scramble off the boulder, Pyetle fell butt-first onto the slope of the hill. He was able to catch himself, so instead of rolling down the scree, he slid down it. When he got to the bottom, he stood up in front of Ayram and apologized.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry. I was just curious. I\u8217\'92m not used to the whole desert bandit thing. Hiding in holes and whatnot.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram wasn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t looking at Pyetle. He was looking at the cloud of dust that Pyetle had kicked up when he slid down the scree. It was rising slowly into the air, twirling in on itself, measuring both the vortex/convective wind and the magnitude of Pyetle\u8217\'92s shame.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram shook his head.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pyetle, do people find you to be annoying? Is this kind of thing a common kind of thing with you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s jaw would have dropped at the bluntness of the question if it weren\u8217\'92t already drawn tight by embarrassment. As such, Pyetle could barely stammer out the word, \u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You need to understand something, so I\u8217\'92m going to state it clearly,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. \u8220\'93I invest in people. My people. Ayramun. And I\u8217\'92ll invest in you if you do something with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle nodded.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I haven\u8217\'92t made the point yet,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle, looking up, thought Ayram seemed inhuman. Greater than human. He was so much bigger, too big to be the same kind of thing as he.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a little careless, Pyetle. That\u8217\'92ll get you killed. There\u8217\'92s no shame in getting killed - but carelessness? Is that how you want to go?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Then keep in mind that things out here are trying to kill you. Right now they\u8217\'92re trying to kill you. Not just the Imps. Bugs. Lizards. The sun. Hell, there could be a beatboar hogging your scent. If I can smell the drink on you from here, then he can from a mile away.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram smacked his teeth, like he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d just tasted something foul. \u8220\'93Out here the kind of mistakes that require apologies are the ones that get people killed. So don\u8217\'92t ever say that. \u8216\'91I\u8217\'92m sorry\u8217\'92. Not to me. Just do better. Else I\u8217\'92ll be trying to kill you too.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I understand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t. But I have a way to make it a little clearer. Come.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle followed Ayram around the lip of the pit and back to where Moteah had left him. From there they went to the hill with the cave where he was to take his oath. The entrance to it was narrow, and it matched Pyetle\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s height, so Ayram had to duck down and shimmy sideways to get in. Pyetle stopped at the entrance, and tried to see inside.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The interior was lit by a narrow sliver of sunlight that cut down from the entrance and crawled along the floor. It was enough because the cave was small, and the light could bounce around. It was almost like the inside of sandstone ball, with Ayram standing at the far end. To his right, was Pella, hunched and. To left was the witch Elrahet. In between them, cut into the rock floor, was a round hole the width of a foot. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 When Pyetle stepped into the cave, his body cut out the light. Elrahet and Pella each grabbed a wrist, and then Ayram dropped something into the hole.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How do you feel about the Empire?\u8221\'94 Pella asked. Her grip was firm and tight, stronger than Pyetle had expected from a woman of her age.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t really care about it one way or the other,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said. He was sure that Pella had been expecting him to say he hated the Empire. All the other Ayramun seemed to. But something about the scene suggested simple honesty was the best course of action. He felt that something was considering him, sniffing him out. Some sense oustide the normal, which could target truth.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The Empire kills and it rapes,\u8221\'94 Pella replied. \u8220\'93It grinds the wealth and culture of the world to dust. Have you not seen it? Is that not why you are here among us?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle was unsure of what to say. His answer would obviously be \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91no\u8217\'92, so he didn\u8217\'92t understand why Pella was pressing the issue. She was trying to catch him out. For what reason, he couldn\u8217\'92t fathom. Maybe she just didn\u8217\'92t like him. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 In the end it was Ayram who answered Pella\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s question.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pyetle is here because he followed me here. It is as simple as that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No passion, then,\u8221\'94 Pella croaked. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Remove your shirt.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle did.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 An odor began to rise out of the hole in the ground. A green glow.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Then Elrahet stabbed in him the belly with a knife.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He doesn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t feel much. Wanted to scream but couldn\u8217\'92t. The words caught in throat, and he couldn\u8217\'92t breath. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram then reached out, grabbed his shoulder, and threw him him face down to the earth. Pyetle\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s belly, and his open wound, was flush over the hole. Then his sense started to dull. He could no longer smell the sulfur. But instead of going dark, his mind began to swim with visions. Flashes of  color, different scenes. The outlines of Ayram\u8217\'92s eyes swirling through them, part of them, edges lost but still there, watching. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91Coming to\u8217\'92 moment where ayrams true visage are loaded behind the eyes. Pyetle begins to wonder if Ayram gave him the vision or share in it. If he knew what he was thinking, etc.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 After some time, which Pyetle later learned was only a minute, Ayram pulled him up from the ground. When Pyetle searched his belly, he found there was no wound, and that in its place was the brand of the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 "Rise my child, Pyetle of the Ayraman. You have been consecrated.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Purpose of this hallucination is to hint at Ayram\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s capacity to truly end a human\u8217\'92s soul.}
