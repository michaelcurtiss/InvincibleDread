\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Not to mention, in actual fencing all parries should also be attacks, specifically to avoid similar tricks. You can do similar things with conventional blades by trying to flourish around their block. Of course, it would be possible for them to intercept such a flourish, unlike this move. But that is less efficient that just going for a strike from the beginning to punish them if they were to try something like that. The problem with this clip is the defender is blocking like an actor, not a duelist. }

\par\pard\plain \sa180\sb180\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I do quite a bit of epee and sabre fencing. Lightsaber \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93blades\u8221\'94 carry no weight, so there\u8217\'92s no reason to hold them with two hands like they do in that video. If you use one hand only, your reach vastly improves and your target area decreases.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I think if two non-Jedi humans used lightsabers, it would make most sense for it to evolve into a battle of small cuts to the weapon hand and arm (similar to epee, only with more slashing and less stabbing).}
