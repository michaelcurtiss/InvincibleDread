While Jewish mysticism is the source and primary expositor of this theory, it has achieved a ubiquitous presence not only in the writings of Kabbalists,2 but also in the works of thinkers found in the libraries of most observant Jews, who hardly consider themselves followers of Kabbalah. Clearly, for one committed to the Torah and its principles, it is not tenable to presume that so long as he is not a Kabbalist, such a belief need not be a part of his religious worldview. Is there an alternative view that is an equally authentic representation of Jewish thought on the subject? In response to this question, we will }

\par\plain {R. Moshe H\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u803\'3Fayyim Luzzatto, also known as Ramh\u803\'3Fal, writes that \u8220\'93While a Jew and a non-Jew appear exactly alike in terms of their human characteristics, from the Torah\u8217\'92s perspective, they are so greatly different as to be considered a completely different species.\u8221\'9415 Furthermore, despite the well-known Talmudic dictum that \u8220\'93The righteous of all nations have a place in the World to Come,\u8221\'9416 he comments: Only Israel will be found there, while the righteous of the nations will be given their reality only by virtue of their attachment to them. They will be subordinate to Israel as clothes are subordinate to the body. In this way they will acquire whatever good is due to them, but they are unable to acquire anything whatsoever beyond this.17 }
\par\plain 
\par\plain 
\par\plain {Obviously, the Rebbe believed in the Talmudic dictum that the righteous of all nations are awarded a place in the World to Come. He maintained, however, that their reward, warranted by exemplary behavior on some level, does not indicate that the essential nature of their souls is in any way akin to the lofty souls of Jews. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {The Rebbe further clarified his position in a discussion with Hillel students, during which he was directly asked if a non-Jew has a spark of God in him, just as a Jew does. He answered: \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93A non-Jew and every created thing does have a Divine spark, but it is not the same kind of Divine spark that a Jew has.\u8221\'9420 In other words, the Divine spark of a non-Jew is similar to that which exists within any animal, plant, or inanimate object. This is the same hierarchical theory of souls found in the Tanya. The Rebbe chose not to be apologetic and to express the true meaning of the doctrine. }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {The implications of this stance can be seen in the Rebbe\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s explanation of the famous Talmudic statement that one who converts is considered to be like a newborn baby.21 At first glance, this indicates that a non-Jew becomes a Jew when he is endowed with a completely new soul, a Jewish soul. The Rebbe notes, however, that the Talmudic statement literally reads: \u8220\'93A convert who converted (ger sh\u8217\'92nitgayer) is considered to be like a newborn baby.\u8221\'94 A person who comes to convert, the Rebbe explains, is led to that decision because he already possesses a Jewish soul, which happened to mistakenly find its way into a non-Jewish body. In accordance with the Talmudic view that all Jews, including future converts, took part in the Revelation at Sinai,22 the convert seeks not to acquire something new, but to recover what was actually his all along.23 Accordingly, the only reason a non-Jew can convert to the Jewish faith is because he was essentially never a non-Jew in the first place!24 If a person\u8217\'92s soul truly emanated from an inferior substance, as the Zohar describes non-Jewish souls, such a situation could never be rectified; he could never convert to Judaism }

\par\plain {The difference between the Jewish soul, its self, its inner desires, its overflow, its character, its standing, and that of all the nations, at all their levels, is greater and deeper than the difference between the human soul and the soul of an animal. Between the latter, there is merely a quantitative distinction; between the former, an essential qualitative distinction pertains.2 }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {The highest state of love of creatures should be allotted to the love of mankind, and it must extend to all of mankind, despite all variations of religions, opinions, and faiths, and despite all distinctions of race and climate. It is right to get to the bottom of the views of different peoples and groups, to learn, as much as possible, their characters and qualities, in order to know how to base love of humanity on foundations that approach action. For only upon a soul rich in love for creatures and love of man can the love of the nation raise itself up in its full nobility and spiritual and natural greatness. The narrowness that causes one to see whatever is outside the border of the special nation, even outside the border of Israel, as ugly and defiled, is a terrible darkness that brings general destruction upon all building of spiritual good, for the light of which every refined soul hopes.29 }

The measure of a man\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s soul is a function of his intellectual comprehension of Divinity (and the proper translation of that level of comprehension into sanctified actions): The soul of all flesh is the form that God gave him, and the greater knowledge that is found in the soul of man is the form of man who is complete in his intellect. Regarding this form, the Torah states\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0  \u8220\'93Let us make man in our form and in our likeness\u8221\'94\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that is, that he should possess the form that comprehends ideas.41 The intellect, which overflowed from Him, may He be exalted, toward us, is the bond between us and Him.42 }

It should be evident that Kabbalists\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 who are of the opinion that a non-Jew cannot carry out acts for the sake of Heaven, due to his possession of an inferior soul to that of a Jew\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0  cannot possibly entertain the thought that such an individual could achieve the spiritual level of Moses.4 }
\par\plain 
\par\plain {In the Epistle to Yemen, Maimonides leaves no doubt to his position, by listing the non-Jewish prophets who are to be rejected and those who are to be accepted: \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But we will believe in a prophet or reject him due to his prophecy, not his lineage.\u8221\'94 As a proof-text, he refers to the Book of Job, citing the prophets Job, Tzofar, Bildad, Elifaz, and Elihu, \u8220\'93who are all prophets to us,\u8221\'94 despite the fact that they were, in his opinion, not Jewish.52 He later comments with regard to the proof that is necessary to identify a prophet: \u8220\'93Should a Jewish or gentile prophet urge and encourage people to follow the religion of Moses, without adding to it or subtracting from it, like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the others, we require a miracle from him.\u8221\'94 }

\par\plain 
\par\plain 
\par\plain {The language that Maimonides employs to make this point is both intentional and dramatic.
