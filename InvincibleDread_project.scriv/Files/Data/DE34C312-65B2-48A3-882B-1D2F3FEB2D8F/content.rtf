\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It became difficult for Mandri to maintain a sense of where he was within the rock. He was shoved through so many dark and twisting passages that all he knew for sure was that he was moving away from the center. He got to thinking, after being dragged up a chubby set of stairs and bumping his head on an absurdly low-ceiling, that perhaps these Ayramun had carved out too much of the rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 From the outside, Minting Rock already looked unstable, like a macca nut resting precariously on a thimble. From the inside, that feeling of being precariously balanced was magnified, as the Ayramun had carved out most of the rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s meat, and Mandri knew they couldn\u8217\'92t have possibly carved it out in a balanced way. These weren\u8217\'92t royal architects with a trained sensitivity to the straining forces of tension and compression, these were desert folk, and like snot-nosed moles they carved out holes and tunnels and rooms according to whim. Mandri\u8217\'92s toes and fingers would often stumble upon stress cracks in the floors and walls, and in the dusty dark he was surprised to bump shoulders with an unworked wooden beam that arched up and over to keep the floor above from caving in. The fact that it was all still standing seemed a miracle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The higher up he went, the more slapdash the passages and rooms became - the floors rougher, the walls tighter, the ceiling more uneven. Eventually he was pushed into a long and narrow room that was almost exactly as tall and as wide as he was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The room\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s only access to daylight was a stippled pattern of finger-sized holes bored into the far wall. The sun didn\u8217\'92t shine directly through them, so these pinpricks of day sat on the wall illuminating nothing, like a constellation of stars. Mandri recognized the pattern they made immediately, when the dots were connected they formed an ancient stitch that defined the Old Jandri aesthetic: a circle of diamonds radiating out from a central sun rose. It was the traditional symbol of Solraheen, before the Hrkans got control of Him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Alabastron incense bottles sat on the floor near the entrance, and thin tendrils of smoke swirled up out of them. The smell of this smoke was horrible. Mandri felt like he was wading through the stench of a mound of peaches that had been left to putrefy in a muggy spring sun. It was a stench so sickly sweet that, as he was pushed further into the room by Sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s elbow, he had to breathe through his mouth to keep from gagging.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He thought, at first, that the smell was intended to trigger in him a spiritual impulse. He thought that this was some kind of prayer room and he knew that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what prayer room incense was supposed to do. He didn\u8217\'92t entertain the thought that this cloying scent was meant to mask a more rancid smell until he reached out to steady himself against the wall, and instead of slapping against rock, his fingers rubbed up against something that felt curiously like skin. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A shock of fright shot through his arm, and he recoiled his hand as quick as lightning. His eyes darted to the wall where his hand had been, but his vision hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t yet adjusted to the dimness. The only thing he could see for certain was a dark recess cut into the rock. He reached out again, but Sob slapped his hand away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep your hands to yourself,\u8221\'94 Sob commanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s in there?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t answer. He was busy dragging Mazyd Obo into the room by the wrists. Mazyd Obo, however, had resigned himself to his , and so was free to answer Mandri\u8217\'92s question. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a dead body.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sniffed the air again, and now that his nose knew what to look for, it ferreted out the tang of rotting flesh being smothered by all that incense smoke. This wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a prayer room, it was a burial chamber.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri turned to protest his new accommodation, but before he could get out a word, Sob shoved him towards the far wall.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sit down and be quiet,\u8221\'94 Sob said. His stern tone cowed Mandri into compliance. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sat down, set his back against the cold rock wall, and was about to settle in for another boring spell of captivity, when all of a sudden, Sob tossed the legless Mazyd through the dark like the once great statesman was heap of dirty laundry. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo crashed into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest, and the two fumbled around in the dark, trying to set themselves straight within the cramped confines of the sepulcher.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob tried to temper the commotion with a furious whisper. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is a sacred place,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Quit your rumbling. Don\u8217\'92t touch anything. In fact, don\u8217\'92t move at all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice came from the tunnel behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I need a light.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri heard the click of an iron striker against flint, and a moment later, a flame sputtered to life above his head. Suspended from the ceiling was a clay oil lamp, and as Sob moved away, its light splayed out on the room\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s interior, bringing the haunting sepulcher to life.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Cut into the rock walls were coffin-sized slits, three on either side, stacked one above the other. Inside each of these, resting in a peaceful repose, was a corpse. Each was in a different stage of decomposition, and each was as naked as come from the womb, and all of them, as far as Mandri could tell, were women.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The corpse he could see clearest was as dry and shriveled as a grape fallen from the vine. It was impossible to say for certain how long that body had been laying there, for an unbothered corpse in the Sand can last for an age. Cloistered away in Minting Rock, sheltered from the wind, Mandri figured that a corpse could last for as long as Solraheen willed it. These women could be as ancient as language.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But ancient corpses don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t smell, at least Mandrameen didn\u8217\'92t think they did, so he thought that one of those graves had to be recently inhumed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He eyed each grave to try and find out which one it was. None of what he could see seemed particularly fresh; a dessicated hand with purple fingers, a plaited braid of cloud-white hair, mostly he saw dry, skin-wrapped bones. No hint of bloat. No trace of the tar-like iridescence of fresh rot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri began to wonder if there really was a smell at all, and that perhaps he was just imagining it. Then he thought that perhaps ancient corpses did indeed have a smell. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d never actually seen one up close like this. He\u8217\'92d always assumed that the white-robed corpses of saints suspended from the ceilings of Solitant temples didn\u8217\'92t stink. Of course, those temples burn incense at all hours, so that whole spiel he\u8217\'92d heard about the smell triggering the source of all wonder could have just been a ruse to distract from the fact that the houses of Solraheen literally had rot and decay nailed to the rafters.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Mandri looked down and saw the spreading rot in his leg and he laughed, realizing that the smell was probably coming from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sob, move out of the way,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob grunted, then backed out of the room, and in scampered Purl. She was hunched over, clutching a bundle of goods close to her chest with her good left arm. When she got to Mandri, she knelt, then she pawed some her things onto the floor with the wristless stump of her right arm. First to drop was a clean strip of wool folded tight, then a bundle of damp leaves knotted at the stems, and finally a stone mortar hit the floor with a crack. The only things left nestled in her arm were three spool-shaped bowls that were packed to the brim with waxy substances, one yellow, one red, and one white. Purl hesitated with these, clearly not used to having only one hand, so Mandri reached out to help. He grabbed the bowls one by one, and set them down between them. Then Purl had him stretch out his leg and she rolled his wound into the light. She eyed the festering flesh with keen interest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Would ya look at that,\u8221\'94 she muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob had been standing behind her, and he hovered over her shoulder to get a look in himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re blocking the light,\u8221\'94 Purl snipped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob moved back, then cleared his grizzled throat and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t do anything yet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not?\u8221\'94 Purl asked. \u8220\'93This wound needs curing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want to question him first.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You two can talk while I\u8217\'92m working.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl pulled a thumb-sized pestle from her ragged robes, then she dolloped a two-finger-dip of each of the three waxes into her mortar.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said stop,\u8221\'94 Sob pecked. \u8220\'93Only treat him if he talks, and that\u8217\'92s provided he is convincing with the truth.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brow knit tight in dismay. She looked up at Sob as if to grasp the truth in his face, and asked \u8220\'93You want to torture him for information?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is not torture,\u8221\'94 Sob said defensively.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at his leg! He\u8217\'92s marked for death, and you want to withhold treatment?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is not torture.\u8221\'94 Sob repeated.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It might not be torture,\u8221\'94 Purl said, \u8220\'93but it\u8217\'92s something like it. It\u8217\'92s extortion, or, I don\u8217\'92t know, it\u8217\'92s not right, that\u8217\'92s what it is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not torture or extortion, Purl, it\u8217\'92s encouragement.\u8221\'94 Sob then looked to Mandri to make sure that Mandri was getting the measure of his words. \u8220\'93Tell me what you were doing in the Junei hills, and Purl will heal your wound.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl clicked her teeth and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You sound like this sparkless Mazyd. I, for one, don\u8217\'92t need anyone to tell me anything to do something decent.\u8221\'94 And with that, Purl plucked some of the leaves into the mortar, spit into it, then got to smashing that waxy substance into a paste.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t bring me into this,\u8221\'94 Mazyd Obo said.\line \tab Purl stopped her grinding. Sob raised his brow in surprise. Mandri turned to look at his wretch of a friend, who was smushed up in between his shoulder and the wall, looking upset. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no need to insult me,\u8221\'94 Obo said to Purl. \u8220\'93This man\u8217\'92s cruelty is his own, I have nothing to do with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have everything to do with it,\u8221\'94 Purl said flatly. She then continued on to smash the the leaves down into the wax, the rhythmic knead of her pestle pulping the mixture into a syrupy goo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m quite certain the only thing I\u8217\'92ve done to you Ayramun is fight in self defense. You can hardly blame me for killing your ilk when they were lobbing arrows at my throat. What would you do if some idiot is willing to blow himself up at your horses\u8217\'92 feet?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob unsheathed a sword which was hidden underneath his robe. The sudden appearance of long, curved blade startled Mandri, but Obo was unconcerned, even though the blade\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s edge threatened to split his skull in two.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That \u8216\'91idiot\u8217\'92 was my brother,\u8221\'94 Sob said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo smiled and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought he might be. He looked like a pack lizard, and here you are\u8230\'85 the resemblance is uncanny.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes lit aflame and he squeezed his sword\u8217\'92s hilt tight. \u8220\'93I wonder,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93if I cut off your tongue, would the shit still come spewing out?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, let him talk,\u8221\'94 Purl said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s good that he\u8217\'92s getting our blood up for what\u8217\'92s coming.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s coming is your deaths,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93In fact, the only way anyone in this accursed rock survives is if you treat with me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl scraped the goo out from her mortar with her fingers, and then plopped it onto the clean strip of wool. She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only way we\u8217\'92d ever treat with you, Mazyd, is if you showed the slightest scrap of humanity now and then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You want to me to slaughter seventy men, just to save your skin. Is that the \u8216\'91humanity\u8217\'92 you\u8217\'92re referring to? And oh, I might add, you people have disfigured me beyond recognition and you, Purl, mean to rob me of my will. Is that \u8216\'91humanity\u8217\'92? Am }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 I}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  the emblem of cruelty?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Without missing a beat, and with all the certainty of a child praying to Sol, Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, you are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo laughed, but Purl brushed away his disbelief with a snort, then said \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t pretend like those soldiers marching this way aren\u8217\'92t bloodthirsty, raping, brutes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93From where I sit, you Ayramun are much the same.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re nothing like them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah, forgive me, then. You are kind, caring folk who didn\u8217\'92t just chop off my legs. It must be that I have misplaced them. Sob, if you could go and take a look outside, they should be laying around somewhere out there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob lowered the tip of his sword towards Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cheek and said, \u8220\'93What Ayram did to you is a mere scratch compared to what you deserve.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl nodded in agreement. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You Mazydai have killed more innocents than drought and disease.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have we? Tell me, how many lives do you think we Mazydai have }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 saved}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  from drought and disease?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl shook her head as she slapped the gooey poultice onto Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wound. \u8220\'93You won\u8217\'92t pull me into the mud,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93I know what you are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No you don\u8217\'92t. Outside of trying to bend me to your will, you\u8217\'92ve never once spoken to me, not until now. In fact, not a single one of you Ayramun had ever spoken to a Mazyd before last week. The truth is that I have more virtues than you can even count. Certainly more than Sob can count. Can you count, Sob? Count to ten for me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rage was close to boiling over. \u8220\'93Where I\u8217\'92m from you\u8217\'92d be killed twice over already.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where I come from, someone who employs violence to deal with uncomfortable truths is called a brute.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shut up,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you, my dear, are a brute as well. A fine figured brute, but a brute nonetheless.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob flicked his wrist and sliced Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cheek. It was surface wound, but it was enough to send a trickle of blood streaming down Obo\u8217\'92s jaw.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bloodthirsty brutes,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93And what was that last indictment of yours, Purl? Raping? You could rape me, Sob, but I don\u8217\'92t think you\u8217\'92ll find my lower half in any condition to ravage. It\u8217\'92s a good thing you\u8217\'92ve kept my tongue intact because you\u8217\'92ll have to settle for -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob made to cut Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words short with his blade, but Purl leapt up and pinned Sob\u8217\'92s wrist to the wall. \u8220\'93He doesn\u8217\'92t have a Spark,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s not worth it. Save it for the Hrkans.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob grunted, sheathed his sword, then stormed out of the narrow chamber.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wake left a void of purpose in the air, and Mandrameen seized the moment by inserting himself into the conversation with all the bluster and arrogance of a churchmouse.}

Like, you people think I\u8217\'92m some kind of living curse but I\u8217\'92m not, I\u8217\'92m just a person.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl crossed her arms and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you have nothing to hide, why didn\u8217\'92t you cooperate with Moto?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because Moto is an asshole, that\u8217\'92s why.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl rolled her eyes. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s why? You serious?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He threw me into a lizard pit!\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Lock eyes with purl. Stuck in. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know, he also said you killed yourself, that\u8217\'92s why you were dead out in the Junei plain. Is that true?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t kill myself. I was stabbed in the chest by this crazy guy in Meskalim.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Salavan? The governor of Meskalim?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The same,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93He is an eccentric one. Three beans short of a full pod, he is. He was raving about some kind of prophecy involving a painter and some god I\u8217\'92d never heard of. I\u8217\'92m a painter, you know, I mostly do portraits, and, well, that doesn\u8217\'92t matter. I guess he thought I might be the one to fulfill this old prophecy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t seem to believe him. \u8220\'93This prophecy involved killing you?\u8221\'94 she asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I guess.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl paused to consider Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s story. At first, she seemed confused, like there wasn\u8217\'92t a word straight. Then Mandri saw a glint in her eye and her whole countenance shifted to }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Which god did you say it was?\u8221\'94 Purl asked.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Which god was the prophecy about?\u8221\'94}

Salavan said it was the same god as Solraheen\u8217\'92s brother, Ulhuun, but he had a different name for him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mid?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, that was it.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Look to eachother. Eyebrows raised.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You said you\u8217\'92re a painter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah. Well, I was, I\u8217\'92m not anymore though. I\u8217\'92m a farmer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before he could finish his sentence, Purl had already swiveled on one foot and rushed out of the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looks to Mazyd Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo chuckled and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That went poorly for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What did I say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I take it you haven\u8217\'92t run across many desert dwellers. Their superstitious folk. You\u8217\'92ve just spooked that girl.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Clearly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd Obo pulled himself out of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s corner and stretched himself along the floor, now that there were fewer bodies in the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can hear Purl talking with Sob right now. Want to know what they\u8217\'92re saying?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo crooked his ear towards the entrance. Mandri tried to pick Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice from out amongst the whispering echoes and the sound of pattering feet of that carried right Minting Rock\u8217\'92s many tunnelwork.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have such trouble.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Purl mentions something called the Midden Rite\u8230\'85 Has to do with Mid, and that prophecy you were talking about. They fear this Mid\u8230\'85 That\u8217\'92s putting it lightly\u8230\'85 Oooph, Sob wants to cut off your head... While Purl\u8230\'85 Purl thinks Ayram should know about you first... Sob\u8217\'92s being stubborn about it\u8230\'85 And, aha! This is great. Purl says that if you truly are some prophesied soul, then killing you won\u8217\'92t solve anything because you\u8217\'92ll just find a way to come back. Now that\u8217\'92s the kind of childlike logic you love to hear from the faithful.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s exactly what Salavan said when he killed me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you know what, here you are, alive.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe I am,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s funny, here I was thinking Mid never existed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If Solraheen exists, why wouldn\u8217\'92t his brother?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazydai have searched for evidence of Mid\u8217\'92s existence, and we haven\u8217\'92t found a shred. Solraheen is real enough, buried deep under Jeket. I should add that, even if Ulhuun, or Mid, isn\u8217\'92t real, the fear of him is. You should be careful mentioning one of those names around these Ayramun. They\u8217\'92re some secret cult of Solraheen that I\u8217\'92ve never heard of.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think it\u8217\'92s a little late for not mentioning Mid.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but you were truthful, and that counts for something with these people\u8230\'85 It\u8217\'92s got Purl convinced that you were an unwitting participant in whatever happened in Meskalim.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah, now you\u8217\'92ve convinced me too.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sighed. He peeked under the poultice on his leg and was surprised to see that the black rot was already receding. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93At least Purl seems like a normal human being.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo propped himself up on an elbow and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is a \u8216\'91normal human being\u8217\'92, Mandri? I\u8217\'92ve known enough humans to know that there\u8217\'92s no such thing as \u8216\'91normal\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I mean reasonable. She seems reasonable.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I would argue that there\u8217\'92s no such thing as a reasonable human being either.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Of course there is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There isn\u8217\'92t,\u8221\'94 said Obo, smiling as he said it.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ok, she seems kind. Ever met a kind human before?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kindness for kindness sake? No. There\u8217\'92s always some expectation of reciprocity or divine reward.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry you feel that way. There\u8217\'92s kind people out there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Like Purl?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She seems to be kind, yeah.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo propped himself up on both elbows and pulled his robe open to reveal the scar running down his sternum. He pointed at it and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Purl cut me open. Then she cut off her hand and buried it in my chest. As we speak, her fingers are gripping my heart. She means to make me her slave. Tell me, is this some foreign styling of kindness I\u8217\'92ve not yet encountered?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a hand in your chest?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not any old hand. It is Purl\u8217\'92s hand. That\u8217\'92s what a ___ does, they invest their will into your vital through the use of their dominate hand.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Never back down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, you\u8217\'92re not human. There\u8217\'92s a hierarchy to things like kindness.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah. Like, it\u8217\'92s not kind to a lizard to hunt it for food, but really, it is kind, because it\u8217\'92s more important to feed that lizard to a starving neighbor. I would say someone who does that is kind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know what, Mandri. You are right. So long as we define kindness as unselfish concern for your own kind, then yes, I have met kind human beings. In fact, just about every person I\u8217\'92ve ever met is \u8216\'91kind\u8217\'92 in that respect, they just have differing definitions as to what \u8216\'91kind\u8217\'92 of thing is worth helping. Perhaps I should look into the etymology of the word. \u8216\'91Kindness\u8217\'92 does seem to imply a discrimination according to kind. It\u8217\'92s that I was operating under the assumption that we are discussing a truer kindness, a blind altruism, in which case, I can assure you, Purl is not a kind human being.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She seems nice. Nice. Can we say that? You know, people aren\u8217\'92t all bloodthirsty, power mad, assholes pining for rape and war and destruction. You\u8217\'92ve spent too much time in the palaces of Jeket.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, consider where we are. We are literally inside of a rock, in the middle of nowhere, and yet...\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen stood up and looked through one of the small holes in the wall behind him. It was hard to see much because the rock was thick, limiting the field of view. A Hrkan column.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look, just because the Hrkan\u8217\'92s rampaging has brought them all the way out here, that doesn\u8217\'92t mean everyone else is a .\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know, earlier you were saying these Ayramun were good people, and now you\u8217\'92re trashing them?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you understood that my expectations for desert folk are so low that \u8216\'91goodness\u8217\'92 is euphemism for a baseline degree of decency.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, but, come on. I\u8217\'92ve seen a Hrkan conscript. They\u8217\'92re as skinny as me. And most of these Ayramun are killers. I bet Ayram alone could take twenty or thirty Hrks before getting knicked. And this rock is practically a castle. It\u8217\'92s got murder holes. Its got a well. Everything.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shades, like us Mazydai, are not human. They\u8217\'92re born and bred for one purpose alone: putting down a Mazyd should one ever escape the leash, and as such, they are quite powerful creatures.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, what, he\u8217\'92s got magic?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not like me, no. But to your eyes, a Shade might seem superhuman.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo looks through the hole. Perfect discipline. Mandri doubted there were enough murder holes to make this defense work. Trickle of fear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is he a swordsman?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is, and he\u8217\'92s a far stronger than any human being could hope to be. Ayram may be big, but he\u8217\'92ll got cut down to size quickly enough.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And if they get in, that Shade is going to kill you, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is his mandate.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you\u8217\'92re just going to lay there and let him do it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I am.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought we were friends, Obo. If you were a true friend, you wouldn\u8217\'92t sit idly by while I get chopped to pieces.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s an interesting thing for you to say, because I distinctly recall you claiming that true friendship has nothing to do with supplying favors.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Saving a friend\u8217\'92s life isn\u8217\'92t a favor, it\u8217\'92s what friends are for.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So we }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 are}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  friends, then?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll wash your nubs with the richest blueseed oil that I can find. I\u8217\'92ll make it myself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are only proving my point, Mandri. \u8216\'91Friendship\u8217\'92 is a coercive, transactional system that is entirely contingent on the assumption of reciprocation.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo, stop. Just stop. Help me understand why you won\u8217\'92t open your goddamn mouth, and blast sunfire into those Hrkan faces. I mean, they\u8217\'92re coming to kill you. Do you have no sense of self-preservation?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t need to understand, Mandri. We are friends. We should simply encourage each other in this time of crisis, no?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay, Obo. Okay. You\u8217\'92re right. Let\u8217\'92s encourage each other. What should I say? I love you Obo, and I can\u8217\'92t wait to get slapped in the face with a sword right next to your skewered corpse. I can\u8217\'92t wait to set foot in the come-hereafter. Now, I know you haven\u8217\'92t got a Spark, so you won\u8217\'92t be there, but that\u8217\'92s just, well, that just makes all this so much sweeter, doesn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo laughed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It really does.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, it doesn\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Suddenly, a whistle, shrill and piercing, rang out from the Hrkan column. It was not a sound that Mandri had ever heard. It was metallic, tinny and it quivered like a strandtail\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s warble. It was ten times louder than any four-fingered shepherd\u8217\'92s whistle. It was sharper than the shriek of hunting hawk. The sound cut through the rock so clearly that it\u8217\'92s source might as well have been in the room. It was a pain between Mandri\u8217\'92s ears, but it was doing something deadlier to Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was collapsed on the floor, and his eyes were rolling around in their sockets, twitching and turning like there was something inside his skull stabbing at his ocular nerve. Then the whistling jumped to a higher pitch, and Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whole body began to convulse. Mandri reached out to keep Obo\u8217\'92s head from thumping against the stone, but before he could do anything, Obo\u8217\'92s stomach wretched, his chest heaved, and a dim, blue, formless ember shot out from his mouth, leaving his body limp and lifeless. The strange light hovered just above Obo\u8217\'92s lips for the briefest spell, then the whistling shifted its register again, and the ember darted right towards Mandrameen\u8217\'92s head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri ducked out of the way, and the ember whizzed past his neck, its energy scorching his flesh as it went. It continued on to punch a hole the size of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fist into the rock behind him, and Mandri spun around just in time to watch it zip out into the sky. He lost sight of it for a moment against the deep blue, then found it again as it dove towards the Hrkan line. As it fell, the whistling fell to a drowning timbre, until, with a flash, the light and the whistling were snuffed out altogether, as if swallowed up by something amidst the Hrkan line.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ears could recover their tuning, the Hrkan horn of war sounded again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 BWWWAAAAAAAWWWWW-oooooooo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The deep bellow nearly shook Mandri out of his skin. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard the horn before in Jeketian parades meant to reinforce the power of the Hrkan lords, but this time, this time the horn was meant for him, and on that end there was a terror welling up in his gut.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Through the hole left by Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ember, Mandri could see the Hrkan column clearly. It was flattening out to a square, and as soon as that square was made solid, a command was barked, and the soldiers began their advance, bracing their white, oblong shields up against the rain of missiles that was sure to come.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Twenty paces later, the arrows flew out from Minting Rock. It felt to Mandri like the rock had come alive, like he was inside the stomach of a lumbering ridgeback lizard shooting it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s quills at an onrushing Hrkan snake, and while most of the arrows bounced harmlessly off the Hrkan hide, some snuck in between the scales, wounding the creature, marked here and there by the sudden tumbling of one of the Hrkan number and the triumphant whoops and yips of the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yet these little victories did nothing to slow the Hrkan advance. Every gap opened by the death of one soldier was closed in rhythmic time. Left, right, left, reform. Left, right, left, reform. No stumbling. No gap between the lines. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Inside of Minting Rock there was a flurry of activity. Ayramun would scuttle from room to room, trying to find a better angled hole to fire upon their target. Some who scampered by Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burial chamber were ferrying bundles of arrows from one shooting nest to another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob rushed by, then stumbled backwards, noticing the new hole in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Move out of the way!\u8221\'94 he shouted, then ran in, kicking Obo\u8217\'92s lifeless body to the side, and started firing arrows down at the marching men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A gleam in sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eye, total fixation on the task, gleam when the, }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Not being able to see what was going turned Mandri into an anxious wreck. He knew the Hrkans would be at the rock soon, but what they would do, how many the Ayramun would kill, how . Then Mandri heard a noise which}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink. TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What was that?\u8221\'94 Sob wondered aloud.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sounds like a fucking chisel,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink. TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob turned around, eyes wide in alarm. Then he shoved Mandri aside and leapt towards the tunnels. Mandri made to follow, but Sob stopped him with a shove on the shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri began to argue, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If there\u8217\'92s a way out-\u8221\'94 but Sob shouted over him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shut up and stay put!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scurried back to the hole in the wall and tried his best to make sense of the situation. All he could see was a bevy of upturned shields, in the center of each, the gold-eyed sun, the sigil of Hrk, looking up at him with dumb indifference.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 DINK-DINK-DINK}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The chiseling was getting louder, faster. Then, echoing up the tunnels behind, the first roars men possessed by the spirit of battle. Somewhere far below, in that entrance tunnel, men were about to get hacked to pieces.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then came a loud crack - the snap of sandstone snapping. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CRACKKKKkkkk-kkk-kkkkkk-k.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The whole of Minting Rock lurched. Mandri stumbled, felt the rumble of the structure beginning to collapse under his feet. The sound of crunching rock echoed round like the peal of distant thunder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then all went silent.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 No shouting. No chiseling. No noisome brawl or clashing of swords. Even the sandfleas gnawing on loose grain stopped and swirled their antennae, sensing an ominous in the air.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CHINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A long, jagged crack exploded into the floor of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burial chamber. Minting Rock lurched again, and the dust of ages shook loose from the ceiling, as if the room above had been hammered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted. \u8220\'93Obo, wake the fuck up!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With a jolt, the crack in the floor opened wider, then a thunderous boom sent it shooting across the length of the room, fracturing the chamber in two. The whole left side slid down an inch before coming to a rest on some new foundation of rubble, a, twain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri, fear pulsing in chest, yanked one of the aged corpses out its resting place and tossed it onto the ground. He then grabbed Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wrist and threw him into the now unoccupied grave. He pushed the Mazyd as far towards the back as he could, stuffing Obo\u8217\'92s tumbling arms under his body, then Mandri crawled in alongside him. The moment Mandri tucked in his legs, the ceiling started to collapse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first thing to go was the clay oil lamp. It jostled loose from its hook and smashed onto the floor, splashing licks of oil and flame about the room. Then the walls shook, and the seams in the ceiling burst, shooting a jet of smoke into the room, flooding Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grave, obscuring the air so completely that Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t see the hail of stone crashing down. What he did see, after wiping the dust from his eyes, was the awesome sight of Minting Rock split in half like a geode.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before his shock could even register, the opposite half began to fall away. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Fearful screams split the air as those Ayramun caught on the wrong side of Minting Rock grasped their impending doom. One of the Ayramun, his face sodden with dust, came leaping out of a tunnel in the opposite face. Mandri watched as he flew across the widening gap, but his flailing arms never found purchase, and the man fell screaming into the dust.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That half-shorn shell of Minting rock hit the ground and rolled away, but the structure didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t buckle under it\u8217\'92s own weight. It rolled away, then canted back, like a melon half rolling , then settled down it\u8217\'92s edge,  .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri peered down from his blessed perch at the chaos, wind tousling his hair. A good number of Hrkan troops had been crushed under the undone half of Minting Rock. No doubt some Ayramun were buried down there as well. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see clearly through the swirling smoke, but he could see a swarm of white Hrkan cloaks, and a sprinkling of black Ayramun rags. A yell rang out and these two blood rushed each other. The battle was once again joined.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looked to his left and right - there was no clear way to get down. He would have to climb. Then he thought better of it. He thought that, perhaps, it was best to be stuck up in a hole as high as he was. No matter who won, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be safe. He laid back down and tried to cut, when heard the familiar sound of the chisel chipping away at what was left of Minting Rock.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And he was thrown from his grave as easily as a .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Tumbled through, like a skipping stone, and came to stop }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s when he saw the Shade. He knew it was the Shade because it was identical to the one he\u8217\'92d seen before: average height, slim build, pale, and swaddled in white woolen robes. It had metal charms and dangling from its belt and, and in its hand was a curved sword gleaming in the light of the sun. It was sniffing the air, sniffing right around the area where Mandri\u8217\'92s.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto is just there, sword drawn.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto kicks sand. Sprays up high. Blnds. Ducks, twirls swipes.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Shade reluctantly impressed.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Shade laughed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Self-taught? You mean to say that you\u8217\'92ve.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll teach you something, if you\u8217\'92re willing.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto, calmly grasps his scabbard. Adopts a different stance. Mandri there was a fight within the fight that his untrained eyes could not see. The Shade seemed quite amused with it all. Whatever Moto was doing amused him, and out of habit the Shade tried to find a sympathetic eye to share in the absurdity, but all there was was Mandri, so the Shade. Then he walked towards Moto, the most casual stroll, like he was out to buy some lunch.}
