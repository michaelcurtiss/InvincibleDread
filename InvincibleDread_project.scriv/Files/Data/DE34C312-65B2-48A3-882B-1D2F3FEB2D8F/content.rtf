He was buried under the earth. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d walked the world for one million years, protected it from harm, but entombed he could do nothing as the Sandrijin\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Great Drought\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 ravaged the world above. The Sandrijin lasted one hundred years. It killed thousands. It transformed the Sand into what it is. Yet among all it\u8217\'92s ravages, the one which effectively destroyed the Old Jandri world was the drying up of the Ukut river. With the river gone, the tribe called the Gairo could no longer sustain themselves on the Ukut plateau, and so they swept down into the Sand\u8217\'92s Middle Portion. But it was not the Gairo who mattered, it was the people whom they butchered and displaced\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Hrks. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Hrks wandered the Sand for one thousand years until, at last, Arnaggu led his people out of their suffering and into the Fertile Portion. Little in the way of art or architecture survived their barbarian charm. Every shrine and temple had their arches broken and their eternal flames snuffed out. It is said that the only thing that truly survived in tact was belief in Solraheen, for the Hrks could not deny what they could see with their own eyes, buried there under the crater at the mouth of the river Jek. The Hrks claimed that holy crater as theirs, built their city, Jeket, inside of it, and from there, they conquered the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They were not the first to conquer the world. It had been done at least once before, back when Solraheen walked the earth. An Old Jandri king named Dror held dominion over all of Jandri. To prove it, he placed interlocking blocks of granite two-by-two-by-ten at every bend of every river. Out of these grey columns he carved his long-bearded, tall-robed image, and though some them survived the Hrks, none of survived unscathed. The statue in the best condition was first one to be built, built at the Jek\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s source overlooking the Shoglok falls. It stands there above the crashing water and rising mist looking like a wraith, for it is sanded so smooth by erosion that no discernible feature of Dror remains. He is little more than a grey wither in the general shape of a man, doing nothing but watching the sun rise and fall.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The river descends down into the foothills where it is guarded by a spate of Drors that have been sanded into smooth, pointed pillars, more like cattle scratch posts than a filigreed statue of a king, their heads reduced to conical nubs, their swords worn down to the hilt. The river then pours out of the foothills and down into the brink of Hrkan civilization, where the Drors are somewhat shielded from the wind but were not able to hide from the chisels of recriminate outland men. Further down the river and into on the long and winding plain, Dror\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s component parts begin to disappear altogether, for the stones are handy materials in the building of pastoral walls. By the time one reaches the most distant city-spawn of Jeket, all that is left of Dror\u8217\'92s monuments are the enormous plinths upon which they once stood. These foundation stones were too large to handle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Old Jandri statues are disintegrating the nearer they come to Jeket\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there is imagery here, and it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s unsubtle and pointed, and so of course people disagree about what it means. A Hrkan Lord would say that it is a sign of Hrk\u8217\'92s cleansing influence on the old world, while an outlander thinks its a sign of Hrk\u8217\'92s corrupting influence. They long for that earlier age when people were rootless, when herds of oxen were free to be chased across the continent, when women wove blankets so long they could be wrapped around a village, and when men were honest and would cut off their own fingers just to prove that they were sorry. But all of that is gone. Solraheen walked the earth for one million years and yet nothing made in that age truly remains.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Somehow, this wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even close to being the stupidest argument that Mandri had ever heard regarding art interpretation. The worst was the argument surrounding the Stria which hangs in the entrance hall of the Temple Krait. This painting is large, two men tall and one wide, and in a technical sense the painting is a masterwork. The scene overflows with silk-satin of every color, and silk-satin is a challenging material to paint because it inevitably moves, the reflections change, and so most painters make use of mannequins and glue to keep the folds still, but Stria, inspired by Solraheen, could capture its likeness without reference. The actual subject is a white-robed man and a red-robed woman standing in a window-lit room. Their postures seem confused, their backs are turned to each-other, and both look over the shoulder at the other. Some say it depicts a man preserving his honor by refusing the temptations of the young beauty, while others say it is the woman who preserves her virtue by shunning the advances of a besotted man. This argument can stir up literal firestorms, yet the Temple Krait accommodates either interpretation, for the temple praises chastity above all other virtues, and surely that is the message, for the temple\u8217\'92s dome can be seen through the window.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a unsubtle signal taking place between the two subjects. She\u8217\'92s thrusting her thumb between two of her fingers, and he accepts by making a circle with this thumb and middle finger. It would seem, then, that the temple\u8217\'92s dome is no chastely crown, it is the watchful eye under which two lovers plan a tryst.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That no one seemed to read it that way made Mandrameen insane. He once pointed the suggestive hands out to a mendicant, and he was told, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Young man, your mind is overwhelmed with lust.\u8221\'94 While that might have been true it didn\u8217\'92t matter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Stria was clearly intending to make a mockery of all these prudes. And it was much the same with those crumbling statues of Dror\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the pivotal detail that no one seemed to notice was that half of those statues were sitting alone out in an empty desert because over the centuries, the river Jek has changed it\u8217\'92s course too many times to count. The lesson here is not that Old Jandri was better, or that Hrk should last forever, its that neither matters at all\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 creation\u8217\'92s only constant is that changes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If Mandri was sure of anything, he was sure of that. Nothing stays the same for long, and everything he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ever seen reinforced that presumption.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Mandri stepped down into the tunnel that led under Minting Rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly, he bore no suspicions of the rock\u8217\'92s age. He supposed he was walking into an outland hovel like any other, and that the rock itself was only a surface marker. He ventured into that sunlit central well, he looked up to see a canted column of light shining down into Minting Rock\u8217\'92s interior and suddenly the pain in his demon-bitten leg was less severe. Strange how the sensation of awe can do that. With this shaft drilled right through it, it seemed as if Minting Rock were a cast-off bead from the necklace of some forgotten mountain god.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He grabbed the rope which hung down into the dark, and an out of sight an Ayramun began to pull him up. His feet left the floor, bounced off the stone wall, and soon after they kicked out into a void. Then someone lit a torch and space around him lit up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This first floor of Minting Rock was a shallow, bowl shaped room with Mandri hanging out in the middle of it like a uvula. The curved floor was carved to look like a liquid surface, with concentric rings of ripples and cresting waves in miniature, all of it polished to a sheen as smooth as a Hrkan Lord\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s table. Amidst this stone sea were four pillars holding up a perfectly level ceiling. These pillars were no ordinary pillars, not rectangular or columnar, they were stone demons, full and dynamic figures half bent against the low ceiling, each one scaled and snarling. Mandri might have thought them real if it weren\u8217\'92t for the Ayramun\u8217\'92s packs scattered about between them, with Hill, torch in hand, rummaging about for something just out of sight. The, and the Ayramun were treating as a storage space. Hill paid Mandri no mind as the hands above continued to pull Mandri upwards.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The second floor was a bulbous cylinder, and every inch of its surface was carved into criss-crossed overlapping weave. The topmost layer was reminiscent of a chain, the ceiling of this room was splattered with symbols reminiscent of the heavens\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 in the center, surrounding the hole of the shaft which led ever upwards, was a primitive sun-rose compass. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Minting Rock was unbroken piece of Old Jandri craftsmanship. So far as the dim lantern light could tell, it was wholly unspoiled. Unspoiled, save for the presence of Seb. Seb smelled. Unwashed and foul, the smell one imagines when hearing stories about sign of demonic possession. Seb smelled the worst of them all.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Dumped on the floor.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 An unseen hand grabbed a fistful of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robe in between his shoulder blades, and pulled him fully clear of the well-hole. He was then dropped on to the hard stone floor and the pain in his thigh reasserted itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d pulled him out was Seb. The stark contrast between Seb\u8217\'92s brown, rugged, tufty self and the polished interior was startling. Not too than a rat in a gilded temple.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this place?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This be Minting Rock,\u8221\'94 Seb said as his teeth squelched a borcandi spine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t care about the name,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93What }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  this place? What is it for? Who made it?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb nudged Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hip with the toe of his boot. Then he shooed Mandri up against the wall with flapping fingers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep out of the way,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scuttled backwards, then shoved his injured leg flush against the embroidered wall so that it didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t stick out into the middle of the floor. It was then that he noticed that Obo was in the room with them. The Mazyd lay on the opposite side in a black heap, still playing dead. Amusingly, Obo had one eye open, squinting out at the world, and when Mandri noticed, Obo winked. \line \tab Mandri shook his head and chuckled to himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Something funny?\u8221\'94, Seb asked. Judging by the dark look in his eyes, the man clearly thought that Mandri was laughing at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93Just, you know, can\u8217\'92t believe this is all happening to me. It\u8217\'92s all a bit ridiculous.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It ain\u8217\'92t ridiculous at all,\u8221\'94 said Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nasty bite,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Bet it hurts. What did it look like? The demon.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Actually, It looked a bit like those statues down below.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did it!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is that surprising?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I been out here thirty somethin\u8217\'92 years, an I never seen no demon like that. Nothin\u8217\'92 nearly like a man.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I\u8217\'92ve seen two.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb raised a skeptical eye. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Two? When was the other?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93About the day before I died. There was this\u8230\'85woman. An old woman.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An ole woman?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She was a normal old woman until she\u8230\'85it\u8217\'92s like she sprouted fangs and she\u8230\'85I saw her eat an ox\u8217\'92s Spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was standing like a loon. The story sounded ridiculous coming, and he remembered how hopped upon burgeon beer he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been at the time, and started to wonder if he\u8217\'92d hallucinated it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You lie,\u8221\'94 Seb spat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, I swear it. She even said her name. Pell.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s  Stop jaw chewing on his spine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What? I swear its true.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You better not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Squats down. Close to a whisper.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seein\u8217\'92 one demon is seein\u8217\'92 one demon\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s fine. Seein\u8217\'92 two is seein\u8217\'92 too many. Starts to look like it means somethin\u8217\'92. Know what I mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You ain\u8217\'92t gotta convince me you\u8217\'92re harmless\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 I can see it easy. But if you want to convince everyone else, don\u8217\'92t tell no one you saw some ole bitch demon named Pell. If anyone asks, the demon that bit you is the only demon you ever seen.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Cause we kill demons. We kill people that demons \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 High above, a silhouette in the central well, on the roof of the rock. A shrill whistle. Hustle and bustle. Shouting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s going on?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep out of the way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Roaring. A lizard. Clanking sound. When Ayram burst into the central room.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram first black iron spud bar like a staff. then Moto, and finally the old witch Elrahet. They gathered around Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How did you do it!\u8221\'94 Ayram shouted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto took a step forward and delivered a hard kick to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s body. He steadied himself against the wall and was about to deliver another when Elrahet told him to stop.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s already awake,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Indeed, Obo was stirring. He struggled to upright itself.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo coughed a out, as if his rib were digging into his lung, then said through labored breath,  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I assume you\u8217\'92re referring to the column of Hrkan skelsi marching this way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How did you do it.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb squatted down, grabbed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s right wrist and and pulled Mandri\u8217\'92s arm over his shoulder, then helped him stand up. The two walked like this until they were lost in the darkness of the hall and Seb dropped Mandri\u8217\'92s arm along with any pretense of caring about Mandri\u8217\'92s wellbeing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hurry up,\u8221\'94 he said as he pushed Mandri up a chubby set of curling stairs.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It quickly became difficult for Mandri to maintain a sense of where he was within the rock. He was shoved through so many dark and twisting passages that all he knew for sure was that he was moving away from the center. It wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t any instinct for dead reckoning that told him this, it was because each passage and threshold became more cluttered and cramped, and the stonework less polished an more rough as the recent additions.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri got to thinking, after bumping his head on an absurdly low-ceiling, that whoever had carved out this rock had carved out too much of it. From the outside, Minting Rock already looked unstable, like a liggu nut standing tip-toe on it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stubby stem. From the inside, that feeling of being precariously balanced was magnified, and unless the Old Jandri world as sensitive to the straining forces of tension and compression as Hrkan engineer, the whole thing was bound to fall apart. The further out Mandri went, the more slapdash the passages and rooms became. This was more in line with what he was expecting from Old Jandri hands\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 like snot-nosed moles they carved out holes and rooms according to whim. By the time they reached the outer section of Minting rock, Mandri\u8217\'92s toes and fingers would stumble upon stress cracks in the floors and walls. Once, in this dusty dark, he bumped shoulders with an unworked wooden beam that arched up and over his head to keep the floor above from caving in. The fact that it was all still standing seemed a miracle. The higher up he went and narrower the walls became. The ceilings were not just low but uneven. Eventually, he was pushed into a long and narrow room that was almost exactly as tall and as wide as he was.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This room abutted the outer shell of Minting rock, and as such it had access to natural light through a stippled pattern of finger-sized holes bored into the far wall. The sun didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t shine directly through them, so these pinpricks of day sat on the wall illuminating nothing, like a constellation of stars. Mandri recognized the pattern they made immediately, as when the dots were connected they formed an ancient stitch that defined the Old Jandri aesthetic: a circle of diamonds radiating out from a central sun rose. It was the traditional symbol of Solraheen, before the Hrkans got control of Him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was not an empty room. Alabastron incense bottles sat on the floor near the entrance, and thin tendrils of smoke swirled up out of them. The smell of this smoke was horrible. Mandri felt like he was wading through the stench of a mound of peaches that had been left to putrefy in a muggy spring sun. It was a stench so sickly sweet that, as he was pushed further into the room by Sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s elbow, he had to breathe through his mouth to keep from gagging.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He thought, at first, that the smell was intended to trigger in him a spiritual impulse. He thought that this was some kind of prayer room and he knew that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what prayer room incense was supposed to do. He didn\u8217\'92t entertain the thought that this cloying scent was meant to mask a more rancid smell until he reached out to steady himself against the wall, and instead of slapping against rock, his fingers rubbed up against something that felt curiously like skin. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A shock of fright shot through his arm, and he recoiled his hand as quick as lightning. His eyes darted to the wall where his hand had been, but his vision hadn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t yet adjusted to the dimness. The only thing he could see for certain was a dark recess cut into the rock. He reached out again, but Sob slapped his hand away.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep your hands to yourself,\u8221\'94 Sob commanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s in there?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t answer. He was busy dragging Mazyd Obo into the room by the wrists. Mazyd Obo, however, had resigned himself to his , and so was free to answer Mandri\u8217\'92s question. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a dead body.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sniffed the air again, and now that his nose knew what to look for, it ferreted out the tang of rotting flesh being smothered by all that incense smoke. This wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t a prayer room, it was a burial chamber.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri turned to protest his new accommodation, but before he could get out a word, Sob shoved him towards the far wall.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sit down and be quiet,\u8221\'94 Sob said. His stern tone cowed Mandri into compliance. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sat down, set his back against the cold rock wall, and was about to settle in for another boring spell of captivity, when all of a sudden, Sob tossed the legless Mazyd through the dark like the once great statesman was heap of dirty laundry. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo crashed into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest, and the two fumbled around in the dark, trying to set themselves straight within the cramped confines of the sepulcher.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob tried to temper the commotion with a furious whisper. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is a sacred place,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Quit your rumbling. Don\u8217\'92t touch anything. In fact, don\u8217\'92t move at all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice came from the tunnel behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I need a light.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri heard the click of an iron striker against flint, and a moment later, a flame sputtered to life above his head. Suspended from the ceiling was a clay oil lamp, and as Sob moved away, its light splayed out on the room\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s interior, bringing the haunting sepulcher to life.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Cut into the rock walls were coffin-sized slits, three on either side, stacked one above the other. Inside each of these, resting in a peaceful repose, was a corpse. Each was in a different stage of decomposition, and each was as naked as come from the womb, and all of them, as far as Mandri could tell, were women.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The corpse he could see clearest was as dry and shriveled as a grape fallen from the vine. It was impossible to say for certain how long that body had been laying there, for an unbothered corpse in the Sand can last for an age. Cloistered away in Minting Rock, sheltered from the wind, Mandri figured that a corpse could last for as long as Solraheen willed it. These women could be as ancient as language.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But ancient corpses don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t smell, at least Mandrameen didn\u8217\'92t think they did, so he thought that one of those graves had to be recently inhumed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He eyed each grave to try and find out which one it was. None of what he could see seemed particularly fresh; a dessicated hand with purple fingers, a plaited braid of cloud-white hair, mostly he saw dry, skin-wrapped bones. No hint of bloat. No trace of the tar-like iridescence of fresh rot.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri began to wonder if there really was a smell at all, and that perhaps he was just imagining it. Then he thought that perhaps ancient corpses did indeed have a smell. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d never actually seen one up close like this. He\u8217\'92d always assumed that the white-robed corpses of saints suspended from the ceilings of Solitant temples didn\u8217\'92t stink. Of course, those temples burn incense at all hours, so that whole spiel he\u8217\'92d heard about the smell triggering the source of all wonder could have just been a ruse to distract from the fact that the houses of Solraheen literally had rot and decay nailed to the rafters.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Mandri looked down and saw the spreading rot in his leg and he laughed, realizing that the smell was probably coming from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sob, move out of the way,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob grunted, then backed out of the room, and in scampered Purl. She was hunched over, clutching a bundle of goods close to her chest with her good left arm. When she got to Mandri, she knelt, then she pawed some her things onto the floor with the wristless stump of her right arm. First to drop was a clean strip of wool folded tight, then a bundle of damp leaves knotted at the stems, and finally a stone mortar hit the floor with a crack. The only things left nestled in her arm were three spool-shaped bowls that were packed to the brim with waxy substances, one yellow, one red, and one white. Purl hesitated with these, clearly not used to having only one hand, so Mandri reached out to help. He grabbed the bowls one by one, and set them down between them. Then Purl had him stretch out his leg and she rolled his wound into the light. She eyed the festering flesh with keen interest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Would ya look at that,\u8221\'94 she muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob had been standing behind her, and he hovered over her shoulder to get a look in himself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re blocking the light,\u8221\'94 Purl snipped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob moved back, then cleared his grizzled throat and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t do anything yet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not?\u8221\'94 Purl asked. \u8220\'93This wound needs curing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want to question him first.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You two can talk while I\u8217\'92m working.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl pulled a thumb-sized pestle from her ragged robes, then she dolloped a two-finger-dip of each of the three waxes into her mortar.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said stop,\u8221\'94 Sob pecked. \u8220\'93Only treat him if he talks, and that\u8217\'92s provided he is convincing with the truth.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brow knit tight in dismay. She looked up at Sob as if to grasp the truth in his face, and asked \u8220\'93You want to torture him for information?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is not torture,\u8221\'94 Sob said defensively.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Look at his leg! He\u8217\'92s marked for death, and you want to withhold treatment?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is not torture.\u8221\'94 Sob repeated.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It might not be torture,\u8221\'94 Purl said, \u8220\'93but it\u8217\'92s something like it. It\u8217\'92s extortion, or, I don\u8217\'92t know, it\u8217\'92s not right, that\u8217\'92s what it is.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not torture or extortion, Purl, it\u8217\'92s encouragement.\u8221\'94 Sob then looked to Mandri to make sure that Mandri was getting the measure of his words. \u8220\'93Tell me what you were doing in the Junei hills, and Purl will heal your wound.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl clicked her teeth and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You sound like this sparkless Mazyd. I, for one, don\u8217\'92t need anyone to tell me anything to do something decent.\u8221\'94 And with that, Purl plucked some of the leaves into the mortar, spit into it, then got to smashing that waxy substance into a paste.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t bring me into this,\u8221\'94 Mazyd Obo said.\line \tab Purl stopped her grinding. Sob raised his brow in surprise. Mandri turned to look at his wretch of a friend, who was smushed up in between his shoulder and the wall, looking upset. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no need to insult me,\u8221\'94 Obo said to Purl. \u8220\'93This man\u8217\'92s cruelty is his own, I have nothing to do with it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have everything to do with it,\u8221\'94 Purl said flatly. She then continued on to smash the the leaves down into the wax, the rhythmic knead of her pestle pulping the mixture into a syrupy goo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m quite certain the only thing I\u8217\'92ve done to you Ayramun is fight in self defense. You can hardly blame me for killing your ilk when they were lobbing arrows at my throat. What would you do if some idiot is willing to blow himself up at your horses\u8217\'92 feet?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob unsheathed a sword which was hidden underneath his robe. The sudden appearance of long, curved blade startled Mandri, but Obo was unconcerned, even though the blade\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s edge threatened to split his skull in two.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That \u8216\'91idiot\u8217\'92 was my brother,\u8221\'94 Sob said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo smiled and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought he might be. He looked like a pack lizard, and here you are\u8230\'85 the resemblance is uncanny.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes lit aflame and he squeezed his sword\u8217\'92s hilt tight. \u8220\'93I wonder,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93if I cut off your tongue, would the shit still come spewing out?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, let him talk,\u8221\'94 Purl said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s good that he\u8217\'92s getting our blood up for what\u8217\'92s coming.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s coming is your deaths,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93In fact, the only way anyone in this accursed rock survives is if you treat with me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl scraped the goo out from her mortar with her fingers, and then plopped it onto the clean strip of wool. She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only way we\u8217\'92d ever treat with you, Mazyd, is if you showed the slightest scrap of humanity now and then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You want to me to slaughter seventy men, just to save your skin. Is that the \u8216\'91humanity\u8217\'92 you\u8217\'92re referring to? And oh, I might add, you people have disfigured me beyond recognition and you, Purl, mean to rob me of my will. Is that \u8216\'91humanity\u8217\'92? Am I the emblem of cruelty?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Without missing a beat, and with all the certainty of a child praying to Sol, Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, you are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo laughed, but Purl brushed away his disbelief with a snort, then said \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t pretend like those soldiers marching this way aren\u8217\'92t bloodthirsty, raping, brutes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93From where I sit, you Ayramun are much the same.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re nothing like them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah, forgive me, then. You are kind, caring folk who didn\u8217\'92t just chop off my legs. It must be that I have misplaced them. Sob, if you could go and take a look outside, they should be laying around somewhere out there.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob lowered the tip of his sword towards Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cheek and said, \u8220\'93What Ayram did to you is a mere scratch compared to what you deserve.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl nodded in agreement. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You Mazydai have killed more innocents than drought and disease.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have we? Tell me, how many lives do you think we Mazydai have saved from drought and disease?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl shook her head as she slapped the gooey poultice onto Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wound. \u8220\'93You won\u8217\'92t pull me into the mud,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93I know what you are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No you don\u8217\'92t. Outside of trying to bend me to your will, you\u8217\'92ve never once spoken to me, not until now. In fact, not a single one of you Ayramun had ever spoken to a Mazyd before last week. The truth is that I have more virtues than you can even count. Certainly more than Sob can count. Can you count, Sob? Count to ten for me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rage was close to boiling over. \u8220\'93Where I\u8217\'92m from you\u8217\'92d be killed twice over already.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where I come from, someone who employs violence to deal with uncomfortable truths is called a brute.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shut up,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you, my dear, are a brute as well. A fine figured brute, but a brute nonetheless.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob flicked his wrist and sliced Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cheek. It was surface wound, but it was enough to send a trickle of blood streaming down Obo\u8217\'92s jaw.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bloodthirsty brutes,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93And what was that last indictment of yours, Purl? Raping? You could rape me, Sob, but I don\u8217\'92t think you\u8217\'92ll find my lower half in any condition to ravage. It\u8217\'92s a good thing you\u8217\'92ve kept my tongue intact because you\u8217\'92ll have to settle for -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob made to cut Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words short with his blade, but Purl leapt up and pinned Sob\u8217\'92s wrist to the wall. \u8220\'93He doesn\u8217\'92t have a Spark,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s not worth it. Save it for the Hrkans.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wake left a void of purpose in the air, and Mandrameen seized the moment by inserting himself into the conversation with all the bluster and arrogance of a churchmouse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I could get in a word on my own behalf,\u8221\'94 he squeaked.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Because Moto is an asshole, that\u8217\'92s why.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t kill myself. I was stabbed in the chest by this crazy guy in Meskalim.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Salavan? The governor of Meskalim?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The same,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93He is an eccentric one. Three beans short of a full pod, he is. He was raving about some kind of prophecy involving a painter and some god I\u8217\'92d never heard of. I\u8217\'92m a painter, you know, I mostly do portraits, and, well, that doesn\u8217\'92t matter. I guess he thought I might be the one to fulfill this old prophecy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t seem to believe him. \u8220\'93This prophecy involved killing you?\u8221\'94 she asked.}

Salavan said it was the same god as Solraheen\u8217\'92s brother, Ulhuun, but he had a different name for him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mid?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Look to eachother. Eyebrows raised.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah. Well, I was, I\u8217\'92m not anymore though. I\u8217\'92m a farmer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before he could finish his sentence, Purl had already swiveled on one foot and rushed out of the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looks to Mazyd Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo chuckled and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That went poorly for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What did I say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I take it you haven\u8217\'92t run across many desert dwellers. Their superstitious folk. You\u8217\'92ve just spooked that girl.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Clearly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd Obo pulled himself out of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s corner and stretched himself along the floor, now that there were fewer bodies in the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can hear Purl talking with Sob right now. Want to know what they\u8217\'92re saying?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo crooked his ear towards the entrance. Mandri tried to pick Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice from out amongst the whispering echoes and the sound of pattering feet of that carried right Minting Rock\u8217\'92s many tunnelwork.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have such trouble.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Purl mentions something called the Midden Rite\u8230\'85 Has to do with Mid, and that prophecy you were talking about. They fear this Mid\u8230\'85 That\u8217\'92s putting it lightly\u8230\'85 Oooph, Sob wants to cut off your head... While Purl\u8230\'85 Purl thinks Ayram should know about you first... Sob\u8217\'92s being stubborn about it\u8230\'85 And, aha! This is great. Purl says that if you truly are some prophesied soul, then killing you won\u8217\'92t solve anything because you\u8217\'92ll just find a way to come back. Now that\u8217\'92s the kind of childlike logic you love to hear from the faithful.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s exactly what Salavan said when he killed me.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe I am,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s funny, here I was thinking Mid never existed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If Solraheen exists, why wouldn\u8217\'92t his brother?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazydai have searched for evidence of Mid\u8217\'92s existence, and we haven\u8217\'92t found a shred. Solraheen is real enough, buried deep under Jeket. I should add that, even if Ulhuun, or Mid, isn\u8217\'92t real, the fear of him is. You should be careful mentioning one of those names around these Ayramun. They\u8217\'92re some secret cult of Solraheen that I\u8217\'92ve never heard of.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think it\u8217\'92s a little late for not mentioning Mid.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but you were truthful, and that counts for something with these people\u8230\'85 It\u8217\'92s got Purl convinced that you were an unwitting participant in whatever happened in Meskalim.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sighed. He peeked under the poultice on his leg and was surprised to see that the black rot was already receding. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93At least Purl seems like a normal human being.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I mean reasonable. She seems reasonable.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ok, she seems kind. Ever met a kind human before?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Kindness for kindness sake? No. There\u8217\'92s always some expectation of reciprocity or divine reward.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry you feel that way. There\u8217\'92s kind people out there.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She seems to be kind, yeah.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo propped himself up on both elbows and pulled his robe open to reveal the scar running down his sternum. He pointed at it and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Purl cut me open. Then she cut off her hand and buried it in my chest. As we speak, her fingers are gripping my heart. She means to make me her slave. Tell me, is this some foreign styling of kindness I\u8217\'92ve not yet encountered?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a hand in your chest?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Never back down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, you\u8217\'92re not human. There\u8217\'92s a hierarchy to things like kindness.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah. Like, it\u8217\'92s not kind to a lizard to hunt it for food, but really, it is kind, because it\u8217\'92s more important to feed that lizard to a starving neighbor. I would say someone who does that is kind.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know what, Mandri. You are right. So long as we define kindness as unselfish concern for your own kind, then yes, I have met kind human beings. In fact, just about every person I\u8217\'92ve ever met is \u8216\'91kind\u8217\'92 in that respect, they just have differing definitions as to what \u8216\'91kind\u8217\'92 of thing is worth helping. Perhaps I should look into the etymology of the word. \u8216\'91Kindness\u8217\'92 does seem to imply a discrimination according to kind. It\u8217\'92s that I was operating under the assumption that we are discussing a truer kindness, a blind altruism, in which case, I can assure you, Purl is not a kind human being.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She seems nice. Nice. Can we say that? You know, people aren\u8217\'92t all bloodthirsty, power mad, assholes pining for rape and war and destruction. You\u8217\'92ve spent too much time in the palaces of Jeket.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, consider where we are. We are literally inside of a rock, in the middle of nowhere, and yet...\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you understood that my expectations for desert folk are so low that \u8216\'91goodness\u8217\'92 is euphemism for a baseline degree of decency.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, but, come on. I\u8217\'92ve seen a Hrkan conscript. They\u8217\'92re as skinny as me. And most of these Ayramun are killers. I bet Ayram alone could take twenty or thirty Hrks before getting knicked. And this rock is practically a castle. It\u8217\'92s got murder holes. Its got a well. Everything.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I caught him by surprise.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He didn\u8217\'92t look tough.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shades, like us Mazydai, are not human. They\u8217\'92re born and bred for one purpose alone: putting down a Mazyd should one ever escape the leash, and as such, they are quite powerful creatures.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, what, he\u8217\'92s got magic?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not like me, no. But to your eyes, a Shade might seem superhuman.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo looks through the hole. Perfect discipline. Mandri doubted there were enough murder holes to make this defense work. Trickle of fear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is he a swordsman?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is, and he\u8217\'92s a far stronger than any human being could hope to be. Ayram may be big, but he\u8217\'92ll got cut down to size quickly enough.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And if they get in, that Shade is going to kill you, right?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That is his mandate.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought we were friends, Obo. If you were a true friend, you wouldn\u8217\'92t sit idly by while I get chopped to pieces.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s an interesting thing for you to say, because I distinctly recall you claiming that true friendship has nothing to do with supplying favors.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So we are friends, then?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You are only proving my point, Mandri. \u8216\'91Friendship\u8217\'92 is a coercive, transactional system that is entirely contingent on the assumption of reciprocation. As soon as there is the slightest hint of an unpaid debt, then-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo, stop. Just stop. Help me understand why you won\u8217\'92t open your goddamn mouth, and blast sunfire into those Hrkan faces. I mean, they\u8217\'92re coming to kill you. Do you have no sense of self-preservation?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t need to understand, Mandri. We are friends. We should simply encourage each other in this time of crisis, no?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay, Obo. Okay. You\u8217\'92re right. Let\u8217\'92s encourage each other. What should I say? I love you Obo, and I can\u8217\'92t wait to get slapped in the face with a sword right next to your skewered corpse. I can\u8217\'92t wait to set foot in the come-hereafter. Now, I know you haven\u8217\'92t got a Spark, so you won\u8217\'92t be there, but that\u8217\'92s just, well, that just makes all this so much sweeter, doesn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo laughed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It really does.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, it doesn\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Suddenly, a whistle, shrill and piercing, rang out from the Hrkan column. It was not a sound that Mandri had ever heard. It was metallic, tinny and it quivered like a strandtail\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s warble. It was ten times louder than any four-fingered shepherd\u8217\'92s whistle. It was sharper than the shriek of hunting hawk. The sound cut through the rock so clearly that it\u8217\'92s source might as well have been in the room. It was a pain between Mandri\u8217\'92s ears, but it was doing something deadlier to Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was collapsed on the floor, and his eyes were rolling around in their sockets, twitching and turning like there was something inside his skull stabbing at his ocular nerve. Then the whistling jumped to a higher pitch, and Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whole body began to convulse. Mandri reached out to keep Obo\u8217\'92s head from thumping against the stone, but before he could do anything, Obo\u8217\'92s stomach wretched, his chest heaved, and a dim, blue, formless ember shot out from his mouth, leaving his body limp and lifeless. The strange light hovered just above Obo\u8217\'92s lips for the briefest spell, then the whistling shifted its register again, and the ember darted right towards Mandrameen\u8217\'92s head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri ducked out of the way, and the ember whizzed past his neck, its energy scorching his flesh as it went. It continued on to punch a hole the size of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fist into the rock behind him, and Mandri spun around just in time to watch it zip out into the sky. He lost sight of it for a moment against the deep blue, then found it again as it dove towards the Hrkan line. As it fell, the whistling fell to a drowning timbre, until, with a flash, the light and the whistling were snuffed out altogether, as if swallowed up by something amidst the Hrkan line.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ears could recover their tuning, the Hrkan horn of war sounded again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 BWWWAAAAAAAWWWWW-oooooooo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The deep bellow nearly shook Mandri out of his skin. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard the horn before in Jeketian parades meant to reinforce the power of the Hrkan lords, but this time, this time the horn was meant for him, and on that end there was a terror welling up in his gut.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Through the hole left by Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ember, Mandri could see the Hrkan column clearly. It was flattening out to a square, and as soon as that square was made solid, a command was barked, and the soldiers began their advance, bracing their white, oblong shields up against the rain of missiles that was sure to come.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Twenty paces later, the arrows flew out from Minting Rock. It felt to Mandri like the rock had come alive, like he was inside the stomach of a lumbering ridgeback lizard shooting it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s quills at an onrushing Hrkan snake, and while most of the arrows bounced harmlessly off the Hrkan hide, some snuck in between the scales, wounding the creature, marked here and there by the sudden tumbling of one of the Hrkan number and the triumphant whoops and yips of the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Yet these little victories did nothing to slow the Hrkan advance. Every gap opened by the death of one soldier was closed in rhythmic time. Left, right, left, reform. Left, right, left, reform. No stumbling. No gap between the lines. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Inside of Minting Rock there was a flurry of activity. Ayramun would scuttle from room to room, trying to find a better angled hole to fire upon their target. Some who scampered by Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burial chamber were ferrying bundles of arrows from one shooting nest to another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob rushed by, then stumbled backwards, noticing the new hole in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Move out of the way!\u8221\'94 he shouted, then ran in, kicking Obo\u8217\'92s lifeless body to the side, and started firing arrows down at the marching men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A gleam in sob\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eye, total fixation on the task, gleam when the, }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Not being able to see what was going turned Mandri into an anxious wreck. He knew the Hrkans would be at the rock soon, but what they would do, how many the Ayramun would kill, how . Then Mandri heard a noise which}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink. TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What was that?\u8221\'94 Sob wondered aloud.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sounds like a fucking chisel,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink. TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sob turned around, eyes wide in alarm. Then he shoved Mandri aside and leapt towards the tunnels. Mandri made to follow, but Sob stopped him with a shove on the shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri began to argue, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If there\u8217\'92s a way out-\u8221\'94 but Sob shouted over him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shut up and stay put!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scurried back to the hole in the wall and tried his best to make sense of the situation. All he could see was a bevy of upturned shields, in the center of each, the gold-eyed sun, the sigil of Hrk, looking up at him with dumb indifference.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 DINK-DINK-DINK}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The chiseling was getting louder, faster. Then, echoing up the tunnels behind, the first roars men possessed by the spirit of battle. Somewhere far below, in that entrance tunnel, men were about to get hacked to pieces.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then came a loud crack - the snap of sandstone snapping. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CRACKKKKkkkk-kkk-kkkkkk-k.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The whole of Minting Rock lurched. Mandri stumbled, felt the rumble of the structure beginning to collapse under his feet. The sound of crunching rock echoed round like the peal of distant thunder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then all went silent.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 No shouting. No chiseling. No noisome brawl or clashing of swords. Even the sandfleas gnawing on loose grain stopped and swirled their antennae, sensing an ominous in the air.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CHINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A long, jagged crack exploded into the floor of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burial chamber. Minting Rock lurched again, and the dust of ages shook loose from the ceiling, as if the room above had been hammered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted. \u8220\'93Obo, wake the fuck up!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With a jolt, the crack in the floor opened wider, then a thunderous boom sent it shooting across the length of the room, fracturing the chamber in two. The whole left side slid down an inch before coming to a rest on some new foundation of rubble, a, twain.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri, fear pulsing in chest, yanked one of the aged corpses out its resting place and tossed it onto the ground. He then grabbed Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wrist and threw him into the now unoccupied grave. He pushed the Mazyd as far towards the back as he could, stuffing Obo\u8217\'92s tumbling arms under his body, then Mandri crawled in alongside him. The moment Mandri tucked in his legs, the ceiling started to collapse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first thing to go was the clay oil lamp. It jostled loose from its hook and smashed onto the floor, splashing licks of oil and flame about the room. Then the walls shook, and the seams in the ceiling burst, shooting a jet of smoke into the room, flooding Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grave, obscuring the air so completely that Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t see the hail of stone crashing down. What he did see, after wiping the dust from his eyes, was the awesome sight of Minting Rock split in half like a geode.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before his shock could even register, the opposite half began to fall away. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Haunting screams split the air as those Ayramun stuck on the wrong side of Minting Rock grasped their impending doom. Almost directly across from where Mandri stood, a ragged, fear-stricken man straddled the half-shorn wall of what once was a tunnel. Mandri watched in terror as the man rode the undone structure down into a billowing cloud of dust, crying prayers up to Solraheen as he went.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri closed his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was a deafening crash, and the air came alive with the tinny screech of stone sliding against stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 After a moment of , Mandri opened his eyes again. He peered down at the chaos from his blessed perch. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see clearly through the swirling rust-colored smoke. Only swatches of color against the ruddy mist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A swarm of white Hrkan cloaks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A sprinkling of black Ayramun rags.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A yell rang out and these two rushed each other. Once again, the battle was joined.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stumbled back from his ledge - there was no clear way to get down. He thought, for a moment, that perhaps it was best to be stuck up in a hole as high as he was. No matter who won, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be safe. He sat down, put his back against what was left of the wall, tucked his knees tight against his chest, and tried to cut, when heard the familiar sound.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink-TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink-TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri could feel the hammer strokes resonate through the rock. He buried his head in between his knees, covered it with his arms, and tried pretend that none of this was happening. While he could effectively shut out the sights and sounds, his sense of equilibrium remained, and it screamed bloody murder as his half of Minting Rock began to tilt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At first it was only a slight shifting as the rock swayed away from the melee below. A loud clap of snapping rock rang out, and Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s perch swayed precariously back the other way. Mandri scrambled to grab hold of something, to stop himself from spilling out of his hole and into the open air, and just as his hip began to slide, a thunderous faulting of joints echoed up from below, and a puff of smoke shot up behind it. The whole terrifying thing swayed away yet again, before settling into a precipitous tilt. What was left of Minting Rock dithered there, letting the terror in Mandri get nice and settled, until, at last, there came a shattering CRACK, and the structure began to fall. Mandri braced himself in that half-shorn tomb as the horizon fell out of the sky.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The whole structure rolled onto its back like a freshly halved melon. Mandri could do nothing but look to the sky and feel useless. If there were clouds they would have been zipping by, but there was only that gradient of blue shifting into a deeper blue, and for the first time ever, Mandri noticed that the desert sky is a bluer blue than any other. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have time to wonder why that was, for amid the rush and tumble, his sight was swallowed up by a cloud of red dust and a suffocating blur of sand and stone. Before Mandri could fully realize the horror being buried alive, the rock wall underneath him snapped, his room split open, and the half holding him sprung loose like a tensioned lever, catapulting him into the air. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri flew like a dart a few yards above the earth. Such was his speed that he smashed right through the brambles of a karkle bush before tumbling into a ragdoll skip along the surface of the hot sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he finally came to a stop, he found himself half buried in a fledgling dune.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He was alive.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He pulled himself free from the sand, spit some of it out of his mouth, coughed a bit of dust out of his lungs, then rubbed his eyes open, and was surprised to see that his scrawny self was still well-put-together. The shoulder which had borne the brunt of impact wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t in some state of dislocation. There weren\u8217\'92t any bones sticking out, at least. And while the lizard bite on his leg was still smarting, the poultice was still there, knotted tight. Everything else was where it was supposed to be. The only thing that really hurt was the left side of his face, which had scraped against the sand. rash on his cheek where his face had scraped against the sand. Still, that was nothing. Considering everything, that was nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He looked over his shoulder, back at the at the settling dust and the crumbling mound of rubble that once was Minting Rock, and he knew that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d survived in the luckiest way. It was a miracle. A miracle coming after a string of miracles. By rights he should be dead three times over. He\u8217\'92d been stabbed in the chest, he\u8217\'92d been chewed up by a drag-belly, and now he\u8217\'92d survived a fall from near the top of a crumbling stone edifice, yet here he was, alive and breathing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Huh,\u8221\'94 Mandri grunted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a such curt grunt, yet inside it was a nugget of something profound: Mandri was starting to consider that he was, in fact, the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He looked up at the sun and sky. The Painted Eunuch. The Eunuch Painter. The Failed Painter. Perhaps that was him. He was being preserved for a purpose. He was invincible. That thought put a smile on his face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He muttered aloud, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whatever you think you are, Mandri, you\u8217\'92re not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And that was the closest he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ever gotten to praising Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Unfortunately, this quiet reverie was disturbed by the rude shout of a Hrkan soldier coming from behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Die, you rangy lizard!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri turned and saw a mustachioed man in a sparkling white cloak running at him with his blade drawn high. Despite the look of fury and rage twisting this soldier\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face, Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t frightened. Actually, he felt a confidence brewing. If he was supposed to be dead three times over, then what was a fourth? If he was the Failed Painter, living through this would add to the proof.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He held up his hands and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I surrender!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier slowed to a march and stomped the rest of the way towards Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pitiful .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man snarled when he saw that Mandri truly had no intention of fighting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Coward,\u8221\'94 he said, then he flicked his sword and said, \u8220\'93Get up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stood up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Walk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Walk where?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man pointed off behind Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder. At first Mandri thought he was pointing at the rubble of Minting Rock, then he noticed, some fifty yards to the right of it, a detachment of Hrkan soldiers. They were standing shoulder to shoulder, twenty-something in all, a fine shout of discipline.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s captor prodded the small of Mandri\u8217\'92s back with the tip of his blade, and Mandri began to walk. As they looped around the rubble, the rubble came alive with unmistakable sounds of battle: breathless shouts of fury, metal clanging against metal, a staccato burst of excited yips, punctuated here and there by a cry of agony.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first actual figure Mandri saw was Moto. The Zosan was crouching atop a tall, slanted chunk of floor, and with one hand he steadied himself, and with the other he deftly waved off three Hrkan spears with his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl came scrambling out from a hole in the rubble nearby, and she stabbed one of the Hrkan bellies with her knife before sprinting into the sandy smoke. Two Hrkan cloaks sprinted after her, but both came suddenly to sudden, fluttering stop after something slammed into their chests. The sound of their deaths was a bone-crunching WHUMP, and the two men collapsed in the middle of the battlefield, a grand death, grandly framed by the two crumbled halves of Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Standing over them was Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The giant was so caked in red dust that he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t look like a creature of flesh and blood, but sand. The upper part of his robe was hanging in tatters over his waistband, and his long black hair was sweeping his shoulders clean as he twirled a blackened, cast iron bar that was nearly as tall as himself - it was a spud bar, with a knob at one end, and a flat chisel head on the other. Mandri knew that bar must weigh at least thirty pounds, yet Ayram twirled it as if it were a toothpick.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All that was left of the Hrkan force sent into this battle, all that Mandri could see, were six young soldiers. These men moved to surround Ayram. They kept their shields up, kept their footwork clean, kept their spears steady under their arms - then Ayram swung his spud bar in a swooping arc, and all discipline went to . The iron bar crunched through the shield arm of one Hrk, and then the chisel-head sliced through the face of another. The rest of the hapless soldiers charged and stabbed, but such was Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s speed that he spun his bar around in time to splinter the shafts of their spears. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Each soldier in turn jumped back to avoid the . One of them picked up a rock and threw it at Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head, and before Mandri could see how Ayram dealt with it, he felt a sharp prodding in his back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get a move on!\u8221\'94 The soldier behind him shouted. The man was evidently unconcerned that his comrades had just suffered terribly. He was more interested in getting Mandri to the Hrkan line. So impatient was he, that he took Mandri by the wrist, upped the pace to a jog, yanking a distracted Mandri along behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When they got to the Hrkan detachment, the soldier threw Mandri down into the sand, then set the cold edge of his blade on the back of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck to keep his head bowed in obeisance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier then pounded his chest twice - the standard Hrkan salute - and then he said, in bark of a well-drilled soldier, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My lord Mayzdariga, I\u8217\'92ve found another skulking bandit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri dared to look up. Standing before him was a child robed in black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo had said that the Mazydariga were child-like, but this was a literal child, a brown-skinned Jandri boy no more than five years old. So short was he, that Mandri, kneeling, could meet him eye to eye. And Obo had said they were twisted creatures, but this child looked tortured, not twisted. In the place of a nose the child wore a flat metallic device in the shape of a nose, and that was riveted onto a leather band, and that was strapped on round the head. The child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes were so bloodshot that the edges seemed on the cusp of bleeding. Even so they were still filled with a childlike curiosity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Next this Mazydariga child was a bald, pudgy . Unlike the other Hrkans, this man wore the garb of a venal palace scribe - a pale blue robe with long, baggy sleeves, and a . He had a soft, chubby look about him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This scribe looked down at Mandri, and with plain derision in his voice, he said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Another coward lurking in the rubble.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then the Mazydariga spoke, if coming a little sluggish from the throat bothered by phlegm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He smells like a Mazydai.\u8221\'94 There was no hint of menace in the child\u8217\'92s words, this was merely a statement of fact. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 the scribe said thoughtfully, before turning to address to soldier who\u8217\'92d captured Mandri. \u8220\'93The Lord told you to fetch the Mazyd\u8217\'92s body, not fetch a sniveling rat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes sir. Yes, my lord.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier saluted again, then ran back towards the corpse of Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As the soldier fluttered away, Mandri found the courage to speak, now that his neck was free from a threatening blade. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My lord, thank you for rescuing me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Mazyadriga child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes went wide in surprise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was a prisoner of these bandits. I\u8217\'92m not with these people, I was captured.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The child looked up at his scribe. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My lord, he is lying to you,\u8221\'94 the scribe said to his little master. \u8220\'93This one is a ruffian, just like the rest of them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is he?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is, my lord. We shall keep him with the other one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribe nodded to a nearby soldier, and the soldier marched over, dragged Mandri to his feet, and led him over to where one of the Ayramun, Seb, was kneeling, hands bound behind his back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was about to kneel beside him, when suddenly, a horn sounded and the whole Hrkan line saluted. The Horn sounded again and the marched towards minting rock. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 By the time they got to the whole bloody scene was laid bare. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Bodies, mostly Hrkan, literred amongst the rubble. Interspersed throughout the rubble were hints of crushed Ayramun; a limp hand sticking from a, shreds of robes and literring the rubble. Everywhere there dried up bodies like the ones in the tomb that Mandri had. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  The only people alive were Ayramun. There weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t many of them. They huddled together in the middle of the arena. Moto, Elrahet, Purl, , and of course, Ayram. They watched the untroubled Hrkans stroll into arena. A Hrkan commander gave a shout, and the so}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribed stepped forth to address the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The battle is over. Lay down your or arms.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Actual expectation this would be done.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Since you have proved yourselves to be ruffians outside the natural laws which governs man, you will be dealt according to the law of beasts, and so you shall be sold in the court of Hababeen, the governor of Eez. If you persist in your barbarity, we shall undress your weight with a dull blade, and feed your trimmings to the pigs.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram makes no motion to surrender.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Regent motions for prisoners brought in.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Toss your weapons on the ground, or you will all be slaughtered, beginning with this skulking coward.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No more lives need be lost here today. Toss your weapons. The light of the law demands it.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Leave? That is impossible. You have consorted with a traitorous Mazyd lord. It is our duty, as faithful Hrks in the service of Solraheen, to see proper justice meted out, whether we lay down our lives to do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A few grumbles amongst the hrks, significantly less convinced of the long arm of justice.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nonsense. How could a troop of thugs capture the power of a full blooded Mazyd?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93From what I understand, there was an ambush.\u8221\'94}
