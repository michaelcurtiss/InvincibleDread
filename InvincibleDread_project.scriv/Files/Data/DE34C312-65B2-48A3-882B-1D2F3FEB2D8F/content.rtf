He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d walked the world for one million years, protecting its beauty, and with Him out of the way it was destroyed and mere one hundred. A drought to ravaged the world above, spreading the Sand\u8217\'92s extent to every corner of the continent. For a time, the Old Jandri world persisted, but then the Ukut river dried up. With the river gone, the tribe called the Gairo could no longer sustain themselves on the Ukut plateau, and so they swept down into the Sand\u8217\'92s Middle Portion. But it was not the Gairo who ended the Old Jandri world, it was the people whom they butchered and displaced\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Hrks. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Hrks wandered the Sand for one thousand years until, at last, Arnaggu led his people out of their suffering and into the Fertile Portion. Little in the way of art or architecture survived their barbarian charm. Every shrine and temple had their arches broken and their eternal flames snuffed out. It is said that the only thing that truly survived in tact was belief in Solraheen, for the Hrks could not deny what they could see with their own eyes, buried there under the crater at the mouth of the river Jek. The Hrks claimed that holy crater as their own, and inside of it they built their city, Jeket. From there, they conquered the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before the Hrks, the Fertile Portion was ruled by an Old Jandri king named Dror. To prove his dominion, Dror placed interlocking blocks of granite two-by-two-by-ten at every bend of the Jek river, and out of these grey columns he carved his long-bearded, long-robed image. The first statue built was built at the Jek\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s source, high up in the Goree mountains overlooking the Shoglok falls. Today it stands there above the crashing water and rising mist looking like a wraith, for it is sanded so smooth by erosion that no discernible feature of Dror remains. He is little more than a grey wither of stone in the general shape of a man, earless and eyeless, watching the sun and moon and stars spin overhead.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Jek river descends down into the foothills where it is guarded by a spate of Drors that have been sanded into smooth, pointed pillars, more like cattle scratch posts than a filigreed statue of a king. Their heads are reduced to conical nubs, their swords worn down to the hilt. The river then pours out of the foothills and down into the brink of Hrkan civilization, where the Drors are somewhat shielded from the erosive wind but were not able to hide from the chisels of recriminate outland men. Further down the river and into on the long and winding plain, Dror\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s component blocks begin to disappear altogether, for the stones are handy materials in the building of pastoral walls. By the time one reaches the most distant city-spawn of Jeket, all that is left of Dror\u8217\'92s monuments are the enormous plinths upon which they once stood, for they are too large for herdsmen to bother with.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Old Jandri statues are disintegrating the nearer they come to Jeket\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there is symbolism here, unsubtle and pointed, and so of course people disagree about what it means. A Hrkan Lord would say that it is a sign of Hrk\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cleansing influence on the old world, while an outlander thinks its a sign of Hrk\u8217\'92s corrupting influence. An outland man\u8217\'92s blood yearns for that storied age when all peoples were rootless, when herds of oxen were free to be chased across the entire continent, when women wove blankets so long they could be wrapped around a village, when men were honest and would cut off their own fingers just to prove that they were sorry.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both sides claim the statues of Dror as symbols of their own magnificence. Sometimes they get to killing over them. To Mandrameen, this was all a bunch of nonsense, and everyone involved was an idiot. It reminded him of the Stria which hangs in the entrance hall of the Temple Krait. This painting is large, two men tall and one wide, and in a technical sense the painting is a masterwork\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the scene overflows with silk-satin of every color, and silk-satin is a challenging material to paint because it inevitably moves, the reflections change, and so most painters make use of mannequins and glue to keep the folds still, but Stria, inspired by Solraheen, could capture its likeness without reference. The actual subject is a white-robed young man and a red-robed young woman standing in a window-lit room. Their postures seem confused, their backs are turned to each-other, yet both look over the shoulder at the other. Some say it depicts a boy preserving his honor by refusing the temptations of the young beauty, while others say it is the girl who preserves her virtue by shunning the advances of a besotted youth. The controversy has led to several murders, even though the Temple accommodates either interpretation, for the temple praises chastity above all other virtues, and surely that is the message, for the temple\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s dome can be seen in the painting, through the window.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a unsubtle signal taking place between the two subjects. The girl is thrusting her thumb between two of her fingers, and the boy accepts by making a circle with this thumb and middle finger. It would seem, then, that the temple\u8217\'92s dome is no chastely crown, it is the watchful eye under which two lovers plan a tryst.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Mandrameen showed these suggestive hands to a temple attendant he was told, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Young man, your mind is overwhelmed with lust.\u8221\'94 While that might have been true it didn\u8217\'92t matter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Stria was clearly intending to make a mockery of all these prudes. And it was much the same with those crumbling statues of Dror\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the pivotal detail that no one cared to notice was that most of those statues were sitting alone out in an empty desert because over the centuries the river Jek had changed its course too many times to count. The statues have nothing to do with Hrk and whether it\u8217\'92s good or bad. Their message is that nothing lasts forever, and while Mandri was sure about everything he was most sure about that. Existence is impermanence.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Consider the facts:}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Solraheen Himself was conquered. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everything living dies.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rivers change their course.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Rivers dry up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Continents dry up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Beauty fades.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Sex rarely lasts longer than a finger.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Paintings brown up and curl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Statues turn to dust.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Everything living dies\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s worth mentioning twice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Once the physical world is exhausted of decay, Mandri could point to the virtual.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ideas are easy to kill\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t try to argue that one. Mandri could easily slip into saying that ideas are easy to corrupt. Try and argue against that}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Innocence is famously easy to kill. In fact, that seems to be the main function of innocence, to be killed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Manhood is easy to kill because it hardly exists in the first place. Same with adulthood. Same with any-hood. They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re all hoods foisted upon a child, and children? Solraheen knows children are easy to kill.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nothing lasts forever.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Minting Rock was another fact to add to this collection, things consigned to oblivion.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Underneath it was a tunnel which led to a sunlit central well drilled straight through the rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s core, and when Mandri looked up and saw a canted column of light shining down into blackness of Minting Rock\u8217\'92s interior, he was smitten with that daunting awe which only comes from contact with a long-forgotten culture. He felt, without exaggeration, that he was standing at the bottom of a broken bead cast off from the necklace of a mountain god. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He grabbed the rope which hung down into the dark, and an out of sight an Ayramun began to pull him up. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet left the floor, bounced off the stone, and soon after they kicked out into a void. Then someone lit a torch and space around him lit up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This first chamber of Minting Rock was an oblong egg shaped room with Mandri hanging out in the middle of it like an uvula. The flatter bottom fifth of this chamber was carved to look like a liquid, with a tide of concentric rings rippling down it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s concave surface into cresting waves, all in miniature, all of it polished to a sheen as smooth as a Hrkan Lord\u8217\'92s table. Amidst this black stone sea were four stone demons, twice Mandri\u8217\'92s size, carved from the solid rock and holding up the ceiling, full and dynamic figures, scaled and snarling, with backs bent against the room\u8217\'92s gentle curve. Mandri might have thought them real if Hill wasn\u8217\'92t there amongst them, torch in hand, rummaging about the packs scattered around the demon\u8217\'92s feet. Despite the unparalleled quality of the craftsmanship on display, the Ayramun were treating the place as a storage space. Hill paid Mandri no mind as the hands above continued to pull Mandri upwards.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The second level of Minting Rock was a bulbous, cylindrical cocoon, eight men tall and five wide, illuminated by two flower-flame oil lamps affixed to either shoulder of a dark and narrow passage to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left. With such a dim glow, much of the room\u8217\'92s detail was lost to blackness, but what Mandri could see was an intricate complexity the likes of which he\u8217\'92d had never encountered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The flat disc of a floor was embossed with a rotationally symmetric diamond pattern, and at the floor\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s edges this pattern extruded smoothly up onto the wall, flowing upwards and splitting into several ribbons of sculptural stone, a weave that criss-crossed in and out of itself creating a fantasy that coupled dazzling geometric intricacy with organic fluidity and pulse. The outer layers cast hard, shifting shadows on the layers underneath. It seemed as if the room were a cage keeping out a kaleidoscopic vision stolen from a burgeon binge and then brought to life, with the outermost layer, the bars of this cage, graduating from a swirl of diamonds into into a prickling fence of barbed thorns, and like a climbing vine they spiraled all the way up the wall and converged towards the center of the ceiling, merging into the lashes of a pyramidal eye whose iris was the open shaft which led ever upwards and into the light of day.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The room smelled like a urinal, unwashed and foul. An unseen hand grabbed a fistful of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s robe in between the shoulder blades and yanked him off the rope. He was then plopped ass-first on to the richly patterned floor and the pain in his thigh reasserted itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d pulled him out was Seb, and the smell was coming from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this place?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This be Minting Rock,\u8221\'94 Seb said as his near-toothless mouth squelched a borcandi spine. He was obviously an old hand at borcandi biting because he carried himself with the borcandi bent\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 as if his muscles were stuck in tension and had been that way for years, shoulders hunched and tight, head knocked forward, limbs all slightly bent as if he\u8217\'92d half-coiled up in fright and rusted that way. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t care about the name,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93What }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  this place? Who made it?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb nudged Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hip with the toe of his shoe, and then he shooed Mandri up against the wall with a few flaps of his fingers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep out of the way,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scooted backwards against the wall and shoved his injured leg flush against against it, so that nothing of him stuck out. It was then that he noticed that Mazyd Obo was in the room with them. The lamplight hardly reached him on the far side of the room, yet his pale head out like a . He was still playing dead, but he kept one eye open, squinting out at the world. When Mandri noticed, Obo winked. \line \tab Mandri chuckled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s funny?\u8221\'94, Seb asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s nothing\u8230\'85Nothing at all.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb looked over at Obo to tried and gauge the meaning of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chuckle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s my leg,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93And honestly, everything else. It all ridiculous.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb turned away from Obo and stared down at Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s blood-drunk leg.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The demon that bit you, what\u8217\'92d it look like?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Actually, it looked a bit like those statues down below.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri went on to describe the demon that bit him, as best as he could remember, black teeth and all. As he laid out the extent of the horror, Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s borcandi spine slowly slipped out of his lip and dropped to the floor, and when Mandri finished describing the feeling of the demon\u8217\'92s toxin squeezing his insides, Seb gulped, realized he\u8217\'92d dropped his spine, and then fumbled around in his own shadow for it. Eventually he found it, pinched that slobbery mess back up and stuffed it right back in his cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I been out here thirty somethin\u8217\'92 years,\u8221\'94 Seb said as he rolled the borcandi around his mouth with his tongue, \u8220\'93an I never seen no demon like that. Nothin\u8217\'92 nearly like a man. Demons come in all kinds\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 lizard-like, beetle-like, bird-like\u8230\'85mostly small-like. Man-demons crawlin\u8217\'92 out the ground is a bad sign.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well that\u8217\'92s not the first demon I\u8217\'92ve seen like that.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s brow scrunched up and he stared down at Mandri like Mandri were a liar.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bullshit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m serious,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93Except this demon was a woman not a man. And I mean a straight up woman, an old woman, no fangs or claws or anything, just an old woman.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sounds like you saw an old woman then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 turned into }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 a demon. I saw her tear open an ox\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest and suck its Spark out its stomach. It was horrible.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You didn\u8217\'92t see shit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But I did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a burgeon binger.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I saw what I saw, burgeons have nothing to do with it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Boy, I binge burgeons, an when I see folks turn into demons I don\u8217\'92t go believin it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s admission to binging burgeons set Mandri\u8217\'92s stomach itching, because any self-respecting burgeon binger is likely to have a few bulbs in their pocket. Mandri had to stop himself from glancing. He could not, however, stop himself from asking.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You have burgeons?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It sounded too desperate. Dying had quelled his bone-crave for burgeons, but there was still little hole in the pit of his stomach which food or water couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t fill. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb squatted down, brought his gaunt and pitted face even with Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s, and like any self-respecting burgeon binger, he dodged the question.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You didn\u8217\'92t see no woman turn into no demon"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But I did.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Now that Seb was low the neck of his robe was yawning at Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s nose, and the man\u8217\'92s odor was pouring out\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 it smelled like butter gone bad.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seein\u8217\'92 one demon is seein\u8217\'92 one demon\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s fine. Seein\u8217\'92 two is seein\u8217\'92 too many. It starts to look like it means somethin\u8217\'92. So don\u8217\'92t tell nobody you saw some ole bitch turn into a demon. If anyone asks, the demon that bit you is the only demon you ever seen\u8230\'85cause what you think we do to folks that\u8217\'92s friendly with \u8216\'91em?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Man, you smell.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb stood back up and wilted. Even a hard-up outland man couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t abide being found out like that. A man\u8217\'92s face could be ugly as mud, that was the world\u8217\'92s fault\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 but his smell, his smell was coming from the inside and it said something about him without his meaning. A bad smell is the one thing that can make a street-sleeper feel shame, even four days deep in a burgeon binge. A bad smell is a secret he\u8217\'92s got to keep.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Fine,\u8221\'94 Seb declared. \u8220\'93You do what you do and that\u8217\'92s what you supposed to do. That\u8217\'92s what you always goin to do, itten it? I don\u8217\'92t give a damn.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tired eyes managed to impress upon Mandri his great disappointment. Of course, Mandri didn\u8217\'92t care because Seb was a nobody amongst nobodies, as irrelevant as one of Jeket\u8217\'92s crawlers\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 men who beg from beggars. Mandri had a sense for these people even if they hadn\u8217\'92t yet fallen that far. There\u8217\'92s an ineffable dopiness about them, the face kind of sags, and when they talk, they talk about stupid shit and they look scared while doing it because they're worried their words will have them out. They bite hard on borcandi spines and burgeons to keep from talking. And they smell. To a man and woman, they smell.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A shrill whistle rang out from the oculus above. A heartbeat later, and Minting Rock was alive with the sounds Ayramun\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 footfalls echoing through the rock, shouts muffled and deepened by unseen corridors, as if a doorbell had just been rung and the household staff was flung into a muster. Hill came climbing up the well-shaft rope, body slinking up and up like a caterpillar, and without so much as nod he disappeared into the chamber above.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was about to ask what was going on, when there came, sounding of the passage to his left, a chink of metal on stone repeating in time with a stride growing louder as it neared this central chamber. Mandri stared at the dim-lit passage, peered into the shadow of its throat, when suddenly Ayram burst into view, beard-jutting and wild-eyed. In his hand was a long staff of black-iron, two-heads taller than himself, barely clearing the passage ceiling. One end of this bar was cast into a sphere the size of his great fist, and the other end was a spike which bit into the polished floor as the giant marched into the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram was not alone, Moto followed him, and waddling in behind Moto was the short old witch Elrahet. She lingered there in the passage mouth, under the flickering lamps, and her dark hood cast a long, hard shadow which hid her eyes from view. Mandri watched her as she watched Ayram. There was a familiarity to her profile that he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t quite place, though old folks tend to all look alike even though they look nothing alike. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She caught him staring. She turned her whole hooded head towards him, slow as a , and Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes went fleeing at the speed of shame. It was a mere glancing exchange, and Mandri hadn\u8217\'92t seen her eyes under the black of her hood, yet he could feel her gaze stir up his stomach.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Meanwhile Ayram and Moto were standing over Obo, one on either side, with Obo lost in their shadow. Moto kicked. A dull crack sounded out\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 no doubt another broken rib for Obo. Moto steadied himself against the wall and was about to deliver another rough kick to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest, when Elrahet told him to stop.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s already awake,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto stepped back to let the light in, and indeed, there was Obo with his eyes open, blinking at the world around him as if he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d woken up into a dream. He did a good job at pretending to look surprised and even a little hurt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram had no sympathy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me how you did it,\u8221\'94 he growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo looked up at the giant, regarded him with contempt. He then said, voice hoarse, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What did I do?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram said nothing. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t need to. A man of his size, simply standing still, was enough of a statement.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head dropped, as if his neck were so weak it couldn\u8217\'92t bear the burden of such a sight. He was really playing for sympathy here, but no one was biting. He said, \u8220\'93I know it can be difficult, sometimes, to draw a clear line between cause and effect, but blaming me for anything is ?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram let his iron bar slip down his fist. The fat spike hit the stone floor right next to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hip.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was unimpressed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 You\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92re}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  the one that captured me and brought me here. If I\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve caused you any trouble, then you\u8217\'92ve brought it upon yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram remained silent. Mandri figured the passive threat might have been very scary, but he suspected Obo was incapable of feeling fear so he doubted it was having the desired effect. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I may take a moment to ask\u8230\'85what is it you planned to do with me?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This faffing about drew a long breath and a few words from the giant. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Time is short,\u8221\'94 he said. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s why I\u8217\'92m asking now. This could be my only chance for closure... I\u8217\'92m a curious creature. I have to know.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With a twist of his wrist, Ayram set the iron spike to rest against Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s collar bone. The weight of it almost tipped Obo over. Obo sighed, shrugged it off, and Ayram set it right back on the bone. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did you honestly believe that a Hrkan Lord would make a weapon as powerful as me without devising a way to track me down should I get loose?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto was enduring this exchange with the same impatience of a child. He broke Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s tactical silence by blurting out, \u8220\'93They can track you down to anywhere?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hairless brows jumped in disbelief. \u8220\'93Have you truly never heard of the Mazydariga?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had never heard of the Mazydariga, and judging by the dumbfounded expression in Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes, and the shrug in Moto\u8217\'92s shoulders, neither men had heard of it either. Since none of them were willing to admit to not knowing something, an uneasy silence grew between them, until Elrahet grumbled aloud and said, \u8220\'93Riga means shadow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto bent down and began to examine Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow for a sign of some obscure magic. Obo pushed him away with an elbow. \u8220\'93Not my literal shadow,\u8221\'94 he said with disdain for Moto\u8217\'92s simplicity. \u8220\'93A Mazydariga is a creature. They are grown alongside the Mazydai\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 other than that, and the fact that they are bred with the intent of hunting me down, I know nothing of them. Evidently you don\u8217\'92t either\u8230\'85and I see this foils at least one aspect of your plan\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 you hoped to hide from the Hrks, but that is not possible so long as you hold onto me. I wonder, if you }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 could}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  have hid, what would you have done with me?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moto.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get the boys blooded up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo sat there smiling. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re going to fight?\u8221\'94 he asked. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s very brave.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Neither man paid him any heed. Moto jumped onto the well-shaft rope and climbed out of sight, whilst Ayram turned to Seb, and Seb, anticipating a word from his leader, stepped forward.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take the boy and the Mazyd up into a haspex.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb bowed in deference as Ayram and Elrahet swept out of the chamber and back into the passage from whence they came. Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s iron staff clinked against the stone as he went, though soon the sound was lost amongst the yip and din of an outland tribe preparing to fight a battle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb grabbed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wrist and yanked him to his feet, then he hurried over to Obo and made a fuss about wrapping up Obo\u8217\'92s wounds so that Mazyd blood wouldn\u8217\'92t taint his person. Once Obo was swaddled up tight in his own ragged robe, Seb picked him up and carried him under-arm like a freshly-wrapped package of cheese. He then disappeared into the dark passage, then popped back out and motioned for Mandri to follow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri followed Seb into the yawning passage, limping fiercely, steadying himself against the sculptured stone, but he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t keep up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hurry up!\u8221\'94 Seb cried as he doubled back and took ahold of Mandri\u8217\'92s wrist. He pulled Mandri towards a sputtering lamp whose light flooded up a chubby set of curling stairs. Ascending these put an odd twist in Mandri\u8217\'92s mental map of the place, and it became difficult to maintain a sense of where he was within the of the rock. There was almost no light, and he was shoved through so many dark and twisting passages that all he knew for certain was that he was moving away from the center. Every new chamber and corridor became more cluttered and cramped, and the stonework less polished and more rough\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the walls were still sculpted into an otherworldly weave but Mandri\u8217\'92s fingers could feel an inattention to thickness and edge. It was clumsy work, clumsy in comparison to what he\u8217\'92d seen in that central shaft. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri got to thinking, after bumping his head on an absurdly low door frame, that whoever had carved out this rock had perhaps carved out too much of it. From the outside, Minting Rock already looked unstable, like a god-sized bliggu nut standing tip-toe on it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stubby stem. Unless Old Jandri tribesmen were as learned as royal Hrkan architects in the art of stressing stone, the whole thing was bound to fall apart. The further out Mandri went, the more slapdash the passages and rooms became. By the time he saw a slit of blue sky though an embrasure, his toes and fingers were stumbling upon stress cracks in the floors and walls. Once, in this dusty dark, he bumped his shoulder against an unworked wooden beam that arched over his head and he could swear he saw the floor above buckle and sag.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He was pushed into a long and narrow room, long enough for him to lay down in and too narrow, almost, to turn around. This closet had access to outside air through a stippled pattern of finger-sized holes bored into the far wall. The sun didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t shine directly through them, so these pinpricks of day sat on the black rock wall illuminating nothing, like a constellation of stars. They composed an Old Jandri pattern\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a simple, eight-flamed sun. It was the traditional symbol of Solraheen, before the Hrks built Jeket on top of him and put their own sign, an eight-fold compass rose, in the middle of it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb elbowed Mandri into this shoulder-squeezing closet, and that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s when the room\u8217\'92s defining quality hit him\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 though the air outside was a breath away, the air inside was thick with a foul smell, sweet and horrible, cloying, as if a mound of peaches had been left to putrefy in some dark corner. Mandri gagged, clutched at his nose, and when the spicy bitterness stung his tongue like rancid burgeon bile he spat and choked. It was ten times worse than what he\u8217\'92d whiffed of Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He thought, at first, that this was some kind of prayer room and that the smell was put here to trigger his spiritual impulse, because that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what prayer room incense was supposed to do. He didn\u8217\'92t entertain the thought that this scent was meant to mask a fouler smell until he reached out into the dark to steady himself, and instead of slapping against rock, his fingers sank into something that felt curiously like skin. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He yelped and recoiled. A shock of fright ran through him as he bounced into the opposite wall where his other hand brushed up against dried and bony limb. He yelped again, and prayed fast that Solraheen would adjust his eyes to the darkness. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d have pulled out his own Spark out to see.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb slapped the back of his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep your hands to yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s in here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t worry it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb pushed Mandri towards the stipple-pricked sigil of Solraheen, and Mandri caught himself against this blessed wall. He sniffed the air, and now that his nose was curious it found out the tang of rotting flesh being smothered by incense smoke.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He turned to protest his new accommodation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sit down and be quiet,\u8221\'94 Seb commanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before Mandri could frame his dissent, a dark shape flew towards him and crashed into his stomach. He wheezed, went sprawling against the wall and sank down to floor. He fumbled around in the dark and squealed in disgust when his thumb poked through a stiff and gristly cloth and dove into something with the consistency of fire-crusted jelly. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d just plumbed his thumb into Obo\u8217\'92s stumped thigh. He didn\u8217\'92t realize it until Obo\u8217\'92s airy laugh came giggling out from under his armpit.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get off me!\u8221\'94 Mandri shrieked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I hardly can,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m wrapped up tight.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri picked Obo up, easy to do because Obo was almost as light as two-year old.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put me down.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Stop wiggling.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not, you\u8217\'92re shaking me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no where to put you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Quit your talkin,\u8221\'94 Seb said, casually annoyed. \u8220\'93And stop touchin shit. This is a sacred place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandi didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t want to get slapped so he shut up and stuffed Obo in between his good right leg and the wall. He had to bunch himself up closer to the other side and that was a dicey proposition, because something dead was resting there and he didn\u8217\'92t want his wound rubbing up against it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A diffuse glow of lamplight came acreeping up corridor wall from behind Seb. Seb spun around and there was the girl Purl, standing in the room\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s entrance, looking like she\u8217\'92d just picked herself up from rolling down a dune, robes sandy as a sandflea, with a puff of bedraggled hair sprouting out like weedbush from a wide black bandanna. The red kell oil smeared on her face made picked up the warm light and made it seem as if her cheeks were scraped of skin.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri had almost forgotten she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d existed. He recalled her screaming at Obo to kneel back in that pit cave a day or two before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She peered around Seb at Mandri, as if looking for him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Move,\u8221\'94 she said to Seb. Seb begrudgingly stepped out of the room to give her the space to enter. As she did, the oil-dish lamp she held before her splayed its light out onto the room\u8217\'92s interior, bringing this haunting \u8216\'91closet\u8217\'92 to life.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Cut into the black rock walls were coffin-sized slits, three on either side, stacked one above the other. Inside each of these, resting in a peaceful repose, was a corpse, each in a different stage of decomposition, and each naked as come from the womb, and all of them, as far as Mandri could tell, were giant men, Ayram-sized men, with beards black and grey.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The corpse the light lit clearest was as black and shriveled as a grape weeks fallen from the vine. It was impossible to say for certain how long that body had been laying there, for an unbothered corpse in the Sand could last an age, but cloistered away in Minting Rock, sheltered from the wind and abrasion, Mandri figured that a corpse could last for as long as Solraheen willed it. That body could be as ancient as the world itself\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85only, ancient corpses don\u8217\'92t smell\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 at least Mandrameen didn\u8217\'92t think they did. At least one of these graves had to be recently inhumed. Probably, it was the first one he\u8217\'92d touched\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 middle hole on the right hand wall. From what he could see of that corpse, it didn\u8217\'92t seem particularly fresh, though from his position on the floor he could only see bits and pieces\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a dessicated hand with purple-black fingers, shadows licking at a dry, pruned up shoulder, all of it frosted by a layer of dust. Nothing fresh about it. No hint of bloat, no tar-like iridescence of fresh rot that might explain the smell.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Mandri looked down and saw the spreading rot in his own leg and he wondered if the smell was coming from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl set her lamp down in a shallow recess carved for the purpose, waist-high up the wall to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left. With her other arm\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 her handless arm\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 she was clutching a basket of mentionables close to her chest, and this she set on the floor at Mandri\u8217\'92s feet. She squatted down and began to unload it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 first out was a puffy square of grey wool folded into itself. Next was a bundle of damp leaves knotted at the stems. Then came a stone mortar which tinked against the floor. Last came three small alabastron jars that were packed to the brim with waxy substances, one yellow, one red, and one white. Purl hesitated with these, treated them more gently than the rest. Once all all these things were arrayed out before her, she handed the basket back to Seb, who tucked it mindlessly into one of the corpsedens.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see the bite,\u8221\'94 she said to Mandri.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri drew up his robe, leaned onto his right ass cheek, and rolled his wounded thigh into the light. The poultice was looking especially wrinkled and sloppy, hanging half off. Purl eyed the dark veins in his leg with a keen interest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Would you look at that,\u8221\'94 she muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was now standing behind her, hovering over her shoulder, chewing on a fresh borcandi spine. He was munching right by her ear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re blocking the light,\u8221\'94 Purl snipped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb moved back, then cleared his phlegmy throat and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t do anything yet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This needs to be cured. Now.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want to question him first.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You two can talk while I\u8217\'92m working.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl pulled a thumb-sized pestle from her ruddy robes and she dolloped a two-finger-dip of each of the three waxes into her mortar. Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s one good hand wasn\u8217\'92t used to doing two things at the same time, so each time she clawed wax from a jar, the jar slid and teetered on its base, and each time she had to catch it, her left arm hanging in the air like a useless friend.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said stop,\u8221\'94 Seb pecked. \u8220\'93Only fix him up if he talks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I have to do this now or there will be permanent changes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl peeled back the old poultice from Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s leg to reveal the black wound underneath. It was an awful sight, smothered over with that mucky paste, but Mandri was more concerned with Purl\u8217\'92s choice of words. It would have made more sense for her to say that his leg risked permanent damage. Permanent Change? His mind immediately leapt to a\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 he was bit by a demon, so that must mean he was turning into a demon. And it was easy, in this light, to see things that might not really be there, the festering skin around the wound might not be turning into a scaly lizard hide. He was suddenly in want of a mirror.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If he goes permanent, he goes permanent.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Thank you for the insight,\u8221\'94 Purl said dryly.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s going permanent?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked, and Purl\u8217\'92s dark eyes flicked up and met his. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t worry about it,\u8221\'94 she said. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What did you mean by permanent changes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb crowded back into the light, slurped up his saliva, then said, tongue swimming under the consonants, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She say on\u8217\'92t worry ih.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl pushed Seb back with a miffed look and then set herself back to mixing the medicine in the mouth of her mortar. She poured a fingerfull of water from her personal waterskin into it, finger-swirled it around with the wax, then plucked three leaves and dropped them onto the swimming globs of color. She began to knead it all into a paste. Mandri watched with eager intent, and so did Obo. Obo leaned over Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s legs, trying to peer into the mixture, but since he was hardly more than a ribcage swiveling on hips, \u8216\'91leaning\u8217\'92 was a chancy thing. Mandri had to catch him to keep him from tipping over, and this commotion interrupted Purl\u8217\'92s rhythmic flow. She stopped kneading and gave Obo the same miffed look she\u8217\'92d given Seb a moment before.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought wax was insoluble in water.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Must not be wax,\u8221\'94 said Purl, and she resumed smashing the bits of leaves down into the sopping goop. By now the colors were beginning to mix, turning a greenish shade of brown that looked nearly black in the lamplight. Obo was polite enough to wait until she was finished to ask, \u8220\'93Would you mind if I tasted it?\u8221\'94.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The disgust in Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face was absolute, with thin lines wearing into her forehead that told Mandri this disgust was a look she wore often\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 most outland women end up this way, from first blood they\u8217\'92re fighting wars of aggravation against outland men, only here the nuisance was a Mazyd not a man, and he wasn\u8217\'92t rebuffed in the usual way. His eyes were bright, expecting entertainment. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb crowded once more into the light. In his hand was a knife with a blade as long as  the string of spit which dangled unawares from the corner of his lip. He handled the knife playfully, limp-wristed, swinging it in and out of his own cast shadow. Twice, the handle threatened to slip out of his seemingly careless fingers. Mandri flinched, but If Obo was concerned about the blade slicing into his stomach, he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t show it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t like listenin to you talk,\u8221\'94 Seb said, with a little more diction. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no need for hostility,\u8221\'94 said Obo, and this drew a hiss from Seb\u8217\'92s cheek.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You killed good people in those hills,\u8221\'94 he said as he swung the blade towards Obo\u8217\'92s nose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93They were shooting arrows at me.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can hardly blame me for acting in self-defense.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes flashed thunder and his jaw went stiff. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t mean to offend you,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m not calling you a coward.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb sipped a,. He was man who couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t leave a conversation without making sure that he, but as he was too dim to think of something clever, he huffed, and stormed out of the narrow tomb to go and take up arms against the coming Skelsi.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His leaving left a void of purpose in the air, and Mandri decided seized the moment by inserting himself into the conversation with all the bluster and arrogance of a churchmouse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, uh, what kind of changes were you referring to?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl glared at him as she sopped the old poultice paste from his wound with a rag.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come on,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93you can\u8217\'92t talk and work at the same time?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I never jumped into that pit,\u8221\'94 Mandri said defensively. \u8220\'93Moto threw me in.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo in shock and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not true.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He also told me he never lies, so he definitely lies all the time.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl then poured the contents of her mortar onto the clean strap of wool, and spread it over the width of it with her thumb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m just trying to earn your trust.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo scoffed. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You would earn her trust by betraying mine?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl wraps up and leaves. Clearly doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t give a fuck.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, honesty without discretion causes more problems than it solves. That\u8217\'92s doubly true with these people. The truth has to be applied with precision until they count you as one of them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I know what I\u8217\'92m doing.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not the best strategy here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh? And what is?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo brushed his robe open to reveal the scar running down his sternum. He pointed at it and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It was Purl who cut me open. Then she cut off her own hand and buried it in my chest. As we speak, her fingers are gripping my heart. Her intention was to bind me to her will.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Her hand is in your chest?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It is. That is how a Minder becomes a Minder. They wield a Mazyd with their dominate hand.

Believe me when I tell you that I know what a will without kindness }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 feels}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  like. Purl is different. We can reach the girl through her kindness.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face went blank. Mandri took to be how a Mazyd must look when they\u8217\'92re trying to understand something incomprehensible.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo finally said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you implying that the experience of \u8216\'91kindness\u8217\'92 is restricted to creatures of like kind?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The sound set Mandri on edge and it stirred up Minting Rock. Yips and hollers rang out as the Ayramun barked their excitement, a den of foxes.

He stood up, gingerly, pushing himself up against the narrow walls, then turned and looked through one of the small holes in the exterior wall behind him. He couldn\u8217\'92t see much, but there, sure enough, set against a field of sand was a white-robed column of men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This is what I\u8217\'92m talking about, Obo. Kindness is how a kind treats it own\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 friendly, generous, but also brutal. This is going to be a massacre.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Most likely. Thirteen against seventy-five is long odds.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You know, that would be true for the first few Mazydai ever made. Their magicked pseudosparks were completely absent all color\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they couldn\u8217\'92t feel emotion. Black Sparks, if you can believe it.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can\u8217\'92t say for certain, but I have a theory.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s hear it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Even the most crude pseudospark has an innate desire to connect with another Spark. Robbed of emotion, those early Mazydai were robbed of the means of forming that connection. They must have felt some sense of absence, loneliness\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 they must\u8217\'92ve felt broken.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s theory didn\u8217\'92t make much sense to Mandri. He couldn\u8217\'92t understand how feeling broken or lonely could mean anything if you couldn\u8217\'92t also feel sad. A rock doesn\u8217\'92t mind being shattered. A bob-eyed lizard doesn\u8217\'92t mind getting lost, in fact they seem to prefer it. He was about to another, when a shrill whistle pierced his thoughts and pushed out all other conerns. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was not a sound that Mandri had ever heard. It was a metallic, tinny tone that quivered like a strandtail\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s warble, only it was ten times louder and harsher than the shriek of a hawk. The sound cut through the rock so clearly that its source might as well have been in the room. It was an ear-splitting pain for Mandri, but it was doing something deadlier to Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was collapsed on the floor, squirming. His eyes were rolling around in their sockets, twitching and turning as if something inside his skull was stabbing at his ocular nerve. Suddenly, the whistling jumped to a higher pitch and Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whole body began to convulse. Mandri reached out to keep Obo\u8217\'92s head from thumping against the stone, but before he could do anything, Obo\u8217\'92s stomach wretched, his chest heaved, and a dim blue formless ember shot out from his mouth, leaving his body limp and lifeless. The strange light hovered just above Obo\u8217\'92s lips for the briefest spell, then the whistling shifted its register again, higher still into a pitch reserved for , and the blue ember shot right towards Mandrameen\u8217\'92s head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri ducked out of the way and the ember whizzed past his neck, its energy scorching his skin as it went. It continued on to punch a hole the size of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fist into the rock behind him, and Mandri spun around just in time to watch it zip up into the sky. He lost sight of it for a moment against the deep blue, then found it again as it dove towards the distant Hrkan column. As it fell, the whistling fell to a drowning timbre, until, with a flash, the light and the whistling were snuffed out altogether, as if swallowed up by a short, black-robed childlike figure standing at the head of the Hrkan column.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ears could recover their tuning, the Hrkan horn of war sounded again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 BWWWAAAAAAAWWWWW-oooooooo000000000000mmmmm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The deep bellow shook Mandri out of his skin. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard the horn once already, but this time, this time he knew the horn was blowing for him. Terror welled up in his gut.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He could see the Hrkan column so clearly now. It was flattening out to a square, and as soon as that square was made solid, a command was barked, and the soldiers began their advance, bracing their white, oblong shields up against the rain of arrows that was sure to come.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Twenty paces later, and the arrows flew out from Minting Rock. It felt to Mandri like the rock had come alive, like he was inside the stomach of a lumbering ridgeback lizard shooting it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s quills at an onrushing Hrkan snake, and while most of the arrows bounced harmlessly off the Hrkan hide, some snuck in between the scales, wounding the creature, marked here and there by the sudden tumbling of one of the Hrkan number and the triumphant whoops and yips of the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 These little victories did nothing to slow the Hrkan advance. Every gap opened by the death of one soldier was closed in rhythmic time. Left, right, left, reform. Left, right, left, reform. No stumbling. No gap between the lines was permitted to for long.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Inside of Minting Rock there was a flurry of activity. Mandri could hear the Ayramun sprinting from room to room, trying to find a better angled hole to fire upon their target. Some who scampered by Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burial chamber were ferrying bundles of arrows from one shooting nest to another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb rushed by, then stumbled backwards, noticing the new hole in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Move out of the way!\u8221\'94 he shouted, and ran in, kicking Obo\u8217\'92s lifeless body to the side, then squatted down and started firing arrows down at the marching men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A gleam in Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eye, total fixation on the task, gleam when the, }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Not being able to see what was going turned Mandri into an anxious wreck. He knew the Hrkans would be at the rock soon, but what they would do, how many the Ayramun would kill, how . Then Mandri heard a noise which}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink-TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What was that?\u8221\'94 Seb wondered aloud.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sounds like a fucking chisel,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink-TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb turned around, eyes wide in alarm. Then he shoved Mandri aside and leapt back into the tunnels. Mandri made to follow, but Seb stopped him with a shove on the shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri began to argue, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If there\u8217\'92s a way out-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shut up and stay put!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Reluctantly, Mandri scurried back to the hole in the wall and tried his best to make sense of the situation. Directly below was a bevy of upturned shields, in the center of each, the gold-eyed Hrkan sun, looking up at him with dumb indifference.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 DINK-DINK-DINK}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The chiseling was getting louder, faster. Then, echoing up the tunnels, the first roars men possessed by the spirit of battle. Somewhere far below, in that entrance well, limbs were getting hacked to pieces.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then came a loud crack\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the snap of sandstone snapping. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CRACKKKKkkkk-kkk-kkkkkk-k.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The whole of Minting Rock lurched. Mandri stumbled, felt the rumble of the structure beginning to collapse under his feet. The sound of crunching rock echoed round like the peal of distant thunder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then all went silent.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 No shouts of struggle. No chiseling. No clash of sword on shield. Even the sandfleas gnawing on loose grain stopped and swirled their antennae, sensing an ominous in the air.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CHINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A long, jagged crack exploded into the floor of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burial chamber. Minting Rock lurched again, and the dust of ages shook loose from the ceiling, as if the room above had been hammered by Solraeen\u8217\'92s fist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted. \u8220\'93Obo, wake the fuck up!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With a jolt, the crack in the floor opened wider, then a thunderous boom sent the crack darting across the length of the room, fracturing the chamber in two. A eyeblink later and the chamber\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whole left side slid down an inch before coming to a rest on some new foundation of rubble far, far below.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri, fear pulsing in chest, yanked one of the aged corpses out its resting place and tossed it onto the ground. He then grabbed Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm and threw him into the now unoccupied grave. He pushed the Obo as far towards the back as he could, stuffing his noodle-like arms under his body, then Mandri crawled in alongside him. The very moment that Mandri tucked in his legs, the ceiling started to collapse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first thing to go was Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s clay oil lamp. It jostled loose from its ceiling hook and smashed onto the floor, splashing licks of oil and flame about the room. Then the walls shook, and the seams in the ceiling burst, shooting a jet of smoke into the room, flooding Mandri\u8217\'92s grave, obscuring the air so completely that Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t see the hail of stone crashing down. What he did see, after wiping the dust from his eyes, was the awesome sight of Minting Rock split in half like a geode.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before his shock could even register, the opposite half began to fall away. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Haunting screams split the air as those Ayramun stuck on the wrong side of Minting Rock grasped their impending doom. Almost directly across from where Mandri stood, a ragged, fear-stricken man straddled the half-shorn wall of what once was a tunnel. Mandri watched in terror as the man rode the undone structure down into a billowing cloud of dust, crying prayers up to Solraheen as he went.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri closed his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was a deafening crash, and the air came alive with the tinny screech of stone sliding against stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lord, our Lord,\u8221\'94 Mandri prayed, \u8220\'93 \u8220\'93.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri opened his eyes again. He peered down at the chaos from his blessed perch. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t much through the swirling rust-colored smoke down below.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then, as the smoke lifted\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A swarm of white Hrkan cloaks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A sprinkling of black Ayramun rags.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They were moving.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A yell rang out and the two splotches of color rushed each other. Once again, the battle was joined.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stumbled back from his ledge\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there was no clear way to get down. He thought, for a moment, that perhaps it was best to be stuck up in this high hole. No matter who won, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be safe. He sat down, put his back against what was left of the wall, tucked his knees tight against his chest, and tried to cut, when heard the familiar sound.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink-TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink-TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This time Mandri could feel the chisel strokes resonate through the rock. He buried his head in between his knees, covered it with his arms, and tried pretend that none of this was happening. While he could effectively shut out the sights and sounds, his sense of equilibrium remained, and it screamed bloody murder as his half of Minting Rock began to tilt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At first it was only a slight shifting as the rock swayed away from the melee below. Then a loud clap of snapping rock rang out, and Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s perch swayed precariously back the opposite direction. Mandri scrambled to grab hold of something, to stop himself from spilling out of his hole and into the open air, and just as his hip began to slide, a thunderous faulting of joints echoed up from below, and a puff of smoke shot up behind it. The whole terrifying thing swayed away yet again, before settling into an unstable, precipitous tilt. What was left of Minting Rock dithered there, letting the terror in Mandri get nice and settled, until, at last, there came a shattering CRACK, and the structure began to fall. Mandri braced himself in that half-shorn tomb as the horizon fell out of the sky.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The whole structure rolled onto its back like a freshly halved melon. Mandri could do nothing but look to the sky and feel useless. If there were clouds they would have been zipping by, but there was only that gradient of blue shifting into a deeper blue, and for the first time ever, Mandri noticed that the desert sky is a bluer blue than any other. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have time to wonder why that was, for amid the rush and tumble, his sight was swallowed up by a cloud of black-red dust and a suffocating blur of sand and stone. Before Mandri could fully realize the horror of being buried alive, the rock wall underneath him snapped, his room split open, and the half holding him sprung loose like a tensioned lever, catapulting him into the air. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri flew like a dart a few yards above the earth. He flew like that demon woman Pell flew at his ox, Gil. Such was his speed that he smashed right through the brambles of a karkle bush before tumbling into a ragdoll skip along the surface of the hot sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he finally came to a stop, he found himself half buried in a fledgling dune.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He was alive.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He pulled himself free from the sand, spit some of it out of his mouth, coughed a bit of dust out of his lungs, then rubbed his eyes open, surprised to see that his scrawny self was still well-put-together. The shoulder which had borne the brunt of impact wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even dislocated. There weren\u8217\'92t any bones sticking out, at least. And while the demon bite on his leg was still smarting, Purl\u8217\'92s poultice was still knotted tight. Everything else was where it was supposed to be. The only thing that really hurt was the left side of his face, which had scraped against the sand. Still, that was nothing. Considering everything, that was nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He looked over his shoulder, back at the at the settling dust and the crumbling mound of rubble that once was Minting Rock, and he knew that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d survived in the luckiest way. It was a miracle. A miracle coming after a string of miracles. By rights he should be dead three times over. He\u8217\'92d been stabbed in the chest, he\u8217\'92d been chewed up by a drag-belly, and now he\u8217\'92d survived a fall from near the top of a crumbling stone edifice, yet here he was, alive and breathing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Huh,\u8221\'94 Mandri grunted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a such curt grunt, yet inside it was a nugget of something profound: Mandri was starting to consider that he was, in fact, the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He looked up at the sun and sky. The Painted Eunuch. The Eunuch Painter. The Failed Painter. Perhaps that was him. He was being preserved for a purpose. He was invincible. That thought put a smile on his face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He muttered aloud, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whatever you think you are, Mandri, you\u8217\'92re not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And that was the closest he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ever gotten to praising Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Unfortunately, this quiet reverie was disturbed by the rude shout of a Hrkan soldier coming from behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Die, you rangy lizard!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri turned and saw a mustachioed man in a sparkling white cloak running at him with his blade drawn high. Despite the look of fury and rage twisting this soldier\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face, Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t frightened. Actually, he felt a confidence brewing. If he was supposed to be dead three times over, then what was a fourth? If he was the Failed Painter, living through this would add to the proof.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He held up his hands and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I surrender!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier slowed to a march and stomped the rest of the way towards Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pitiful .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man snarled when he saw that Mandri truly had no intention of fighting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Coward,\u8221\'94 he said, then he flicked his sword and said, \u8220\'93Get up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stood up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Walk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Walk where?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man pointed off behind Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder. At first Mandri thought he was pointing at the rubble of Minting Rock, then he noticed, some fifty yards to the right of it, a detachment of Hrkan soldiers. They were standing shoulder to shoulder, twenty-something in all, a fine shout of discipline.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s captor prodded the small of Mandri\u8217\'92s back with the tip of his blade, and Mandri began to walk. As they looped around the rubble, the rubble came alive with unmistakable sounds of battle: breathless shouts of fury, metal clanging against metal, a staccato burst of excited yips, punctuated here and there by a cry of agony.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first actual figure Mandri saw was Moto. The Zosan was crouching atop a tall, slanted chunk of floor, and with one hand he steadied himself, and with the other he deftly waved off three Hrkan spears with his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl came scrambling out from a hole in the rubble nearby, and she stabbed one of the Hrkan bellies with her knife before sprinting into the sandy smoke. Two Hrkan cloaks sprinted after her, but both came suddenly to sudden, fluttering stop after something slammed into their chests. The sound of their deaths was a bone-crunching WHUMP, and the two men collapsed in the middle of the battlefield, a grand death, grandly framed by the two crumbled halves of Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Standing over them was Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The giant was so caked in red dust that he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t look like a creature of flesh and blood, but sand. The upper part of his robe was hanging in tatters over his waistband, and his long black hair was sweeping his shoulders clean as he twirled a blackened, cast iron bar that was nearly as tall as himself - it was a spud bar, with a knob at one end, and a flat chisel head on the other. Mandri knew that bar must weigh at least thirty pounds, yet Ayram twirled it as if it were a toothpick.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All that was left of the Hrkan force sent into this battle, all that Mandri could see, were six young soldiers. These men moved to surround Ayram. They kept their shields up, kept their footwork clean, kept their spears steady under their arms - then Ayram swung his spud bar in a swooping arc, and all discipline went to . The iron bar crunched through the shield arm of one Hrk, and then the chisel-head sliced through the face of another. The rest of the hapless soldiers charged and stabbed, but such was Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s speed that he spun his bar around in time to splinter the shafts of their spears. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Each soldier in turn jumped back to avoid the . One of them picked up a rock and threw it at Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head, and before Mandri could see how Ayram dealt with it, he felt a sharp prodding in his back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get a move on!\u8221\'94 The soldier behind him shouted. The man was evidently unconcerned that his comrades had just suffered terribly. He was more interested in getting Mandri to the Hrkan line. So impatient was he, that he took Mandri by the wrist, upped the pace to a jog, yanking a distracted Mandri along behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When they got to the Hrkan detachment, the soldier threw Mandri down into the sand, then set the cold edge of his blade on the back of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck to keep his head bowed in obeisance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier then pounded his chest twice - the standard Hrkan salute - and then he said, in bark of a well-drilled soldier, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My lord Mayzdariga, I\u8217\'92ve found another skulking bandit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri dared to look up. Standing before him was a child robed in black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo had said that the Mazydariga were child-like, but this was a literal child, a brown-skinned Jandri boy no more than five years old. So short was he, that Mandri, kneeling, could meet him eye to eye. And Obo had said they were twisted creatures, but this child looked tortured, not twisted. In the place of a nose the child wore a flat metallic device in the shape of a nose, and that was riveted onto a leather band, and that was strapped on round the head. The child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes were so bloodshot that the edges seemed on the cusp of bleeding. Even so they were still filled with a childlike curiosity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Next this Mazydariga child was a bald, pudgy . Unlike the other Hrkans, this man wore the garb of a venal palace scribe - a pale blue robe with long, baggy sleeves, and a . He had a soft, chubby look about him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This scribe looked down at Mandri, and with plain derision in his voice, he said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Another coward lurking in the rubble.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then the Mazydariga spoke, if coming a little sluggish from the throat bothered by phlegm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He smells like a Mazydai.\u8221\'94 There was no hint of menace in the child\u8217\'92s words, this was merely a statement of fact. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 the scribe said thoughtfully, before turning to address to soldier who\u8217\'92d captured Mandri. \u8220\'93The Lord told you to fetch the Mazyd\u8217\'92s body, not fetch a sniveling rat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes sir. Yes, my lord.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier saluted again, then ran back towards the corpse of Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As the soldier fluttered away, Mandri found the courage to speak, now that his neck was free from a threatening blade. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My lord, thank you for rescuing me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Mazyadriga child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes went wide in surprise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was a prisoner of these bandits. I\u8217\'92m not with these people, I was captured.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The child looked up at his scribe. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My lord, he is lying to you,\u8221\'94 the scribe said to his little master. \u8220\'93This one is a ruffian, just like the rest of them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is he?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is, my lord. We shall keep him with the other one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribe nodded to a nearby soldier, and the soldier marched over, dragged Mandri to his feet, and led him over to where one of the Ayramun, Seb, was kneeling, hands bound behind his back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was about to kneel beside him, when suddenly, a horn sounded and the whole Hrkan line saluted. The Horn sounded again and the marched towards minting rock. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 By the time they got to the whole bloody scene was laid bare. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Bodies, mostly Hrkan, literred amongst the rubble. Interspersed throughout the rubble were hints of crushed Ayramun; a limp hand sticking from a, shreds of robes and literring the rubble. Everywhere there dried up bodies like the ones in the tomb that Mandri had. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  The only people alive were Ayramun. There weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t many of them. They huddled together in the middle of the arena. Moto, Elrahet, Purl, , and of course, Ayram. They watched the untroubled Hrkans stroll into arena. A Hrkan commander gave a shout, and the so}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribed stepped forth to address the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The battle is over. Lay down your or arms.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Actual expectation this would be done.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Since you have proved yourselves to be ruffians outside the natural laws which governs man, you will be dealt according to the law of beasts, and so you shall be sold in the court of Hababeen, the governor of Eez. If you persist in your barbarity, we shall undress your weight with a dull blade, and feed your trimmings to the pigs.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram makes no motion to surrender.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Regent motions for prisoners brought in.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Toss your weapons on the ground, or you will all be slaughtered, beginning with this skulking coward.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No more lives need be lost here today. Toss your weapons. The light of the law demands it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do what you need do. Or, leave.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Leave? That is impossible. You have consorted with a traitorous Mazyd lord. It is our duty, as faithful Hrks in the service of Solraheen, to see proper justice meted out, whether we lay down our lives to do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A few grumbles amongst the hrks, significantly less convinced of the long arm of justice.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Smacks on the back of leg, bows out of the way.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Kid whispers something.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The lord Mazydriga wishes to know, for what purpose did the traitor MazydObo recruit you into his service?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nonsense. How could a troop of thugs capture the power of a full blooded Mazyd?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93From what I understand, there was an ambush.\u8221\'94}
