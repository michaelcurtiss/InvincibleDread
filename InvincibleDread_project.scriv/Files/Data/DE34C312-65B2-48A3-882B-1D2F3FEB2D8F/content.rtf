He was buried under the earth. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d walked the world for one million years, protected it from harm, but entombed he could do nothing as the Sandrijin\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Great Drought\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 ravaged the world above. The Sandrijin lasted one hundred years. It killed thousands. It transformed the Sand into what it is. Yet among all it\u8217\'92s ravages, the one which effectively destroyed the Old Jandri world was the drying up of the Ukut river. With the river gone, the tribe called the Gairo could no longer sustain themselves on the Ukut plateau, and so they swept down into the Sand\u8217\'92s Middle Portion. But it was not the Gairo who mattered, it was the people whom they butchered and displaced\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the Hrks. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Hrks wandered the Sand for one thousand years until, at last, Arnaggu led his people out of their suffering and into the Fertile Portion. Little in the way of art or architecture survived their barbarian charm. Every shrine and temple had their arches broken and their eternal flames snuffed out. It is said that the only thing that truly survived in tact was belief in Solraheen, for the Hrks could not deny what they could see with their own eyes, buried there under the crater at the mouth of the river Jek. The Hrks claimed that holy crater as theirs, built their city, Jeket, inside of it, and from there, they conquered the world.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They were not the first to conquer the world. It had been done at least once before, back when Solraheen walked the earth. An Old Jandri king named Dror held dominion over all of Jandri. To prove it, he placed interlocking blocks of granite two-by-two-by-ten at every bend of every river. Out of these grey columns he carved his long-bearded, tall-robed image, and though some them survived the Hrks, none of survived unscathed. The statue in the best condition was first one to be built, built at the Jek\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s source overlooking the Shoglok falls. It stands there above the crashing water and rising mist looking like a wraith, for it is sanded so smooth by erosion that no discernible feature of Dror remains. He is little more than a grey wither in the general shape of a man, doing nothing but watching the sun rise and fall.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The river descends down into the foothills where it is guarded by a spate of Drors that have been sanded into smooth, pointed pillars, more like cattle scratch posts than a filigreed statue of a king, their heads reduced to conical nubs, their swords worn down to the hilt. The river then pours out of the foothills and down into the brink of Hrkan civilization, where the Drors are somewhat shielded from the wind but were not able to hide from the chisels of recriminate outland men. Further down the river and into on the long and winding plain, Dror\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s component parts begin to disappear altogether, for the stones are handy materials in the building of pastoral walls. By the time one reaches the most distant city-spawn of Jeket, all that is left of Dror\u8217\'92s monuments are the enormous plinths upon which they once stood. These foundation stones were too large to handle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Old Jandri statues are disintegrating the nearer they come to Jeket\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there is imagery here, and it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s unsubtle and pointed, and so of course people disagree about what it means. A Hrkan Lord would say that it is a sign of Hrk\u8217\'92s cleansing influence on the old world, while an outlander thinks its a sign of Hrk\u8217\'92s corrupting influence. They long for that earlier age when people were rootless, when herds of oxen were free to be chased across the continent, when women wove blankets so long they could be wrapped around a village, and when men were honest and would cut off their own fingers just to prove that they were sorry. But all of that is gone. Solraheen walked the earth for one million years and yet nothing made in that age truly remains.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Somehow, this wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even close to being the stupidest argument that Mandri had ever heard regarding art interpretation. The worst was the argument surrounding the Stria which hangs in the entrance hall of the Temple Krait. This painting is large, two men tall and one wide, and in a technical sense the painting is a masterwork. The scene overflows with silk-satin of every color, and silk-satin is a challenging material to paint because it inevitably moves, the reflections change, and so most painters make use of mannequins and glue to keep the folds still, but Stria, inspired by Solraheen, could capture its likeness without reference. The actual subject is a white-robed man and a red-robed woman standing in a window-lit room. Their postures seem confused, their backs are turned to each-other, and both look over the shoulder at the other. Some say it depicts a man preserving his honor by refusing the temptations of the young beauty, while others say it is the woman who preserves her virtue by shunning the advances of a besotted man. This argument can stir up literal firestorms, yet the Temple Krait accommodates either interpretation, for the temple praises chastity above all other virtues, and surely that is the message, for the temple\u8217\'92s dome can be seen through the window.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But there\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a unsubtle signal taking place between the two subjects. She\u8217\'92s thrusting her thumb between two of her fingers, and he accepts by making a circle with this thumb and middle finger. It would seem, then, that the temple\u8217\'92s dome is no chastely crown, it is the watchful eye under which two lovers plan a tryst.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 That no one seemed to read it that way made Mandrameen insane. He once pointed the suggestive hands out to a mendicant, and he was told, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Young man, your mind is overwhelmed with lust.\u8221\'94 While that might have been true it didn\u8217\'92t matter\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Stria was clearly intending to make a mockery of all these prudes. And it was much the same with those crumbling statues of Dror\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the pivotal detail that no one seemed to notice was that half of those statues were sitting alone out in an empty desert because over the centuries, the river Jek has changed it\u8217\'92s course too many times to count. The lesson here is not that Old Jandri was better, or that Hrk should last forever, its that neither matters at all\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 creation\u8217\'92s only constant is that changes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If Mandri was sure of anything, he was sure of that. Nothing stays the same for long, and everything he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ever seen reinforced that presumption.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When Mandri stepped down into the tunnel that led under Minting Rock\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s belly, he bore no suspicions of the rock\u8217\'92s age. He supposed he was walking into an outland hovel like any other, and that the rock itself was only a surface marker. He ventured into that sunlit central well, he looked up to see a canted column of light shining down into Minting Rock\u8217\'92s interior and suddenly the pain in his demon-bitten leg was less severe. Strange how the sensation of awe can do that. With this shaft drilled right through it, it seemed as if Minting Rock were a cast-off bead from the necklace of some forgotten mountain god.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He grabbed the rope which hung down into the dark, and an out of sight an Ayramun began to pull him up. Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s feet left the floor, bounced off the stone wall, and soon after they kicked out into a void. Then someone lit a torch and space around him lit up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This first floor of Minting Rock was a shallow, bowl shaped room with Mandri hanging out in the middle of it like a uvula. The curved floor was carved to look like a liquid surface, with a tide of concentric rings rippling out into cresting waves in miniature, all of it polished to a sheen as smooth as a Hrkan Lord\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s table. Amidst this stone sea were four pillars holding up the perfectly level ceiling. These pillars were no ordinary pillars, not rectangular or columnar, because they hadn\u8217\'92t been carried there from somewhere else, they were carved out of the solid rock, stone demons, full and dynamic figures with backs bent against the low ceiling, each one scaled and snarling. Mandri might have thought them real if it weren\u8217\'92t for the Ayramun\u8217\'92s packs haphazardly scattered about between them. Hill was there too, torch in hand, rummaging about for something just out of sight. Despite the quality of the craftsmanship, which was unparalleled to anything Mandri had seen, the Ayramun were treating it as a storage space. Hill paid Mandri no mind as the hands above continued to pull him upwards.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The second level was a bulbous, cylindrical cocoon with a flat, featureless disc for a floor. It was much taller and larger than the room below, perhaps eight-men wide, but nowhere near the full thickness of the rock. Every inch of this room\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall was overlaid with several layers of sculptural stone worked into a weave that criss-crossed into each-other, giving the walls a sense of filigreed depth. Mandri was in awe. He\u8217\'92d never seen anything like it. Some genius had achieved such finesse with a hammer and chisel that they could carve away these overlapping layers into a stunning kaleidoscopic vision stolen from a burgeon binge. The topmost layer resembled a swirling fence of barbed chains, and like a climbing vine they spiraled all the way up the wall and converged towards the center of the ceiling, merging into the lashes of a large eye whose iris was the open shaft which led ever upwards and into the light of day.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was symbolism Mandri had never seen. Were the chains pulling the eye open? He had assumed that all Old Jandri symbols had been consumed by the current age, but this was otherworldly. There was a story written inside of Minting Rock that was lost to the wider world. The level of technique was lost as well. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He lamented the lack of light\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 two flower-flame oil lamps were not enough, and they weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t spread far enough apart for each fixed to either shoulder of a dark and narrow passage to Mandri\u8217\'92s left. Much of the room\u8217\'92s detail was lost to blackness, the intricate complexity was only suggested by dancing glint of bouncing off the polished sheen. So far as Mandri could see, it was all in perfect condition. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Unfortunately, it all smelled like Ayramun. Unwashed and foul, like a urinal. And just as Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s mood was beginning to change, an unseen hand grabbed a fistful of his robe in between the shoulder blades and yanked him off the rope and fully clear of the well-hole. He was then dropped on to the hard stone floor and the pain in his thigh reasserted itself.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man who\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d pulled him out was Seb. The stark contrast between Seb\u8217\'92s brown, dirty, tufty self and the polished interior was startling. He looked like one of Jeket\u8217\'92s crawlers\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a man who begs from beggars.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this place?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This be Minting Rock,\u8221\'94 Seb said as his gummy mouth squelched on a borcandi spine.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t care about the name,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93What }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  this place? What is it for? Who made it?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb nudged Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s hip with the toe of his shoe. He shooed Mandri up against the wall with a few flaps of his fingers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep out of the way,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri scuttled backwards, then shoved his injured leg flush against the sculptural wall so that nothing of him stuck out into the middle of the floor. It was then that he noticed that Obo was in the room with them. The Mazyd lay on the opposite side, still playing dead. Amusingly, Obo had one eye open, squinting out at the world, and when Mandri noticed, Obo winked. \line \tab Mandri shook his head and chuckled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Something funny?\u8221\'94, Seb asked. The man thought that Mandri was laughing at him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No,\u8221\'94 said Mandri. \u8220\'93Just can\u8217\'92t believe this is all happening to me. It\u8217\'92s all a bit ridiculous.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It ain\u8217\'92t ridiculous at all,\u8221\'94 said Seb. \u8220\'93You spend long enough with Ayram and you learn that ain\u8217\'92t nothin ridiculous.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, sure.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bet your leg hurts. What did it look like, the demon?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Actually, It looked a bit like those statues down below.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did it!?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was so startled by Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s response that the borcandi spine dropped out of his lip. He bent down, picked it up, stuffed it right back in.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I been out here thirty somethin\u8217\'92 years,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93an I never seen no demon like that. Nothin\u8217\'92 nearly like a man.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, I\u8217\'92ve seen two.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb raised a skeptical eye. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Two? When was the other?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93About the day before I died. There was this\u8230\'85woman. An old woman.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93An ole woman?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93She was a normal old woman until she\u8230\'85it\u8217\'92s like she sprouted fangs and she\u8230\'85I saw her eat an ox\u8217\'92s Spark.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As Mandri told the story he was remembering how hopped upon burgeon beer he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been when it all happened. He started to wonder if he\u8217\'92d hallucinated it. Something . Seb could hear it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You lie,\u8221\'94 Seb spat.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t think I am. I might be, but I don\u8217\'92t think so.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re a burgeon biter. I know em when I see em. I see demons too when I get popped up, but I don\u8217\'92t go around believin it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, but this one talked to me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Did she?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Said her name was Pell.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s borcandi spine fell out for a second time. This time, however, he let it sit. He was too busy}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where\u8217\'92d you here that name?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I just told you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Nuh-nuh-nuh-no. You didn\u8217\'92t hear that name, you hear me?"}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri is like, what. Seb Squats down. Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sun-leathered face. Hair bristling like. He lowered his voice to a near whisper.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Seein\u8217\'92 one demon is seein\u8217\'92 one demon\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s fine. Seein\u8217\'92 two is seein\u8217\'92 too many. It starts to look like it means somethin\u8217\'92, know what I mean?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t tell no one you saw some ole bitch demon named Pell. If anyone asks, the demon that bit you is the only demon you ever seen\u8230\'85You tell anyone sides me?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No\u8230\'85why?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What you think we do to demons, boy? What you think we do to folks that\u8217\'92s friendly with demons?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb seemed profoundly mystified by Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s apparent inability to grasp the obvious. Mandri smiled, and said coyly, \u8220\'93What do you do with them?\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb scrunched up his face at Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s sour words. \u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t care if you sleep with demons,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93You do what you do and that\u8217\'92s what you supposed to do, but I\u8217\'92m the only one in the whole wide world who thinks that way. Any one of these Ayramun find out that you\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94, Seb dropped his voice to whisper and leaned into his words. \u8220\'93Anyone finds out that you on a first name basis with a she-demon, they\u8217\'92ll kill you, an it won\u8217\'92t be no quick thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His tired eyes managed to impress upon Mandri some sense of the brutality of outland justice. Before Mandri could ask Seb why he wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t worried about someone cavorting with demons, a shrill whistle rang out from the oculus above. Seb stepped away, shook by the sound, and he wasn\u8217\'92t the only one it had startled\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Minting Rock was suddenly alive with Ayramun. Footfalls inside the walls above and behind, out of sight shouts of frustration, Hill came climbing up the well-shaft rope, and without so much as nod, kept climbing up and up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s going on?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep out of the way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There came a second whistle, this one more sharper, more urgent. Then there came a chink, chink, chink of metal on stone echoing out of the passage to Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s left, increasing in pitch as it neared the central chamber. Suddenly Ayram burst into the room, beard-jutting and wild-eyed, looking at Obo\u8217\'92s lifeless lump with hate. In his hand was a long staff of black-iron, two-heads taller than himself. One end of this bar was cast into a sphere the size of a fist, and the other, a spade-tipped chisel, which bit into the polished floor as Ayram marched towards Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto followed Ayram into the room, and waddling in behind him was the short old witch Elrahet. She lingered by the threshold, under the flickering lamps, and her dark hood cast a long, hard shadow which hid her face from view. Mandri watched her as she watched Ayram, he found some familiarity in her profile but couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t place it. She turned her head towards him, caught him staring, and he quickly looked away. It was only a glancing exchange, and he hadn\u8217\'92t seen her eyes for the shadow, yet it was enough to stir his stomach. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Both Ayram and Moto stood over Obo, dwarfing the already quartered Mazyd, who lay helpless, feigning unconsciousness. Moto kicked him hard in the ribs, and when Obo didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t move, Moto steadied himself against the wall and was about to deliver another kick when Elrahet told him to stop.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s already awake,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Indeed, his eyes were open, squinting, looking around as if waking up from a deep dream. The opulence of surrounding appeared to surprise him. If Mandri didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t know better, he would have believed that Obo was genuinely confused.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me how you did it,\u8221\'94 Ayram growled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo made to speak, then stopped to swallow as if his throat needed lubrication. He coughed. He asked hoarse voice, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m sorry? I did what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How did they find us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who is \u8216\'91they\u8217\'92?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There is a column of Hrkan Skelsi marching this way.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see,\u8221\'94 said Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do they know we\u8217\'92re here,\u8221\'94 said Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The answer to a question like that depends on where you decide to draw the line between cause and effect, doesn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram let his iron spud-bar slip down his fist so that the chisel end hit the stone floor right next to Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s . Obo sighed and said, \u8220\'93I only bring attention to the  of causality because you\u8217\'92re so quick to blame me when most reasonable people would say that I didn\u8217\'92t do anything at all. }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 You\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92re}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  the one that brought me here, so if we\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re assigning blame the fingers should be pointing at you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With a twist of his wrist, Ayram set the iron chisel to rest against Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s collar bone. \u8220\'93How did they find us,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I see your point,\u8221\'94 said Obo. \u8220\'93Unfortunately for both us, it seems you are unaware that the Hrkan Lords not so stupid as to make a weapon like me without devising a way to track me down should I get loose.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto interrupted. Dead seriousness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How do they do it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Have you truly never heard of the Mazydariga?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Two men unwilling to admit ignorance. Mandri had never heard of it either.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet leans on her staff, and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is a Mazydariga?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a Mazyd\u8217\'92s shadow.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I understand the word. What is it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Beyond the name, I don\u8217\'92t know much about it. I\u8217\'92ve never seen it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri is like, uh, this dude is fucked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It doesn\u8217\'92t matter, we can take them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s seventy-five men,\u8221\'94 Elrahet said harshly, cutting down Moto\u8217\'92s optimism.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I may ask,\u8221\'94 said Obo, \u8220\'93what is it you plan to do with me? I might even be sympathetic to your cause.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram lifted the spud-bar from Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s chest. \u8220\'93If we die here,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93you shall die with us.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I could easily kill them, and then none of us would die. Just tell me what you plan to do with me, and we might come to some arrangement\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 \u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Moto.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Go up and get them fit and ready.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Moto nodded and jumped onto the well-shaft rope and climbed out of sight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram turned to Seb, eyes afire.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes?\u8221\'94 Seb asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Take the boy and the Mazyd up into a haspex.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb pounded his heart and bowed deeply as Ayram and Elrahet swept out of the chamber and back into the passage from whence they came. Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s iron staff clink, clinked as he went, and soon the sound was lost in the den of a small tribe rushing to and fro preparing for battle.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb grabbed Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wrist and helped him up, then he went over to Obo and made a fuss about wrapping up Obo\u8217\'92s wounds so that Mazyd blood wouldn\u8217\'92t taint his person. Once Obo was swaddled up tight in his own ragged robe, Seb picked him up and and carried him under his arm into the dark passage. He disappeared, then popped back out and motioned for Mandri to follow.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t able to keep up. He followed Seb through a narrow hall, limping fiercely, steadying himself against the sculptured stone. Eventually the patter of Seb\u8217\'92s rushing feet got lost amidst the rest of the shuffling sounds echoing through these narrow corridors. Then Seb somehow appeared behind him and smacked his back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said hurry up!\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Now Seb walked with his free-hand clutching Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s right wrist, and he pulled Mandri Seb towards a sputtering lamp which illuminated a chubby set of curling stairs. After ascending these, it quickly became difficult for Mandri to maintain a sense of where he was within the of the rock. There was little light, and he was shoved through so many dark and twisting passages that all he knew for sure was that he was moving away from the center. Each chamber and every corridor became more cluttered and cramped, and the stonework less polished and more rough\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the walls were still carved into a layered weave but Mandri\u8217\'92s fingers could feel the inattention to thickness and edge, it was a childish imitation of what Mandri had seen in that central well-shaft chamber. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri got to thinking, after bumping his head on an absurdly low-ceiling, that whoever had carved out this rock had carved out too much of it. From the outside, Minting Rock already looked unstable, like a god-sized liggu nut standing tip-toe on it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stubby stem. From the inside, that feeling of being precariously balanced was magnified, and unless Old Jandri tribesmen were as learned as a royal Hrkan architect, the whole thing was bound to fall apart. The further out Mandri went, the more slapdash the passages and rooms became, and the more Mandri became convinced that Minting Rock\u8217\'92s organs were being held together by magic. By the time they reached the outer section of rock, where blue sky could be seen through slits and watchholes, Mandri\u8217\'92s toes and fingers would stumble upon stress cracks in the floors and walls. Once, in this dusty dark, he bumped shoulders with an unworked wooden beam that arched up and over his head to keep the floor above from caving in. The fact that it was all still standing seemed a miracle. Eventually, he was pushed into a long and narrow room, more than long enough for him to lay down in, but barely enough room to turn around.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Thankfully, this room had access to natural light through a stippled pattern of finger-sized holes bored into the far wall. The sun didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t shine directly through them, so these pinpricks of day sat on the wall illuminating nothing, like a constellation of stars composing an Old Jandri pattern\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a circle of diamonds radiating out from a central sunflame circle. It was the traditional symbol of Solraheen, before the Hrks built Jeket on top of him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb elbowed Mandri into this narrow closet, and that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s when the room\u8217\'92s defining quality hit him\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the air was thick with a foul incense, sweet and horrible, cloying, like a mound of peaches left to putrefy in a muggy spring sun. Mandri gagged, clutched at his nose, and when a spicy bitterness stung his tongue like rancid burgeon bile he spat and choked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He thought, at first, that this was some kind of prayer room and that the smell was put here to trigger his spiritual impulse, because that\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s what prayer room incense was supposed to do. He didn\u8217\'92t entertain the thought that this scent was meant to mask a fouler smell until he reached out in the dark to steady himself against the shoulder-squeezing wall, and instead of slapping against rock, his fingers sank into something that felt curiously like skin. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He yelped and recoiled. A shock of fright ran through him as he bounced into the opposite wall where his other hand gripped a dried and bony wrist. He yelped again, and prayed fast that Solraheen would adjust his eyes to the dimness. All he could see were a series of long, dark recesses cut into the dark rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb slapped the back of his head. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Keep your hands to yourself.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What\u8217\'92s in there?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t worry it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb pushed Mandri towards the stipple-pricked sigil of Solraheen. Mandri reached out and caught himself against this blessed wall, and then he sniffed the air. Now that his nose was curious it found out the tang of rotting flesh being smothered by all that incense smoke.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He turned to protest his new accommodation.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sit down and be quiet,\u8221\'94 Seb commanded.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Suddenly, something crashed into Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stomach. He wheezed and went sprawling against the wall and sank down to floor, and as he fumbled around in the dark he squealed in disgust when his thumb poked through a stiff and gristled cloth and into something constistency of crusty, curdled jelly. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A light and airy voice laughed, Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s, for it was his stumped thigh into which Mandri had plumbed his thumb. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get off me!\u8221\'94 Mandri squealed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I hardly can. I\u8217\'92m wrapped up tight as a babe.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb quelled the commotion with a furious whisper.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You two quit rumblin! This is a sacred place. An don\u8217\'92t touch anythin.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri picked Obo up, and not only was he swaddled like a babe, he was light as one too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Stop wriggling.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Put me down.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no where to put you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said quit rumblinnnnn!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice sank through the \u8220\'93rumblinnn\u8221\'94, descending into a feral growl. Mandi didn\u8217\'92t want to get slapped so he shut up and stuffed Obo in between his right leg and the wall. He was having a hard time of it when the diffuse orange glow of lamplight crept up the corridor wall behind Seb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb spun around and there was the girl Purl, the girl who couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t get Obo to kneel back in that pit cave. She held a shallow clay oil lamp in her right hand, and with her left arm, her handless arm, she clutched a number of jars close to her chest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She stopped at the rooms entrance. She peered around Seb at Mandri, as if looking for him. The warm lamplight hitting the red kell oil smeared on her skin made her look like she\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d just come from a pit of slaughter. She looked tired enough for it\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 half-lidded eyes, gaunt, expressionless, with long, bedraggled hair sprouting out of a wide black bandanna just to get it all out of the way.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Move,\u8221\'94 she said to Seb. Seb begrudgingly stepped out of the room to give her the space to enter. As she did, her lamplight splayed out on the room\u8217\'92s interior, bringing this haunting \u8216\'91closet\u8217\'92 to life.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Cut into the black rock walls were coffin-sized slits, three on either side, stacked one above the other. Inside each of these, resting in a peaceful repose, was a corpse, each in a different stage of decomposition, and each naked as come from the womb, and all of them, as far as Mandri could tell, were giant men\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 Ayram-sized men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The corpse the light lit clearest was as dry and shriveled as a grape weeks fallen from the vine. It was impossible to say for certain how long that body had been laying there, for an unbothered corpse in the Sand could last an age, but cloistered away in Minting Rock, sheltered from the wind and abrasion, Mandri figured that a corpse could last for as long as Solraheen willed it. That body could be as ancient as the world itself\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85but ancient corpses don\u8217\'92t smell, at least Mandrameen didn\u8217\'92t think they did, so at least one of these graves had to be recently inhumed. Probably, it was the first one he\u8217\'92d touched\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 middle hole on the right hand wall. From what he could see it didn\u8217\'92t seem particularly fresh, though from his position on the floor he could only see pieces\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 a dessicated hand with purple-black fingers, a plaited braid of jet-black hair, mostly he saw shadows and vignettes of dry, skin-wrapped bones coated in a layer of dust. There was no hint of bloat, no tar-like iridescence of fresh rot that might explain the smell.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then Mandri looked down and saw the spreading rot in his  own leg and he wondered if the smell was coming from him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl set her lamp down in a shallow recess carved for the purpose, waist-high, into the left-hand wall. Then she knelt and placed some her things onto the floor\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 first, a thick square of grey wool folded tight into itself, then a bundle of damp leaves knotted at the stems, and last a stone mortar which tinked against the floor. The only things left nestled in her arm were three small alabastron jars that were packed to the brim with waxy substances, one yellow, one red, and one white. Purl hesitated with these, clearly unused to having only one hand, so Mandri leaned forward and reached out to help. He grabbed two of the jars and set them down. Purl grabbed the other. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let me see the bite,\u8221\'94 she said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri leaned onto his right ass cheek and rolled his wound into the light. Purl eyed the festering flesh with a keen interest.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Would you look at that,\u8221\'94 she muttered.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb was now standing behind her, hovering over her shoulder, slopping on a fresh borcandi spine right in her ear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re blocking the light,\u8221\'94 Purl snipped.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb moved back, then cleared his phlegmy throat and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t do anything yet.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Why not? This needs to be dressed.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I want to question him first.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You two can talk while I\u8217\'92m working.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl pulled a thumb-sized pestle from her ruddy robes and she dolloped a two-finger-dip of each of the three waxes into her mortar. Her movements were awkward for her one good hand wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t used to doing two things at once, so each jar rolled around, and each time she had to catch it.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I said stop,\u8221\'94 Seb pecked. \u8220\'93Only fix him up if he talks.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl sat back in the folds of her robe and sighed. She turned, looked at Seb as if he were a gadfly. She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can torture him later.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not torture to let things be.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl turned back to her work. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We don\u8217\'92t have time for this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb looked to Mandri to make sure that Mandri was getting the measure of his words. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Tell me what you were doing in the Junei hills, and Purl will heal your wound.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl clicked her teeth. Shut Seb up. She plucked some of the leaves into the mortar, spit into it, then got to smashing that waxy substance into a paste.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo peered into it.\line \tab Purl stopped her grinding. Seb raised his brow in surprise. Mandri turned to look at his wretch of a friend, who was smushed up in between his shoulder and the wall, looking upset. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t mind me,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m just a curious observer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She then continued on to smash the the leaves down into the wax, the rhythmic knead of her pestle pulping the mixture into a syrupy goo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m apologize if any harm came to you on my account.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Though I won\u8217\'92t apologize for fighting in self defense.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You killed forty-somethin Ayramun.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You can hardly blame me for killing your kin when they were lobbing arrows at my throat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb unsheathed a long knife which he kept hidden underneath his robe. The sudden appearance of menacing blade startled Mandri, but Obo was unconcerned, even though the blade\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s point was threatening his nose.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You killed good people in those hills,\u8221\'94 Seb said.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl stopped kneading. Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes lit aflame and he squeezed his knife\u8217\'92s hilt tight. \u8220\'93I wonder,\u8221\'94 he said, \u8220\'93if I cut off your tongue, would shit still come spewing?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl was the one who laughed.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s Sparkless, Seb. Might as well get mad at a rock.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, you should save your energy for what\u8217\'92s coming.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 She said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The only way we\u8217\'92d ever treat with you, Mazyd, is if you showed the slightest scrap of humanity now and then.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You want to me to slaughter seventy men, just to save your skin.

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Without missing a beat, and with all the certainty of a child praying to Sol, Purl said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, you are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo laughed, but Purl brushed away his disbelief with a snort, then said \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t pretend like those Skelsi marching this way aren\u8217\'92t bloodthirsty, raping, brutes.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92re nothing like them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ah, forgive me, then. You are kind, caring folk who didn\u8217\'92t chop off my legs. It must be that I have misplaced them. Seb, if you could go and take a look, they should be laying around somewhere outside.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb lowered the tip of his sword towards Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cheek and said, \u8220\'93What Ayram did to you is a scratch compared to what you deserve.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl nodded in agreement. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You Mazydai have killed more innocents than drought\u8230\'85 disease\u8230\'85\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl shook her head as she slapped the gooey poultice onto Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wound. \u8220\'93You won\u8217\'92t pull me into the mud,\u8221\'94 she said. \u8220\'93I know what you are.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Outside of trying to bend me to your will, you\u8217\'92ve never once spoken to me, not until now. In fact, not a single one of you Ayramun had ever spoken to a Mazyd before three days ago. The truth is that I have more virtues than you can count. Certainly more than Seb can count. Can you count, Seb? Count to ten for me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s rage was close to boiling over. \u8220\'93Where I\u8217\'92m from you\u8217\'92d be killed twice over already.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where I come from, a man who uses violence to deal with an uncomfortable truth is called a brute.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, shut up,\u8221\'94 said Purl.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you, my dear, are a brute as well. A fine figured brute, but a brute nonetheless.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb flicked his wrist and sliced Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s cheek. It was only skin deep, but it was enough to draw a trickle of blood streaming down Obo\u8217\'92s jaw.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Bloodthirsty brutes,\u8221\'94 Obo said. \u8220\'93And what was that last indictment of yours, Purl? Raping? You could rape me, Seb, but I don\u8217\'92t think you\u8217\'92ll find my lower half in any condition to ravage. It\u8217\'92s a good thing you\u8217\'92ve kept my tongue intact because you\u8217\'92ll have to settle for -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb made to cut Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s words short with his blade, but Purl leapt up and pinned Seb\u8217\'92s wrist to the wall. \u8220\'93Get OUT!,\u8221\'94 she yelled.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb grunted, sheathed his knife, then stormed out of the narrow tomb.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wake left a void of purpose in the air, and Mandrameen seized the moment by inserting himself into the conversation with all the bluster and arrogance of a churchmouse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If I could get in a word on my own behalf,\u8221\'94 he squeaked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl glared at him. The fact that no one stopped him let Mandri know he should continue.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m more than willing to answer anything you want to know about me,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s just, I don\u8217\'92t have anything particularly interesting to say. Like, you people think I\u8217\'92m some kind of living curse but I\u8217\'92m not, I\u8217\'92m just a hapless young man whose fallen on hard times.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl crossed her arms and asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you have nothing to hide, why didn\u8217\'92t you cooperate with Moto?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was. Moto lied to you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then why did you jump into a lizard pit?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t. He threw me in. Moto is a god-damned liar.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Lock eyes with purl. Stuck in. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He also said you killed yourself\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 that\u8217\'92s why we found you dead out in the Junei plain. Is that true?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I didn\u8217\'92t kill myself. I was stabbed in the chest by this crazy guy in Meskalim.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If you were killed in Meskalim, then how did your body end up all the way out in the Junei?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Presumably, it was carried.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Who was it that killed you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Salavan Saran.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Salavan? The governor of Meskalim?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The same,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93He is an eccentric one. Three beans short of a full pod. He was raving about some kind of prophecy involving a painter and some god I\u8217\'92d never heard of. I\u8217\'92m a painter, you know, I mostly do portraits, and\u8230\'85well, that doesn\u8217\'92t matter. I guess he thought I might be the one to fulfill this old prophecy.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This prophecy involved killing you?\u8221\'94 she asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I guess.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl paused to consider Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s story. At first, she seemed confused, like there wasn\u8217\'92t a word straight. Then Mandri saw a glint in her eye and her whole countenance shifted to }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Which god did you say it was?\u8221\'94 Purl asked.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Which god was the prophecy about?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri remembering the story was a little dark. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t remember,\u8221\'94 Mandri said. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not a prophecy I\u8217\'92d ever heard of. I think it might have had to do with Schisol, but Salavan had a different name for him.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mid?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah, that was it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face went blank and}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Holy shit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Look to eachother. Eyebrows raised.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl asked, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93You said you\u8217\'92re a painter?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah. Well, I was, I\u8217\'92m not anymore though. I\u8217\'92m a farmer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before he could finish his sentence, Purl had already swiveled on one foot and rushed out of the room.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri looks to Mazyd Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo chuckled and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That went poorly for you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What did I say?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I told you they were superstitious folk. You\u8217\'92ve just spooked that girl.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Clearly.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mazyd Obo pulled himself out of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s corner and stretched himself along the floor, now that there were fewer bodies in the room. All the way to the entrance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I can hear Purl talking with Seb right now. Want to know what they\u8217\'92re saying?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo crooked his ear towards the entrance. Mandri tried to pick Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s voice from out amongst the whispering echoes and the sound of pattering feet of that carried through Minting Rock\u8217\'92s tunnelwork.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Purl mentions something called the Midden Rite\u8230\'85 Has to do with Mid, and that prophecy you were talking about. They fear this Mid\u8230\'85 That\u8217\'92s putting it lightly\u8230\'85 Ooof, Seb wants to cut off your head... While Purl\u8230\'85 Purl thinks Ayram should know about you first... Seb\u8217\'92s being stubborn about it\u8230\'85 And, aha! This is great. Seb says that if you truly are some prophesied soul, then killing you won\u8217\'92t solve anything because you\u8217\'92ll just find a way to come back. Now that\u8217\'92s the kind of childlike logic you love to hear from the outland folk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s exactly what Salavan said when he killed me.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93And you know what, here you are, alive.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe I am,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Here I was thinking Schisol never existed.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The Mazydai have searched for evidence of Schisol\u8217\'92s existence, and we haven\u8217\'92t found a shred. Solraheen is real enough. I should add that, even if Schisol, or Mid, isn\u8217\'92t real, the fear of him is. You should be careful mentioning one of those names around these Ayramun. I suspect that they\u8217\'92re some blood cult of Solraheen that I\u8217\'92ve never heard of.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think it\u8217\'92s a little late for not mentioning Schisol.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, but you were truthful, and that counts for something with these people\u8230\'85 I suspect it has Purl convinced that you were an unwitting participant in whatever happened to you in Meskalim.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri sighed. He peeked under the poultice on his leg and was surprised to see that the black rot was already receding. He said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93At least Purl seems like a normal human being.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo propped himself up on an elbow and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is a \u8216\'91normal human being\u8217\'92, Mandri?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo propped himself up on both elbows and pulled his robe open to reveal the scar running down his sternum. He pointed at it and said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think it was Purl who cut me open. Then she cut off her hand and buried it in my chest. As we speak, her fingers are gripping my heart. She means to make me her slave.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s a hand in your chest?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not any old hand. It is Purl\u8217\'92s hand.

I\u8217\'92ve only had one other Minder\u8217\'92s will suffusing my veins, but I can tell you, the difference between him and Purl is startling.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen stood up and looked through one of the small holes in the wall behind him. It was hard to see much because the rock was thick, limiting the field of view. A Hrkan column.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Mandri, it\u8217\'92s not healthy to abuse language like that. I thought you understood that my expectations for desert folk are so low that \u8216\'91goodness\u8217\'92 is euphemism for a baseline degree of decency.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93So, what, he\u8217\'92s got magic?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo looks through the hole. Perfect discipline. Mandri doubted there were enough murder holes to make this defense work. Trickle of fear.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That was two hands ago, Obo. People change.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Okay. Okay. You\u8217\'92re right. Let\u8217\'92s encourage each other. What should I say? I love you Obo, and I can\u8217\'92t wait to get slapped in the face with a sword right next to your skewered corpse. I can\u8217\'92t wait to set foot in the come-hereafter. Now, I know you haven\u8217\'92t got a Spark, so you won\u8217\'92t be there, but that\u8217\'92s just, well, that just makes this short time together so much sweeter, doesn\u8217\'92t it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It really does.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, it doesn\u8217\'92t.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Suddenly, a whistle, shrill and piercing, rang out from the Hrkan column. It was not a sound that Mandri had ever heard. It was metallic, tinny and it quivered like a strandtail\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s warble. It was ten times louder than any three-fingered shepherd\u8217\'92s whistle. It was sharper than the shriek of hunting hawk. The sound cut through the rock so clearly that it\u8217\'92s source might as well have been in the room. It was a pain between Mandri\u8217\'92s ears, but it was doing something stranger to Obo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo was collapsed on the floor. His eyes were rolling around in their sockets, twitching and turning as if there was something inside his skull stabbing at his ocular nerve. The whistling jumped to a higher pitch, and Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whole body began to convulse. Mandri reached out to keep Obo\u8217\'92s head from thumping against the stone, but before he could do anything, Obo\u8217\'92s stomach wretched, his chest heaved, and a dim, blue, formless ember shot out from his mouth, leaving his body limp and lifeless. The strange light hovered just above Obo\u8217\'92s lips for the briefest spell, then the whistling shifted its register again, higher still into a sound reserved for , and the blue ember shot right towards Mandrameen\u8217\'92s head.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri ducked out of the way and the ember whizzed past his neck, its energy scorching his skin as it went. It continued on to punch a hole the size of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s fist into the rock behind him, and Mandri spun around just in time to watch it zip out into the sky. He lost sight of it for a moment against the deep blue, then found it again as it dove towards the distant Hrkan column. As it fell, the whistling fell to a drowning timbre, until, with a flash, the light and the whistling were snuffed out altogether, as if swallowed up by that short black form that Obo had called the Mazydariga.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s ears could recover their tuning, the Hrkan horn of war sounded again.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 BWWWAAAAAAAWWWWW-oooooooo.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The deep bellow shook Mandri out of his skin. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d heard the horn before in Jeketian parades meant to announce the power of the Hrkan Lords, but this time, this time the horn was meant for him. Terror welled up in his gut.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He could see the Hrkan column so clearly now. It was flattening out to a square, and as soon as that square was made solid, a command was barked, and the soldiers began their advance, bracing their white, oblong shields up against the rain of arrows that was sure to come.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Twenty paces later, and the arrows flew out from Minting Rock. It felt to Mandri like the rock had come alive, like he was inside the stomach of a lumbering ridgeback lizard shooting it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s quills at an onrushing Hrkan snake, and while most of the arrows bounced harmlessly off the Hrkan hide, some snuck in between the scales, wounding the creature, marked here and there by the sudden tumbling of one of the Hrkan number and the triumphant whoops and yips of the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 These little victories did nothing to slow the Hrkan advance. Every gap opened by the death of one soldier was closed in rhythmic time. Left, right, left, reform. Left, right, left, reform. No stumbling. No gap between the lines was permitted to for long.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Inside of Minting Rock there was a flurry of activity. Mandri could hear the Ayramun sprinting from room to room, trying to find a better angled hole to fire upon their target. Some who scampered by Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burial chamber were ferrying bundles of arrows from one shooting nest to another.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb rushed by, then stumbled backwards, noticing the new hole in Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s wall.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Move out of the way!\u8221\'94 he shouted, and ran in, kicking Obo\u8217\'92s lifeless body to the side, then squatted down and started firing arrows down at the marching men.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A gleam in Seb\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eye, total fixation on the task, gleam when the, }
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Not being able to see what was going turned Mandri into an anxious wreck. He knew the Hrkans would be at the rock soon, but what they would do, how many the Ayramun would kill, how . Then Mandri heard a noise which}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink-TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What was that?\u8221\'94 Seb wondered aloud.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sounds like a fucking chisel,\u8221\'94 Mandri said.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink-TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seb turned around, eyes wide in alarm. Then he shoved Mandri aside and leapt back into the tunnels. Mandri made to follow, but Seb stopped him with a shove on the shoulder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri began to argue, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93If there\u8217\'92s a way out-\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shut up and stay put!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Reluctantly, Mandri scurried back to the hole in the wall and tried his best to make sense of the situation. Directly below was a bevy of upturned shields, in the center of each, the gold-eyed Hrkan sun, looking up at him with dumb indifference.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 DINK-DINK-DINK}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The chiseling was getting louder, faster. Then, echoing up the tunnels, the first roars men possessed by the spirit of battle. Somewhere far below, in that entrance well, limbs were getting hacked to pieces.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then came a loud crack\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 the snap of sandstone snapping. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CRACKKKKkkkk-kkk-kkkkkk-k.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The whole of Minting Rock lurched. Mandri stumbled, felt the rumble of the structure beginning to collapse under his feet. The sound of crunching rock echoed round like the peal of distant thunder.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then all went silent.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 No shouts of struggle. No chiseling. No clash of sword on shield. Even the sandfleas gnawing on loose grain stopped and swirled their antennae, sensing an ominous in the air.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 CHINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A long, jagged crack exploded into the floor of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s burial chamber. Minting Rock lurched again, and the dust of ages shook loose from the ceiling, as if the room above had been hammered by Solraeen\u8217\'92s fist.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Obo!\u8221\'94 Mandri shouted. \u8220\'93Obo, wake the fuck up!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With a jolt, the crack in the floor opened wider, then a thunderous boom sent the crack darting across the length of the room, fracturing the chamber in two. A eyeblink later and the chamber\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s whole left side slid down an inch before coming to a rest on some new foundation of rubble far, far below.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri, fear pulsing in chest, yanked one of the aged corpses out its resting place and tossed it onto the ground. He then grabbed Obo\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s arm and threw him into the now unoccupied grave. He pushed the Obo as far towards the back as he could, stuffing his noodle-like arms under his body, then Mandri crawled in alongside him. The very moment that Mandri tucked in his legs, the ceiling started to collapse.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first thing to go was Purl\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s clay oil lamp. It jostled loose from its ceiling hook and smashed onto the floor, splashing licks of oil and flame about the room. Then the walls shook, and the seams in the ceiling burst, shooting a jet of smoke into the room, flooding Mandri\u8217\'92s grave, obscuring the air so completely that Mandri couldn\u8217\'92t see the hail of stone crashing down. What he did see, after wiping the dust from his eyes, was the awesome sight of Minting Rock split in half like a geode.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Before his shock could even register, the opposite half began to fall away. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Haunting screams split the air as those Ayramun stuck on the wrong side of Minting Rock grasped their impending doom. Almost directly across from where Mandri stood, a ragged, fear-stricken man straddled the half-shorn wall of what once was a tunnel. Mandri watched in terror as the man rode the undone structure down into a billowing cloud of dust, crying prayers up to Solraheen as he went.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri closed his eyes.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There was a deafening crash, and the air came alive with the tinny screech of stone sliding against stone.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Lord, our Lord,\u8221\'94 Mandri prayed, \u8220\'93 \u8220\'93.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri opened his eyes again. He peered down at the chaos from his blessed perch. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t much through the swirling rust-colored smoke down below.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A swarm of white Hrkan cloaks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A sprinkling of black Ayramun rags.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They were moving.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 A yell rang out and the two splotches of color rushed each other. Once again, the battle was joined.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stumbled back from his ledge\hich\f0 \emdash \loch\f0 there was no clear way to get down. He thought, for a moment, that perhaps it was best to be stuck up in this high hole. No matter who won, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d be safe. He sat down, put his back against what was left of the wall, tucked his knees tight against his chest, and tried to cut, when heard the familiar sound.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink-TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Chink-TINK.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This time Mandri could feel the chisel strokes resonate through the rock. He buried his head in between his knees, covered it with his arms, and tried pretend that none of this was happening. While he could effectively shut out the sights and sounds, his sense of equilibrium remained, and it screamed bloody murder as his half of Minting Rock began to tilt.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At first it was only a slight shifting as the rock swayed away from the melee below. Then a loud clap of snapping rock rang out, and Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s perch swayed precariously back the opposite direction. Mandri scrambled to grab hold of something, to stop himself from spilling out of his hole and into the open air, and just as his hip began to slide, a thunderous faulting of joints echoed up from below, and a puff of smoke shot up behind it. The whole terrifying thing swayed away yet again, before settling into an unstable, precipitous tilt. What was left of Minting Rock dithered there, letting the terror in Mandri get nice and settled, until, at last, there came a shattering CRACK, and the structure began to fall. Mandri braced himself in that half-shorn tomb as the horizon fell out of the sky.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The whole structure rolled onto its back like a freshly halved melon. Mandri could do nothing but look to the sky and feel useless. If there were clouds they would have been zipping by, but there was only that gradient of blue shifting into a deeper blue, and for the first time ever, Mandri noticed that the desert sky is a bluer blue than any other. He didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have time to wonder why that was, for amid the rush and tumble, his sight was swallowed up by a cloud of black-red dust and a suffocating blur of sand and stone. Before Mandri could fully realize the horror of being buried alive, the rock wall underneath him snapped, his room split open, and the half holding him sprung loose like a tensioned lever, catapulting him into the air. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri flew like a dart a few yards above the earth. He flew like that demon woman Pell flew at his ox, Gil. Such was his speed that he smashed right through the brambles of a karkle bush before tumbling into a ragdoll skip along the surface of the hot sand.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When he finally came to a stop, he found himself half buried in a fledgling dune.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He was alive.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He pulled himself free from the sand, spit some of it out of his mouth, coughed a bit of dust out of his lungs, then rubbed his eyes open, surprised to see that his scrawny self was still well-put-together. The shoulder which had borne the brunt of impact wasn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t even dislocated. There weren\u8217\'92t any bones sticking out, at least. And while the demon bite on his leg was still smarting, Purl\u8217\'92s poultice was still knotted tight. Everything else was where it was supposed to be. The only thing that really hurt was the left side of his face, which had scraped against the sand. Still, that was nothing. Considering everything, that was nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He looked over his shoulder, back at the at the settling dust and the crumbling mound of rubble that once was Minting Rock, and he knew that he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d survived in the luckiest way. It was a miracle. A miracle coming after a string of miracles. By rights he should be dead three times over. He\u8217\'92d been stabbed in the chest, he\u8217\'92d been chewed up by a drag-belly, and now he\u8217\'92d survived a fall from near the top of a crumbling stone edifice, yet here he was, alive and breathing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Huh,\u8221\'94 Mandri grunted.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was a such curt grunt, yet inside it was a nugget of something profound: Mandri was starting to consider that he was, in fact, the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He looked up at the sun and sky. The Painted Eunuch. The Eunuch Painter. The Failed Painter. Perhaps that was him. He was being preserved for a purpose. He was invincible. That thought put a smile on his face.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He muttered aloud, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Whatever you think you are, Mandri, you\u8217\'92re not.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 And that was the closest he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d ever gotten to praising Solraheen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Unfortunately, this quiet reverie was disturbed by the rude shout of a Hrkan soldier coming from behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Die, you rangy lizard!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri turned and saw a mustachioed man in a sparkling white cloak running at him with his blade drawn high. Despite the look of fury and rage twisting this soldier\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s face, Mandri wasn\u8217\'92t frightened. Actually, he felt a confidence brewing. If he was supposed to be dead three times over, then what was a fourth? If he was the Failed Painter, living through this would add to the proof.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He held up his hands and shouted, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I surrender!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier slowed to a march and stomped the rest of the way towards Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s pitiful .}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man snarled when he saw that Mandri truly had no intention of fighting.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Coward,\u8221\'94 he said, then he flicked his sword and said, \u8220\'93Get up.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri stood up.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Walk.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Walk where?\u8221\'94 Mandri asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The man pointed off behind Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s shoulder. At first Mandri thought he was pointing at the rubble of Minting Rock, then he noticed, some fifty yards to the right of it, a detachment of Hrkan soldiers. They were standing shoulder to shoulder, twenty-something in all, a fine shout of discipline.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s captor prodded the small of Mandri\u8217\'92s back with the tip of his blade, and Mandri began to walk. As they looped around the rubble, the rubble came alive with unmistakable sounds of battle: breathless shouts of fury, metal clanging against metal, a staccato burst of excited yips, punctuated here and there by a cry of agony.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The first actual figure Mandri saw was Moto. The Zosan was crouching atop a tall, slanted chunk of floor, and with one hand he steadied himself, and with the other he deftly waved off three Hrkan spears with his sword.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Purl came scrambling out from a hole in the rubble nearby, and she stabbed one of the Hrkan bellies with her knife before sprinting into the sandy smoke. Two Hrkan cloaks sprinted after her, but both came suddenly to sudden, fluttering stop after something slammed into their chests. The sound of their deaths was a bone-crunching WHUMP, and the two men collapsed in the middle of the battlefield, a grand death, grandly framed by the two crumbled halves of Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Standing over them was Ayram.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The giant was so caked in red dust that he didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t look like a creature of flesh and blood, but sand. The upper part of his robe was hanging in tatters over his waistband, and his long black hair was sweeping his shoulders clean as he twirled a blackened, cast iron bar that was nearly as tall as himself - it was a spud bar, with a knob at one end, and a flat chisel head on the other. Mandri knew that bar must weigh at least thirty pounds, yet Ayram twirled it as if it were a toothpick.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 All that was left of the Hrkan force sent into this battle, all that Mandri could see, were six young soldiers. These men moved to surround Ayram. They kept their shields up, kept their footwork clean, kept their spears steady under their arms - then Ayram swung his spud bar in a swooping arc, and all discipline went to . The iron bar crunched through the shield arm of one Hrk, and then the chisel-head sliced through the face of another. The rest of the hapless soldiers charged and stabbed, but such was Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s speed that he spun his bar around in time to splinter the shafts of their spears. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Each soldier in turn jumped back to avoid the . One of them picked up a rock and threw it at Ayram\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s head, and before Mandri could see how Ayram dealt with it, he felt a sharp prodding in his back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Get a move on!\u8221\'94 The soldier behind him shouted. The man was evidently unconcerned that his comrades had just suffered terribly. He was more interested in getting Mandri to the Hrkan line. So impatient was he, that he took Mandri by the wrist, upped the pace to a jog, yanking a distracted Mandri along behind him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When they got to the Hrkan detachment, the soldier threw Mandri down into the sand, then set the cold edge of his blade on the back of Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s neck to keep his head bowed in obeisance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier then pounded his chest twice - the standard Hrkan salute - and then he said, in bark of a well-drilled soldier, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My lord Mayzdariga, I\u8217\'92ve found another skulking bandit.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri dared to look up. Standing before him was a child robed in black.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Obo had said that the Mazydariga were child-like, but this was a literal child, a brown-skinned Jandri boy no more than five years old. So short was he, that Mandri, kneeling, could meet him eye to eye. And Obo had said they were twisted creatures, but this child looked tortured, not twisted. In the place of a nose the child wore a flat metallic device in the shape of a nose, and that was riveted onto a leather band, and that was strapped on round the head. The child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes were so bloodshot that the edges seemed on the cusp of bleeding. Even so they were still filled with a childlike curiosity.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Next this Mazydariga child was a bald, pudgy . Unlike the other Hrkans, this man wore the garb of a venal palace scribe - a pale blue robe with long, baggy sleeves, and a . He had a soft, chubby look about him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 This scribe looked down at Mandri, and with plain derision in his voice, he said, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Another coward lurking in the rubble.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Then the Mazydariga spoke, if coming a little sluggish from the throat bothered by phlegm.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He smells like a Mazydai.\u8221\'94 There was no hint of menace in the child\u8217\'92s words, this was merely a statement of fact. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 the scribe said thoughtfully, before turning to address to soldier who\u8217\'92d captured Mandri. \u8220\'93The Lord told you to fetch the Mazyd\u8217\'92s body, not fetch a sniveling rat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes sir. Yes, my lord.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The soldier saluted again, then ran back towards the corpse of Minting Rock.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As the soldier fluttered away, Mandri found the courage to speak, now that his neck was free from a threatening blade. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My lord, thank you for rescuing me!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Mazyadriga child\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes went wide in surprise.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I was a prisoner of these bandits. I\u8217\'92m not with these people, I was captured.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The child looked up at his scribe. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93My lord, he is lying to you,\u8221\'94 the scribe said to his little master. \u8220\'93This one is a ruffian, just like the rest of them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is he?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93He is, my lord. We shall keep him with the other one.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribe nodded to a nearby soldier, and the soldier marched over, dragged Mandri to his feet, and led him over to where one of the Ayramun, Seb, was kneeling, hands bound behind his back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri was about to kneel beside him, when suddenly, a horn sounded and the whole Hrkan line saluted. The Horn sounded again and the marched towards minting rock. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 By the time they got to the whole bloody scene was laid bare. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Bodies, mostly Hrkan, literred amongst the rubble. Interspersed throughout the rubble were hints of crushed Ayramun; a limp hand sticking from a, shreds of robes and literring the rubble. Everywhere there dried up bodies like the ones in the tomb that Mandri had. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  The only people alive were Ayramun. There weren\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t many of them. They huddled together in the middle of the arena. Moto, Elrahet, Purl, , and of course, Ayram. They watched the untroubled Hrkans stroll into arena. A Hrkan commander gave a shout, and the so}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribed stepped forth to address the Ayramun.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93The battle is over. Lay down your or arms.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Actual expectation this would be done.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Since you have proved yourselves to be ruffians outside the natural laws which governs man, you will be dealt according to the law of beasts, and so you shall be sold in the court of Hababeen, the governor of Eez. If you persist in your barbarity, we shall undress your weight with a dull blade, and feed your trimmings to the pigs.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram makes no motion to surrender.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Regent motions for prisoners brought in.}
