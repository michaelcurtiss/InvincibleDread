\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The mechanics of it is simple: expectations turn the vividness of the present moment into an ignorable blur. Only when something \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91strange\u8217\'92 occurs does a person transfixed by expectations pay attention to what is really happening around them. Even then, there\u8217\'92s no guarantee they\u8217\'92ll see the beauty of it.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s not hard to understand why the bound book calls for people to live without expectations.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 After all, what is something strange but something improbable, and can\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t the improbable be explained away by the fact that the world is small and full of chance encounters? }
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 for as the Bound Book says:}
\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i1 An empty well is also filled with purpose,}
\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i1 An arrow in the dirt has also hit its mark,}
\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i1 He weaves all mysteries just below the surface,}
\par\plain {\f2\fs24\b0\i1 If one had but righteous eyes to pierce the dark.}
\par\plain \f2\fs24\b0\i1
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 But whether they admit it or not, Solraheen\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s will is there and it is always there. It\u8217\'92s there in the great and the small, in the mundane and the truly awesome, all it takes is righteous eyes to see it. }

\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Elrahet - I hate questions. The amount effort it takes to ask a question is nothing compared the effort to answer.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Seb, your personality is like a weed. Every time I pull it out, it grows right back.}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t see it? This is a glimpse into the divine pattern!\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s not worth noticing strange coincidences because everything that happens is strange.  Some coincidences may }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 seem}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  more strange than others, but that\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s just a symptom of expectations, which are themselves a symptom of ignorance. A Mazydai would go even further and warn that having even the simplest expectation about what should or should not happen is a grave sin. It\u8217\'92s a sin of pride, they warn, because the ultimate cause of all events is Solraheen\u8217\'92s will, so to expect that something will happen is to place expectations on Solraheen Himself.}}
