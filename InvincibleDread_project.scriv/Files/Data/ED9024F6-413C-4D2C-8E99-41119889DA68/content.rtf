\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re up looking at the stars.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle is like, the void is beautiful.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Thats not the void.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What are you talking about. That empty blackness between the stars.}
\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No. The Void\u8230\'85  it is a difficult thing to imagine because it is not merely\u8216\'91empty blackness\u8217\'92. The word\u8216\'91empty\u8217\'92 suggests space, form, and dimension. \u8216\'91Blackness\u8217\'92 suggests color, surface, and light. But the Void has none of these things. It\u8217\'92s not something you can see, or even notice. It\u8217\'92s not, \u8216\'91where the stars aren\u8217\'92t\u8217\'92, because it has no position. It\u8217\'92s got no properties at all save one: things can come out of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93But if things can come }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 out}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  of it, then it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s got to have -\u8220\'93}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shut up Pyetle.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Are you not familiar with the true story of creation?\u8221\'94 Pella asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not as you would tell it,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Well, the Void is the place - I shouldn\u8217\'92t say \u8216\'91the place\u8217\'92. I\u8217\'92ll just say, things come out of the Void. Leave it at that. What\u8217\'92s important is that the grandest of things which came was the Will of Being.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93This I\u8217\'92ve heard,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It oozed into existence like a heavy smoke,\u8221\'94 Pella said. \u8220\'93It seeped through the tight gaps at the edges of reality\u8217\'92s seal. Eons passed and it coalesced into a fertile cloud. Think of it as a \u8216\'91cloud of potentiality\u8217\'92.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. And then Sol came along and used it to create Life.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, no, no, no. No. There are no Gods yet. There is only this \u8216\'91cloud of potentiality\u8217\'92. What we call the Essence of Will. But that\u8217\'92s not the only thing which came from the void. There are other voidclouds. Things like Chaos, Harmony, Despair. How they can sustain themselves without the Will of Being, thats a matter for philosophers. But when these voidclouds mingle with the stuff of Will , thats when things like you and me come into being. Everything tangible is a unique mixture of different quantities of voidcloud. Gods are no different. Sol included. He\u8217\'92s just made of denser stuff.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I thought Sol created everything.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Sure, that\u8217\'92s what the Empire teaches, but their priests know the truth. Really. I can tell you for a fact that they learn it even the first few years of training. That Sol and humankind are brothers. But it\u8217\'92s an esoteric story and they dont tell it fo political reasons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Political reasons?\u8221\'94 Pyetle said doubtful.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Politcal reasons,\u8221\'94 Pella said as she showed him the scar which wrapped around her neck.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seculla: Do you think he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s a god?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Who? Ayram?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Who else?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 I can see why you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d wonder.  But no, I don\u8217\'92t think so.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s possible though, right?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Eh.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Why not?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Well if something came from the Void, and it mingled with the Will of Being in just the right way, then I guess it is possible. But primordial things manifest as mountains. Storms. I just don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t think a fleshy prison could contain anything like that. At least not without it being obvious.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ve seen the things Ayram can do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 When I say obvious, I mean things like\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8230\'85 I don\u8217\'92t know. Like there\u8217\'92s old Jandri tales of a man with glowing eyes and skin shining as bright like fire. Ayram\u8217\'92s just tall. And serious.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But the things he can do.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Being a skilled fighter doesn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t make you a god, Seculla. With his frame, I\u8217\'92d be more inclined to believe he was divine if he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  handle himself in a fight. Why are you wondering all this? Does it have to do with how he found you?}

\par\plain \f0\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pella explaining the truth about the gods}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Gods did not come first. Life came first. From life came the gods. But also Man and Woman. The gods are our brothers and sisters. Older brothers, sure. Some much, much younger. But there is no natural hierarchy to Life\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s creation. The empire teaches as such only because the Gods demand it. The empire encourages their worship only because it ensures their own survival. }
