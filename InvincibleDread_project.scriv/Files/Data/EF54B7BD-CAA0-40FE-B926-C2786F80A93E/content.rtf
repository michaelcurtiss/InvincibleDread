That sum had been set by some early Hrkan Lord, with the intention of opening up trade with that fabled city flush with gold. When Batata found it, he said that Kurbaku was little more than a dump of mud brick huts. There was almost no gold, and even less hospitality. His revelation caused a stir amongst the scribes and merchants, and many didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t believe him, they didn\u8217\'92t }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 want}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  to believe him. He was under great professional pressure to admit he was lying, but yet again, he was proved true - Kurbaku was several centuries removed from it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s golden apogee.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 So why would Batata lie about Shis?}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The scribal consensus surrounding his map of Shis was that Batata had made the map to scare common folk into virtue. They claimed that Batata was a scribe himself, and as such, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d dedicated himself to the furtherance of Solraheen\u8217\'92s kingdom, and scare tactics were common to scribes and priests of those ancient days. It was part of an Old Jandri creed, often written on the tombs of long-dead kings who didn\u8217\'92t have the Mazydai to keep the social order:}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1  Justice without virtue is blind, virtue without terror is impotent}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . People have got to be scared or else they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ll loosen their lips, loosen their hips, and start stabbing at anything that walks.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandri\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s estimation was that this explanation of the map\u8217\'92s purpose was workable, but not reasonable. He thought Batata was, like himself, a man of integrity who put great care into his work, not the kind of person to let a spiritual scare tactic sully his more serious work. It\u8217\'92d be one thing to have fun aside, but in all of Batata\u8217\'92s serious maps which outlined Jandria\u8217\'92s true shape, there were always a few small dots creeping out in the void the Sand like spiders, each with a postscript saying, }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 Shiskason}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 , or, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Entrance into Shis.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 These dots were so far out into the desert, and so far away from any road, that no rational person would try and verify their truth. Batata himself said that these dots were just approximations, and that he had only stumbled onto these \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93gashes in the earth\u8221\'94 by pure happenstance - as they\u8217\'92re not things that can be seen from a distance.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 There is one moth-eaten scroll where Batata accounts his descent into one of these \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91gashes\u8217\'92, and from this journey he gained the knowledge of Shis\u8217\'92s outlay. It is a poetic work, without much poetic value, as it was written in a mind-numbing meter which was the style for the more narrative works of the day. Even if half its lines weren\u8217\'92t eaten away, Mandri wouldn\u8217\'92t have , .Yet, there was one refrain, however, that stuck with him over the years.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Batata recounted how he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d been stumbling through the pitch black, torch in hand, and the first sing of Shis was a massive stone gate, tall and narrow, a horizontal mantelpiece supported by perfectly plumb and squared beams. Engraved into these pillars was a ancient creed, and hereafter Batata it became known as the creed of Schisol. It rhymes in Old Jandri, but written out in common, it reads:}}
