\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen was a poet and Seculla was a trial lawyer. It might seem that these two callings are as distant from each other as Man is from Woman, but according to Seculla, they were essentially the same. A poet and a lawyer both play with the Truth and appeal to human nature. The poet crafts verse and hopes that it will sing when played on the human heart, and the lawyer does the same, just does it more bluntly, with less rhyming and more certainty. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We are poets whose audience settles matters of life and death,\u8221\'94 she\u8217\'92d say. \u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s the only real difference. That and the fact that a lawyer gets paid by the hour.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Whenever Mandrameen would lay with Seculla he\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d tease her about this. He would say, with a great deal of comic exaggeration, that if a lawyer is just a poet working for money then a lawyer is no better than a whore. Money cheapens Virtue. A whore cheapens Love. A lawyer cheapens the Truth. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Seculla would wave him off with her usual air of grace. She\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d argue that there\u8217\'92s no such thing as the Truth. A single murder recounted by three different witnesses will result in three different stories. Unless there\u8217\'92s a bloody knife in hand we are all invincibly ignorant. Almost everything boils down to a he-said she-said, and everyone picks a side. Might as well get paid to do it. At least a lawyer\u8217\'92s accounting of the Truth is put through peer review. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It is little wonder that the two disagreed on how Jeketian society should be structured. Mandrameen believed that morality was written on the hearts of men. He believed in Humans were endowed by the Gods with natural rights. The Law should emanate from these and protect them. Seculla would say that it didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t matter what anyone }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 thought}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  the law should be, there\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s only what it is: a practical thing for resolving disputes, and it is subject to circumstance, politics, and power. No one has anything by natural right; you only have what you can take for yourself, and you\u8217\'92ll have it for as long as you can defend it. The only law written on the hearts of men is that of Self-Interest.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Perhaps if Seculla had been alive to see the dynamics within Ayram\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s band, she might not have been so quick to doubt that Humanity has an intrinsic moral compass. Perhaps if Mandrameen had seen it, he might not have liked the direction that the compass's needle was pointing. It didn\u8217\'92t point to Liberty or Virtue, it pointed to Ayram.}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://A276867B-71C2-46AA-86BA-5CD3BCA1605D"}{\fldrslt\f1\fs24\b0\i0  He was a Law unto himself. }}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Split up!\u8221\'94 he shouted, his voice echoing round the pit. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Hill grabbed the scruff of Pyetle\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s cloak and pulled him up, then led him to one side of the pit. There they were surrounded by all the other men. On the other side of the pit were the women.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pella!\u8221\'94 Ayram barked. Pella then led the women, about ten of them, into the cave. Ayram followed.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Where are they going?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked Hill.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You want to find out?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yes. You mean you don\u8217\'92t know?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I never asked.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 A gruff voice behind them in spoke. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s ain\u8217\'92t your business to ask what Ayram do with the women.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Sob is right.\u8221\'94 Hill said. \u8220\'93Pyetle, this is Sob.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle turned. Sob was standing close. He was a tall, scrawny man. A rugged Northerner. His thin face was twisted uniformly to the left as if something had knocked it that way as a babe and it just kept growing in that direction. It was so askew that even though he was looking straight down at Pyetle, one of his eyes was blocked by his nose, which was nearly in profile. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well, then what is it we\u8217\'92re doing?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m gonna get you out o\u8217\'92 those tatters,\u8221\'94 said Sob. \u8220\'93Go on.\u8221\'94 He pointed to a wicker basket. It was sitting in the shade of a tarred leather canvas. It was filled past the brim with shirts, cloaks, and woolen wraps.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Whose are those?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93They be Ayrams.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I wont fit in those.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No. Everything\u8217\'92s Ayram\u8217\'92s \u8216\'91ere. Cloths on me back. Even your tatters. Go on. Pick summat out.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle walked over and dug through the basket. He pulled out the few things that looked like they would fit: a light linen tunic that was crumpled with salt and sweat, a pair of brown leather pants with a stripe sewn vertically down the sides, and a pair of rawhide sandals that perfectly fit. The shirt had a blood stain around the collar.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Those be Papi\u8217\'92s things.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I thought you said they were Ayram\u8217\'92s.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t get smaht. Papi was wearin \u8216\'91em. Everything\u8217\'92s Ayram\u8217\'92s.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well who is Papi?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Papillian? Lad\u8217\'92s dead now. Not three days, yet.\u8221\'94 Sob\u8217\'92s mouth twisted into a smile. \u8220\'93He was wearin yorn clothes, he was.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suppose you\u8217\'92ve got anything else.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve still got the cloak,\u8221\'94 Hill said optimistically. \u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s saved you once.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Did it, now?\u8221\'94 Sob asked. Hill nodded.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yes, he\u8217\'92s got a lucky cloak.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93A lucky cloak, does he? Well now he\u8217\'92s got unlucky everything else, I think.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Maybe my luck will even out,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Sob slapped him on the back. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Not sure it works thatta way, Pyetle,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93You either got good luck or bad luck. No such thing as \u8216\'91no luck\u8217\'92, cause that\u8217\'92s just bad luck.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You have good luck?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oi, right I do, right I do. It\u8217\'92s my coins that do it.\u8221\'94 Sob shook a bag of coins that was strung to his belt. \u8220\'93I count them whenever things start to get irey.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93How much you got?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93A full siver-string if you could believe it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s eyes widened. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You carry that around wherever you go?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93He does.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oi. They me lucky coins.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What if Ayram wanted them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well, they\u8217\'92re not your coins, right? They\u8217\'92re Ayram\u8217\'92s. You said -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What are you all on my coins fer?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Calm down, Sob.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Hold on, Hill. I want to know what he\u8217\'92s on my coins fer.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93He new blood, Sob. Calm down.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Sob leaned down and put his face close to Pyelte\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s and said, \u8220\'93I kin see \u8216\'91round corners.\u8221\'94 He turned his head to the right to show that he really could. \u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t you try anythin\u8217\'92 on me coins or anythin else.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Okay, Sob. Fetch the Seilsi some clothes.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0  }
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle first saw it that day in the pit. After Mazyd was , and the mood had settled, Ayram separated the .}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Insert examples}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 It was strange to Pyetle, but he could see the natural sense of it. Ayram was just that big. He seemed ageless. In the evening, at the golden hour, when they climbed out of the pit and headed south over a plain of pink gypsum and salt, to where the horses were hidden, Pyetle thought he could see Ayram\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s shadow extending all the way out to the horizon. There was room enough in it to fit all of Humanity.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah trudged up along side him. She was his minder.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The time is come, Pyetle\u8221\'94 she said. Pyetle paused to catch his breath. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Time for what?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We are going out to the Sand. As big as it be, there\u8217\'92s no room there for outsiders. So, you need to be making a decision.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Are you with us?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yes,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m here. I\u8217\'92m with you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Being with us means being one of us. Part of the body.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re telling me to pull my weight.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Kind of. I don\u8217\'92t know why Ayram brought you here. You ain\u8217\'92t no killer, and you too old to learn. You don\u8217\'92t offer to help with anything, so you can\u8217\'92t be a roper.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93A roper?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah nodded. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93A roper. It\u8217\'92s what I call it. I\u8217\'92m a roper. We tie the group together, keep things running smooth.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Ah.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Every now and then, someone tries to run, and I rope them down.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t need to threaten me. I\u8217\'92m not going to run anywhere.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah laughed. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a figure of speech, Pyetle. Can I call you Pye?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle shrugged.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Alright, Pye. What I mean is, sometimes some people forget what we doin it for, or they get sad, lonely, or just sick of it - the Sand ain\u8217\'92t a fun place to be - and that\u8217\'92s when I step in with my sunny disposition.\u8221\'94 She looked at Pyetle and put on a big smile. Pyetle couldn\u8217\'92t help but smile back.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You\u8217\'92re in charge of morale?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I ain\u8217\'92t in charge of nothing. I do what I can for people cause I want to. You have to want to do it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t think I\u8217\'92m that kind of person?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Obviously. That\u8217\'92s why I\u8217\'92m talkin to ya. If you ain\u8217\'92t good in a fight, then you need to be good out of it. So Pye, what good are ya?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well\u8230\'85 I know bean-curd.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Bean-curd?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Bean products, but mostly bean curd.\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93No. It\u8217\'92s more the buying and selling of it. I would buy soy-bean in bulk from farmers out in -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93You a middle-man?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle nodded. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s not as simple as that, but...I guess it doesn\u8217\'92t matter. Not many beans out here.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah laughed. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Not much buyin or sellin either.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I guess I could help out with whatever you need help with.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah shook her head. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Nah. We\u8217\'92ll find somethin. Ayram put you here, Pye. I learnt a long time ago that he knows best. But still, you need to make a decision to buy in - not just \u8216\'91cause we don\u8217\'92t tolerate outsiders. It\u8217\'92s for your own safety.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Safety from what?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93And what does that involve?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It ain\u8217\'92t nothin serious. Well, it\u8217\'92s serious, but I mean, it ain\u8217\'92t nothin too painful.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Too painful?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s a blood oath, Pye. There\u8217\'92s gonna to be blood.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle grimaced. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I don\u8217\'92t suppose I have a choice?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, we\u8217\'92d kill you if you say no. But you shouldn\u8217\'92t take the oath just because you don\u8217\'92t want us to kill you.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle laughed.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What?\u8221\'94 Moteah asked. \u8220\'93You\u8217\'92ve got to be doing it for the right reasons.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What reasons are those?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah shrugged. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s different for everyone.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Why did you join up?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Nah. That\u8217\'92s between me and Ayram.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93So I either take the oath, or you kill me. That just doesn\u8217\'92t seem like\u8230\'85 Well, let\u8217\'92s say I took the oath, but I just said the words without meaning them.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93There\u8217\'92s no words.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well, ok.... Let\u8217\'92s say I just went through the motions.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It ain\u8217\'92t that kind of oath. It\u8217\'92s more\u8230\'85 how should I say it\u8230\'85 It\u8217\'92s more primitive. Maybe oath ain\u8217\'92t the right word.\u8221\'94 Moteah stood up. \u8220\'93You got until we reach them hills over there.\u8221\'94 She pointed ahead to the tall foothills of the Junei Mountains. At their pace, they\u8217\'92d reach them by nightfall.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Is that where the horses are?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked, eager to get in a saddle.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah nodded. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Just about.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well I can already tell you,\u8221\'94 Pyetle said as he stood up. \u8220\'93I\u8217\'92m in.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Alright.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle looked behind them, and say that Mazyd was struggling along. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What about Mazyd?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0         \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93The Seilsi?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What about him?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well, Urghiz is a long way off.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Yeah.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0         \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93He\u8217\'92s in pretty bad shape. You think he\u8217\'92s going to make it?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Shit, I don\u8217\'92t know if you gonna to make it.\u8221\'94 Moteah looked Pyetle up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness. \u8220\'93You don\u8217\'92t know how bad it is out there. It\u8217\'92s not just the heat.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ve been on caravans.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We ain\u8217\'92t keep to the roads.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Well if you\u8217\'92re concerned about me, then how is he gonna make it?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked, nodding in Mazyd\u8217\'92s direction. Moteah stopped him, and looked in his eyes with intent.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pye, I\u8217\'92m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi, and there was no telling what he was capable of. There were rumors that Seilsi had strange biologies, but these rumors always conflicted, so Pyetle never gave them credence. One day a man would claim he saw a Seilsi jump over a crowd just because he could, while another would say he saw a Seilsi struggle to get up into a saddle. Some said they could see through walls, others said they were nearly blind.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 There was a lot unusual about Mazyd\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I could help with the Seilsi,\u8221\'94 Pyetle suggested.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I am worrying about myself. I\u8217\'92m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that\u8217\'92s something I could do.\u8221\'94 }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Moteah rolled her eyes. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I\u8217\'92ll ask Pella about it.\u8221\'94 She turned back to the course and trudged along. \u8220\'93Come on, we almost there.\u8221\'94 }
