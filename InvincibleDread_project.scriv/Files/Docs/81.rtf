\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen and Seculla first met at a party. It was a government function - some Imperial Senator was entertaining some foreign dignitary - so the wine was thin and the air was thick with ambition. Not a place for depressed people. The pretension wears on them. They filter down to one corner of the room where they cluster together for sanity. That was where Seculla found Mandrameen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen was depressed because he came from old money. Not a sympathetic cause. Even he, with his prodigious creative talent, couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t mix and match words well enough to communicate the depth of it. Instead, he settled for talking about it in the abstract, and so he spoke to Seculla and a few others about how he hated the word \u8216\'91depression\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  A \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 depression\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92 is just a bit of land that\u8217\'92s a little lower than the surrounding area, he\u8217\'92d say. It can vary in size, but if you\u8217\'92re walking along, you\u8217\'92ll get through it in good time with no great effort. It\u8217\'92s not like climbing a mountain or swimming across the sea, it\u8217\'92s just a phase in what is otherwise perfectly healthy, normal, level ground. In other words, a depression is not very depressing.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen thought the use of the word \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91depression\u8217\'92 as a label for his private psychological devastation was prejudicial. It gave well-put-together people the wrong idea about him; made them feel that they understood where he was coming from. After all, everyone\u8217\'92s been sad, so everyone\u8217\'92s been through a little depression, so everyone thinks they\u8217\'92ve got the place mapped; but a real meaty nihilistic stupor, well Mandrameen knew it wasn\u8217\'92t on any goddamn map.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 At this point, Seculla had grown so annoyed with Mandrameen\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s tortured analogy, that she felt compelled to step in. She pointed out that the most desolate and tortured place on earth, the Saldrian Waste, is a depression. It\u8217\'92s an immense bowl of sand and it comprises almost a third of the continent. Unrelenting winds have whipped it since the dawn of creation: the S}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://855994A1-EE6B-44C7-87F8-FB8396011B91"}{\fldrslt\f1\fs24\b0\i0 hamal}}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  sweeps in from the Caltian Sea, and the Kharif brings Monsoons in from the south-west. }
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ql\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The Saldrian is not just a true desert, Seculla argued, it is }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 the}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  desert. No one has ever made it through the heart of it, much less to the Inner Mountain and back again. If ever there was a fitting analogy for despair, it was the Saldrian. As such, \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91Depression\u8217\'92 is a fitting word. She added that the Saldrian most certainly }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 was}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  on a map.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen was too sentimental about the desert to agree with her. It was unforgiving, yes, but for him it was full of mystery and feminine allure - it was there to be unveiled, exposed, and penetrated.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Eventually (and this took hours) the wine worked enough agreeableness into them that they shared a conclusion: the feature of the earth which best captured the sense of despair was the Underworld. There\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s no sun there. You can only see as far as the light that you carry.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 What they did  consider was how darkness . That would have ruined the analogy, because Mandrameen and Seculla, both secure in their station near the top of the social structure, did not know fear. If they had ever been forced to creep through the damp dark of the underworld, as Pyetle was now forced, they would have agre}
