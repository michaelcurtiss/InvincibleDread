\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen and Seculla first met at an evening river party. It was a government function, some Imperial Senator was entertaining some foreign dignitary, and so the wine was thin and the air was thick with ambition - not a place for depressed people. They don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have the }{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://D7AFFFEF-25BE-4387-9AC8-D2A076506A26"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0\i0 stamina}}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  for it. Both Mandrameen and Seculla filtered through the pretension and settled down into one corner of the tent where they clustered together for sanity. This sparked a relationship. They began to write letters back and forth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen never explained to her that he was depressed because he came from old money. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not a sympathetic cause and so even he, with his prodigious creative talent, couldn\u8217\'92t mix and match words well enough to communicate the depth of it. Instead, he settled for talking about it in the abstract. He wrote to Seculla about how he hated the word \u8216\'91depression\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  He remarked that a \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 depression\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92 is just a bit of land that\u8217\'92s a little lower than the surrounding area. It can vary in size, but if you\u8217\'92re walking along  you\u8217\'92ll get through it in good time with no great effort. It\u8217\'92s not like climbing a mountain or swimming across the sea; it\u8217\'92s just a phase in what is otherwise perfectly healthy, normal, level ground. In other words, a depression is not very depressing.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen thought the use of the word was prejudicial. It gave well-put-together people the wrong idea about him; made them feel that they understood where he was coming from. After all, everyone\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s been sad, so everyone\u8217\'92s been through a little depression, so everyone thinks they\u8217\'92ve got the place mapped - but a real meaty nihilistic stupor, well Mandrameen knew it wasn\u8217\'92t on any goddamn map. You get lost there. You don\u8217\'92t come back.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Seculla wrote back that he was, again, being foolish. She pointed out that the most desolate and tortured place in the world, the Saldrian Waste, was a depression. It\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s an immense bowl of sand and it comprises almost a third of the continent. Unrelenting winds have whipped it since the dawn of creation: the S}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://855994A1-EE6B-44C7-87F8-FB8396011B91"}{\fldrslt\f1\fs24\b0\i0 hamal}}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  blows in from the Caltian Sea, and the Kharif brings monsoons in from the south-west. }
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ql\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The Saldrian is not just a true desert, Seculla argued, it is }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 the}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  desert. No one has ever made it through the heart of the Empty Portion, much less to the Inner Mountain and back again. If ever there was a fitting object for Mandrameen\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s analogy, it was the Saldrian, it was a depression, and it most certainly }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 was}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  on a map.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 But Mandrameen was too sentimental about the Saldrian to agree with her. The desert was unforgiving, yes, but for him it was full of mystery and feminine allure - it was a blank spot on a map, full of secrets yet to be unveiled, exposed, and penetrated. He\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d wax on about virginal passages and rich young men who fought to be the first to get through. Besides, the Gods lived there, the Desert Fathers lived there, and so he couldn\u8217\'92t possibly think of it as depressing.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Eventually, and this took months, subtle lust worked enough agreeableness into them that they shared a conclusion: the feature of the earth best suited to the task was the Underworld. The sun can\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t reach there, so you can only see as far as the light that you carry.  There is no color or life - there\u8217\'92s just the maze of rock, the abyss, and your own private thoughts. There\u8217\'92s nothing to do but wander and wait for death.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 What they didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t consider - what they didn\u8217\'92t know - was how the Underworld breeds a strong fear. That would have ruined the analogy. It\u8217\'92s not a slow, dawning fear that might accent a depression, it\u8217\'92s the sharp, waking fear that turns a man into a timid creature. They just }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 assumed}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  that the abyss is an empty void that you fall into,  but it\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s a chittering-chattering throat that threatens to vomit out teeth and claws and demons should you turn your back. If Mandrameen and Seculla had ever been forced to crawl through the damp dark of the Underworld, as Pyetle was forced by Ayram and Hill, their error would have slapped them in the face.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle cast wary glances into dark tunnels as he passed them. He struggled to figure if the glowing eyes and shifting shadows he saw were real or just glistening bits of rock. Ayram and Hill were moving too quickly to let his eyes linger on any particular fright. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8216\'91Keep moving\u8217\'92 was the order. Not just because of whatever lurked in the deep, but because an icy breeze, the very breath of the earth, could freeze the bone. With only a thin cotton tunic, Pyetle was especially chilled.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Where are we going?\u8221\'94 He whispered as he tramped along behind Hill. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Hill didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t stop to answer. He just grunted. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I just want to know where the hell -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Hill paused and whipped round. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Were you never told stories of Swadin?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle nodded. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Then be}{\f2\fs24\b0\i1  quiet}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 !\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 At this point Ayram had stopped as well. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ve got some miles to cover,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Miles?\u8221\'94 Pyetle mumbled. \u8220\'93You can find your way for miles?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 But Ayram was already turning back round to the path. Hill grunted again and followed along. Pyetle came flying behind.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The way meandered up and down, but it kept to a relative mean. Pyetle expected to be confronted at every turn by a vertical shaft or impassible slump of boulders - and there were plenty of these - but Ayram knew the ways around them. As they shifted around the ledge of one particularly jagged rent in the earth, a rock broke out from under Pyetle\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s foot, and it fell into the darkness. The silence was horrifying. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 After a long age of seconds a stupefying, far-off boom rumbled below.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Twelve seconds,\u8221\'94 Ayram remarked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Makes it what?\u8221\'94 Hill asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Almost a two hundred lengths.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not deep enough.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Deep enough for what?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93To hit a demon on the head.\u8221\'94 Both Hill and Ayram chuckled, but Pyetle couldn\u8217\'92t tell if they were serious.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0  Ayram led them on through winding fissures and low-hung corridors. At times they had to crawl or squeeze through cracks, and again, it was worst for Pyetle. His cotton tunic did nothing to brunt the shocking chill of the rock against his skin. It didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t help that the torch-light\u8217\'92s narration of these passages was unreliable; hidden edges and shadowed protrusions stabbed and bruised his flesh as he scraped along. In an hour his tunic was reduced to rags.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Each time he stumbled out of a crack he found that Ayram and Hill were further and further ahead. When it got to the point that he couldn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t see their figures against torchlight, he yelled for them to wait. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Hill! Ayram!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He hurried along, chasing the orange glow of Hill\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s torch. If it grew any fainter, it would take the rock around him with it. The darkness would push in, close down on him, and he would be lost.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Ayram!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 He rushed round a corner and nearly spilled onto marbled rock. Here the way was carved and polished. The walls were straight and even, and the ceiling was high and lost to shadow. Hill and Ayram were at the distant end of it, standing at the threshold of an enormous door.  }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 They whispered to each other. Hill seemed upset. Ayram shook him away, then pushed on the massive door and stepped into the darkness. It closed behind him. Hill turned round then jumped in fright when he saw Pyetle standing there in the middle distance, dimly lit, half-naked and bloody, with eyes as wide as saucers.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Shyza!\u8221\'94 Hill screamed. \u8220\'93Pyetle! I thought you a witherman!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Not one yet,\u8221\'94 Pyetle grumbled as he marched towards the warmth of Hill\u8217\'92s torch. \u8220\'93But I might be made one soon in this damned place\u8230\'85 Would it kill you to slow down?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Hill smiled. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Sorry. You get my cloak. Here, take this.\u8221\'94 He handed Pyetle the torch, then undid the clasp of his black cloak and unwrapped it, then put it on Pyetle\u8217\'92s shoulders. Pyetle tugged it tight.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Is good?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle nodded.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93What is this place?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked. \u8220\'93Do you live here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, no, no, no, no. This is old, bad place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Then what are we doing here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Oh\u8230\'85 No for me to say. Only, lets say Ayram has business here. But watch this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Tried to distract, but Pyetle wondered what business any man could possibly have behind an omnious door in the underworld.}
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Ayram comes out, Pyetle refuses to move until he knows whats going on. Who are you.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Who am I? You wouldn\u8217\'92t believe it.\u8221\'94}
