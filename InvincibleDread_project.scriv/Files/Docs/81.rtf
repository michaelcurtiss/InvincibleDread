\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen and Seculla first met at an evening river party. It was a government function, some Imperial Senator was entertaining some foreign dignitary, and so the wine was thin and the air was thick with ambition - not a place for depressed people. They don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have the }{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://ECC02B9D-94CB-4528-A5FF-8CC78379AB03"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0\i0 stamina}}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  for it, they just filter through the pretension and settle down into one corner of the tent where they cluster together for sanity. That was where Seculla found Mandrameen.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen was depressed because he came from old money. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not a sympathetic cause and so even he, with his prodigious creative talent, couldn\u8217\'92t mix and match words well enough to communicate the depth of it. Instead, he settled for talking about it in the abstract. He spoke to Seculla and a few others about how he hated the word \u8216\'91depression\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  He would remark that a \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0 depression\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92 is just a bit of land that\u8217\'92s a little lower than the surrounding area. It can vary in size, but if you\u8217\'92re walking along, you\u8217\'92ll get through it in good time with no great effort. It\u8217\'92s not like climbing a mountain or swimming across the sea; it\u8217\'92s just a phase in what is otherwise perfectly healthy, normal, level ground. In other words, a depression is not very depressing.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen thought the use of the word was prejudicial. It gave well-put-together people the wrong idea about him; made them feel that they understood where he was coming from. After all, everyone\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s been sad, so everyone\u8217\'92s been through a little depression, so everyone thinks they\u8217\'92ve got the place mapped - but a real meaty nihilistic stupor, well Mandrameen knew it wasn\u8217\'92t on any goddamn map. You get lost there. You don\u8217\'92t come back.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 At this point Seculla interrupted. She pointed out that the most desolate and tortured place in the world, the Saldrian Waste, was a depression. It\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s an immense bowl of sand and it comprises almost a third of the continent. Unrelenting winds have whipped it since the dawn of creation: the S}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://855994A1-EE6B-44C7-87F8-FB8396011B91"}{\fldrslt\f1\fs24\b0\i0 hamal}}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  blows in from the Caltian Sea, and the Kharif brings monsoons in from the south-west. }
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ql\ltrch\loch {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 The Saldrian is not just a true desert, Seculla argued, it is }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 the}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  desert. No one has ever made it through the heart of it, much less to the Inner Mountain and back again. If ever there was a fitting object for Mandrameen\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s analogy, it was the Saldrian, a depression, and it most certainly }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 was}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  on a map.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 But Mandrameen was too sentimental about the Saldrian to agree with her. The desert was unforgiving, yes, but for him it was full of mystery and feminine allure - it was a blank spot on a map, full of secrets yet to be unveiled, exposed, and penetrated. He\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92d wax on about virginal passages and rich young men who fought to be the first to conquer it\u8217\'92s depths. Besides, the Gods lived there, the Desert Fathers lived there, and so he couldn\u8217\'92t possibly think of it as depressing.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Eventually (and this took hours) the wine worked enough agreeableness into them that they shared a conclusion: the feature of the earth best suited to the task was the Underworld. There\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s no sun there. You can only see as far as the light that you carry.  There is no color or life - there\u8217\'92s just the rock, the abyss, and your own private thoughts. Few ever come back.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 What they didn\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92t consider was how humans have an intrinsic fear of darkness. That would have ruined the analogy. Depression is accented with boredom, not fear - there\u8217\'92s not a hint of it. If they had ever been forced to crawl through the damp dark of the Underworld, as Pyetle was forced by Ayram and Hill, their error would have slapped them in the face. In the Underworld, the abyss isn\u8217\'92t an empty void that you fall into, it\u8217\'92s a chittering-chattering throat that threatens to vomit out teeth and claws and demons should you turn your back on it. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 That was how Pyetle felt, anyways. He cast wary glances into dark tunnels as he passed them, and struggled to figure if the glowing eyes and shifting shadows were real or imagined. Ayram and Hill were moving too quickly to let his mind linger on any particular fright, and for that, at least, he was thankful.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Hey, where are we going?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked as he tramped along behind Hill. Hill stopped, turned around, and put a finger to his lips to shush him. }
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I just want to know where the hell -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Hill interrupted him. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Dammit Pyetle. This }{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 is}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  hell.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 At this point Ayram had stopped as well. \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ve got some miles to cover,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93Miles!?\u8221\'94 Pyetle exclaimed. \u8220\'93This goes for miles?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93It\u8217\'92s called the Under-}{\f2\fs24\b0\i1 world}{\f1\fs24\b0\i0  for a reason.\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8221\'94 Hill said.}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93And you can stay true to a path for miles?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8220\'93I can,\u8221\'94 Ayram said. }
\par\plain \f1\fs24\b0\i0
\par\plain {\f1\fs24\b0\i0 Passage meanders up and down, but relatively level. Pyetle expected to be confronted at every turn by a vertical shaft or impassible slump of debris - and there were plenty of these - but there was a kind of main thorughfare that slumped through the darkness. It was like a great highway under the earth, carved by demons too impatient to care about straight and even lines.}
