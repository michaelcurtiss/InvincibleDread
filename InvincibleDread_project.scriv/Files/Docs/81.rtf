\pard\plain \ltrch\loch \f0\fs24
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen and Seculla first met at an evening river party. It was a government function, some Imperial Senator was entertaining some foreign dignitary, and so the wine was thin and the air was thick with ambition. Not a place for depressed people. They don\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t have the }{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://D7AFFFEF-25BE-4387-9AC8-D2A076506A26"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0\i0 stamina}}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  for it. Both Mandrameen and Seculla filtered through the pretension and collided in one corner of the tent where they clustered together for sanity. This sparked a relationship. They began to write letters back and forth.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen found it difficult to explain that he was depressed because he came from old money. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s not a sympathetic cause and so even he, with his prodigious creative talent, couldn\u8217\'92t mix and match words well enough to communicate the depth of it. Instead, he settled for talking about it in the abstract. He wrote to Seculla about how he hated the word \u8216\'91depression\u8217\'92.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  He remarked that a \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91depression\u8217\'92 is just a bit of land that\u8217\'92s a little lower than the surrounding area. It can vary in size, but if you\u8217\'92re walking along  you\u8217\'92ll get through it in good time with no great effort. It\u8217\'92s not like climbing a mountain or swimming across the sea. It\u8217\'92s just a phase in what is otherwise perfectly healthy, normal, level ground. In other words a depression isn\u8217\'92t depressing. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen thought the use of the word was prejudicial. It gave well-put-together people the wrong idea about him. Made them feel that they understood where he was coming from. After all, everyone\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s been sad, so everyone\u8217\'92s been through a little depression, so everyone thinks they\u8217\'92ve got the place mapped, but a real meaty nihilistic stupor, well Mandrameen knew it wasn\u8217\'92t on any goddamn map. You get lost there. You don\u8217\'92t come back.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Seculla wrote back that he was being, again, a fool. She pointed out that the most desolate and tortured place in the world was a depression: the Empty Portion. It\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s an immense bowl of sand and it comprises almost a third of the continent. Unrelenting winds have whipped it since the dawn of creation: the S}{\field{\*\fldinst HYPERLINK "scrivcmt://855994A1-EE6B-44C7-87F8-FB8396011B91"}{\fldrslt\f0\fs24\b0\i0 hamal}}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  blows in from the Caltian Sea, and the Kharif brings monsoons in from the south-west. }
\par\pard\plain \fi360\ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The Empty Portion is not just a true desert, Seculla argued, it is }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 the}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  desert. No one has ever made it through the heart of it, much less to the Inner Mountain and back again. If ever there was a fitting object for Mandrameen\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s analogy, that was it, and it was a depression, and it most certainly }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 was}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  on a map.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen was too sentimental about the Sands to agree with her. The Empty Portion was unforgiving, yes, but for him it was full of mystery and feminine allure. He\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d wax on about virginal passages and rich young men who fought to be the first to expose and penetrate its secrets. Besides, the Gods lived there, the Desert Fathers lived there, and so he couldn\u8217\'92t possibly think of it as depressing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Eventually, and this took months, subtle lust worked enough agreeableness into them that they shared a conclusion: the feature of the Earth best suited to the task was the Underworld. The sun can\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t reach there, so you can only see as far as the light that you carry. There is no color or life. There\u8217\'92s just the maze of rock, the abyss, and your own private thoughts. There\u8217\'92s nothing to do but wander and wait for death.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 What they didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t consider - what they didn\u8217\'92t know - was Fear.  Not the blunt, cerebral fear that might keep the depressed in bed, but the sharp, waking fear that keeps a man running through the Underworld. Neither Mandrameen nor Seculla had ever }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 truly}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  gazed into the abyss. The real things, the avens of the Earth,  they\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re chittering-chattering throats that threaten to vomit out teeth and claws and demons should you turn your back. They spike the body with tension, they push out all thoughts and worries save one: Back. Out. Slowly. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 If Mandrameen and Seculla had ever been forced to crawl through the damp dark of the Underworld, as Pyetle was forced by Ayram and Hill, their error would have slapped them in the face. The only thing keeping Pyetle from losing his wits entirely was the drink. He couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t fixate on the terror even if he tried.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He would cast wary glances into dark tunnels as he passed them. He struggled to figure if the glowing eyes and shifting shadows he thought he saw were real or just glistening bits of rock. Ayram and Hill were moving too quickly to let his blurry eyes bring any particular fright into focus. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8216\'91Keep moving\u8217\'92 was the order. Not just because of whatever might lurk in the dark, but because an icy breeze, the billows of the Earth, it could freeze the bone. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 With only a thin cotton tunic, Pyetle was especially chilled. The drink helped with that, too.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Where are we going?\u8221\'94 He whispered as he tramped along behind Hill. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t stop to answer. He just grunted. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I just want to know where the hell -\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill paused and whipped round. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Were you never told stories of Swadin?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle nodded. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Then be}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1  quiet}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 !\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 At this point Ayram had stopped as well. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93We\u8217\'92ve got some miles to cover,\u8221\'94 he said.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Miles?\u8221\'94 Pyetle mumbled. \u8220\'93You can find your way for miles?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 But Ayram was already turning back round to the path. Hill grunted again and followed along. Pyetle came flying behind.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The way meandered up and down, but it kept to a relative mean. Pyetle expected to be confronted at every turn by a vertical shaft or impassible slump of boulders - and there were plenty of these - but Ayram knew the ways around them. As they shifted around the ledge of one particularly jagged rent in the earth, a rock broke out from under Pyetle\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s foot, and it fell into the darkness. The silence was horrifying. }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 After a long age of seconds a stupefying, far-off boom rumbled below. Behind it came a cloud of steam and a wheezing, sulfurous hiss. Pyetle thought he saw a flash of green light deep down in the abyss. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Twelve seconds,\u8221\'94 Ayram remarked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That makes it what?\u8221\'94 Hill asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Almost two hundred lengths.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not deep enough.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Deep enough for what?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0\cf1 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Let\u8217\'92s just say,\u8221\'94 Hill said as he looked knowingly at Ayram, \u8220\'93that we\u8217\'92re safe for now.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0  Ayram led them on through a winding fissure and through a series of low-hung corridors. At times they had to crawl or squeeze through cracks, and again, it was worst for Pyetle. His cotton tunic did nothing to brunt the shocking chill of the rock and mud against his skin. It didn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t help that the torch-light\u8217\'92s narration of these passages was unreliable; hidden edges and shadowed protrusions stabbed and bruised his flesh as he scraped along. In an hour his tunic was reduced to wet rags. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Each time he stumbled out of a crack he found that Ayram and Hill were further and further ahead. When it got to the point that he couldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t see their dark figures cut out against torchlight, he yelled for them to wait. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hill! Ayram!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He hurried along, chasing the orange glow of Hill\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s torch. If it grew any fainter it would take the rock around him with it. He could feel the darkness pushing in, closing down on him.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ayram!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He rushed round a corner and nearly spilled onto marbled rock. Here the floor was carved and polished and cut with an intricate diamond pattern. It was as wide as a carriageway. The light of Hill\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s torch climbed up straight and even walls then fell softly into shadow, unable to reach the distant ceiling - if indeed there was one. At the distant end of this great hall, Hill and Ayram stood at the threshold of an enormous double-door.  }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 They were whispering to each other. Hill seemed upset. Ayram shook him away, then pushed on the massive door. An awful grinding noise echoed down the hall towards Pyetle, and once there was enough room for Ayram to slip inside, he went in. Slowly, the door closed behind him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill turned round then jumped in fright when he saw Pyetle standing there in the middle distance, dimly lit, half-naked and muddy, with eyes as wide as saucers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Shyza!\u8221\'94 Hill screamed. \u8220\'93Pyetle! I thought you a witherman!\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Not one yet,\u8221\'94 Pyetle grumbled as he marched towards the warmth of Hill\u8217\'92s torch. \u8220\'93But I might be made one soon in this damned place\u8230\'85 Would it kill you to slow down?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill smiled. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93It could. Here, take this.\u8221\'94 He handed Pyetle the torch, then undid the clasp of his black cloak and unwrapped it, then put it on Pyetle\u8217\'92s shoulders. Pyetle tugged it tight.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93That\u8217\'92s not how you wear it. Wrap it here, across chest, under arm. Yes. There you go. Is good?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle nodded, then turned toward the doors. They were three times his height, arched in the middle, and engraved all up and down in rows were lines of soldiers.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this place?\u8221\'94 Pyetle asked. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, don\u8217\'92t think of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Do you live here?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93No, no, no, no. This is bad, bad place.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Can I go in?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93NO. No, no, no, no.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Hill. Give me something here. I want to know what the hell is going on.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh\u8230\'85 no for me to say. Let\u8217\'92s say that - Ayram do business here. But don\u8217\'92t think of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t think of it? This is incredible! I\u8217\'92ve never even }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 heard}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  of something like this in the Underworld. The fact that people braved this foul place long enough to carve a-\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 Pyetle\u8217\'92s next words got stuck in his throat as his eyes fell upon the carved demon\u8217\'92s head set atop the door frame.  Granite shoulders popped out of the rock next to it, and long, spindly arms spread all the way around the door-frame to the floor, where  hands clutched the bottom of the doors, as if holding them up. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 People }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 built this, right?\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Don\u8217\'92t think of it.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Ugh. Hill, man, what the hell do you expect me to think about? We\u8217\'92re in the Underworld, and}{\f1\fs24\b0\i1  that\loch\af1\hich\af1\dbch\af1\uc1\u8217\'92s  }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 a fucking demon door, and Ayram just }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 walked}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  inside.\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think you still drunk, my friend.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It surprised Pyetle to realize that he }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 was}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  still drunk. He looked back at the door. Nope. Still a demon door.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Come, Pyetle, let me show you a thing.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill took Pyetle by the shoulder and led him back out to the more familiar, more natural, part of the Underworld. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 He stopped at a hole in the ground. It was about two lengths wide and it fell away into the abyss. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Listen to this.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill began to pee into the hole. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle expected to hear a trickling splash, but there was silence. Hill\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s stream just sped away into darkness.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What is this about?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 As if to answer, a tinny, zinging sound came echoing out of the hole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill looked back at Pyetle, smiling from ear to ear.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Is weird, no?\u8221\'94 he asked.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93How does that happen?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill gave his junk a few shakes and put it away. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93I think it have to do with how the rocks shape sound,\u8221\'94 he said. \u8220\'93Go on, have a try.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle handed Hill the torch then stepped over to the hole.  It dropped straight down.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Back up a bit, will you?\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Oh, sorry. Sorry.\u8221\'94}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle turned back to the deep blackness unfolding below his feet. He began to consider what it would be like to fall down it. Would he just hang there in blackness?  The falling wouldn\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92t be so bad - its the blind anticipation of hitting the ground. He\u8217\'92d rather be able to see the bottom. There\u8217\'92d be something cathartic about falling for so long, knowing for at least those seconds that you can\u8217\'92t step back, that your fate is certain, its right }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 there}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  rushing up at you. You\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92re finally done with it. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 His palms began sweat. He pulled out his cock and began to pee before the anxiousness could really have its way with him. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Something brushed his shoulder. He screamed. He slipped. Urine sprayed all about. He fell into the hole.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill screamed after him. \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pyetle! Oh shit!\u8221\'94 He leaped so quickly to where Pyetle had stood that he almost fell down himself. He got down to his knees and lowered the torch down into the hole to see what he could see, but there was nothing.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93Pyetle!\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Hill looked up to the ceiling and muttered a quick blessing to the Gods.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93What do we have here?\u8221\'94}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Pyetle looked up at them - two dark heads cut out against the warm light, one much bigger than the other. Then he looked down into the unfathomable blackness. He wondered which prospect was preferable, up or down. Sure, he\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92d live if he climbed out, but living wasn\u8217\'92t all it\u8217\'92s cracked up to be.
