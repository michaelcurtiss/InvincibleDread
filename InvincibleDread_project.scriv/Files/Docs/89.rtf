\pard\plain \fi360\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The poet Mandrameen once said that every artist who has tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. For him the problem is always the same: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see - but nothing is more seductive than Nature. Nothing can match it\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s grandeur and complexity at scale, for inside every leaf, rock, cloud, and tree are systems within systems, patterns within patterns for as far as it is possible to look. The shock of this beauty goes straight to the spinal cord, and if the mood is right, it hits with an intensity that no poet or painter could hope to achieve.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Mandrameen taught that the Sand focuses this beauty. There the desert heat pulls the mind out from the body, like a cork from a bottle, and if you are left to linger in the sun, near to death, then all desires, plots, and fantasies will evaporate. Nothing is left to support a delicate ego. When Nature\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s beauty rushes in it flushes the ego out, it loses it in the wide open spaces of sand and sky. All that\u8217\'92s left for the inner eye to see is the truth about the edge between one\u8217\'92s self and the Universe.}
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Or so Mandrameen believed. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 It was at least an honest attempt to explain why all religions of the Empire were born in the Sand, and why the beating heart of each of them is the grand city of Jeket, Jewel of the Desert, an oasis in the middle of the world. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The cynic Seculla took a different view. She claimed that prophets and messiahs flock to the Sand - and Jeket in particular - because gold flows through it. The stuff filters into the city from mines in the interior, and once the cut is taken, it leaves down river then out to sea towards Carcina, the Empire\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92s capital. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Whether or not this is true is a matter of taste. But it cannot be denied that, for many folk, gold is more tempting than eternal salvation. After all, gold is just as bright and as immutable as the Divine, but you can }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 touch}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  it. If a pure, soft, sparkling spot of it gets into your hands you\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8217\'92ll be struck with a yearning akin to spiritual rapture, a yearning for more of it, for }{\f1\fs24\b0\i1 as much as you can get}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 . The more enterprising religions channel this effect by casting the gold into idols. They pour it into molds and curse-pots, and they use it to ornament their sacred texts and the walls of their heavenly dwellings. The way that gold scintillates in the candlelight of a dark and cloistered room creates an impression of holiness that is strong enough to lure even the weakest pilgrims out to shrines nestled deep in the Sand. In such hallowed places, the chosen few may hear whispered invitations leap out of the rock, or out of the sand or sky, but godless folk claim that its just the whisperings of the gold, for they hear it too. They can hear it even while it sits in the ground, and like pious men they devote their lives to the call. }
\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The only person on the Earth who worshiped neither the Gods , and neither the Gold, was Ayram. He was religious in his own way, a thief of a kind, but chiefly he was known as Evil, and he was simply too skilled to ever be captured. }}
