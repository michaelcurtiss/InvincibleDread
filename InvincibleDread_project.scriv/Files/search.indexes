            <Text>The Human being is not designed for contentment. It is designed to be unsatisfied. Cruel irony of the gods is that they gave the gift of imagination, and with it you imagine only how your life can be better. This drives you to seek better life, better position, more sustenance. That’s what’s driven them to this! Consorting with demons!

Throne room once carved into the earth like petra. But a great slab, tectonic plate, had shifted, so the whole room sat at angle, the lower right corner forming a gutter in which all manner of debris collected. So there was a flat path along it. Straight to the end of the hall, where a scaffold of stick and brick climbed up the far wall to an angled doorway.
Colmuns which once held the roof had tumbled down and blocked the way. Passages were carved through them. Strangely well kept. Ayram knew the way.
What is this place?
Dark, damp, chittering bats and creatures unspeakable. Odor? Cold Spring water.
At the end there’s a set of stairs, which set sidways was a jagged wall. 
“This was the throne room of an old, old kingdom. A kingdom which once ruled over all of mankind.

Situation where Ayram puts himself through suffering.
Why are you doing all this?
Says nothing.
Looks to Pella and asks again. 
Why is he doing all this?
A woman.
Ayram spits out out some blood. As if the mere mention of his effervee had driven the spearhead deeper.
Pyetle was stunned. Stunned and disgusted. Not just at the sight of the blood now curdling in the striations of the exposed muscle, but at the thought that any man would do all this for 
“You?” Pyetle asked Pella.
“Goodness no. He is doing this for the First Woman.”
“The First Woman?”
“Ayram is the First Man. Esha’s Man. And Esha was his Woman.”

Ayram blows himself up to save the lives of the Ayramun from the cannibals.
Then they’re chased by empire, Ayram, in his flayed state, saves them again, but at great cost to himself.
Ayram goes into a chamber, or passes out. He’s muscle and sinew. Having just saved the lives the lives of teh Ayramun.
Pella sits the survivors down and is like, look. Ayram needs one you to donate.

Their word for ‘anyone’ means, literally, ‘all the children of noah’. When they want to speak about everyone, no one in particular, they say, ‘all the children of noah’. THat’s how tightly wound their culture is. We just say ‘anyone’. Generic. Bland. Abstract. Practical. They’ve got a whole theology bound up in the word.

Ayram, delerious: “Hushar! Hushar, fetch the chirurgeon!”
“Who is Hushar?”
“Regent Hushar,” Pella said. She pointed to a mural.

About This Template
By default, when compiled (File &gt; Compile), this project will generate a document in the standard manuscript format for novels. The necessary settings are also provided to make it easy to compile to a paperback-style PDF for self-publishing or an EPUB or Kindle e-book.

How To Use This Template
Create a new folder for each chapter and title each folder with the name of the chapter. If you don’t intend to use chapter names, just use something descriptive that tells you what the chapter is about. (You do not need to—and indeed shouldn’t—title the folders “Chapter One” and so on, because chapter numbering will be taken care of automatically during the Compile process.) The first chapter folder has been created for you with the placeholder title “Chapter”.
Create a new text document for each scene inside the chapter folders. (Upon export, scenes will be separated with the “#” character for standard manuscript format, or with a blank line for other formats.)
Information about characters can be placed in the “Characters” folder, and information about locations can be placed in the “Places” folder. (These are just regular folders that have had custom icons assigned to them using the Documents &gt; Change Icon feature.)
Character and setting sketch sheets have been provided for filling out information about the people and places in your novel. These are located in the “Template Sheets” folder. You should not edit the documents in the “Template Sheets” folder directly unless you wish to change the templates (which you are free to do—you may wish to customise the sketch sheets or get rid of them entirely). Instead, to create a new character sheet, click on the Characters folder (or wherever you want to create your new character sheet) and from the Project menu, select New From Template &gt; Character Sketch. This creates a new character sketch document for you to edit and fill in with your character details. You can create setting sketch sheets in the same way.

Compiling
Title pages and front matter are all provided in the “Front Matter” folder (between the “Places” and “Research” folders). You will choose different front matter depending on the format to which you are compiling.
Scrivener remembers your compile settings, so you only need to follow the instructions below when you want to compile to a different format. After that, you can just go to File &gt; Compile… and click the “Compile” button straight away.

To compile to standard manuscript format:
Edit the “Title Page” document inside the Front Matter/Manuscript Format folder to ensure that it contains the correct information. (The &lt;$PROJECTTITLE&gt; and &lt;$fullname&gt; placeholders will be replaced during compile with the information you provide in the Project Properties tab of Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings…, or you can delete them and enter whatever text you like.)
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Standard Manuscript Format” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “Manuscript Format” folder from the menu button next to it (this is already selected by default).
Click “Compile”.

To compile to paperback PDF format:
Edit the front matter pages contained inside the Front Matter/Paperback Novel folder.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “Paperback Novel” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
Ensure that the “Add front matter” button is ticked and select the “Paperback Novel” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected.
Click “Compile”.

To compile to e-book format:
Edit or remove the dedication page contained inside the Front Matter/E-Book folder. Feel free to add any other front matter documents as required.
Import a cover image (the recommended size is 600x800 pixels, preferably in JPG or PNG format). You can store this anywhere, but it makes sense to place it in the “E-Book” front matter folder. A placeholder cover image is already provided—you will want to delete that once you have imported your own.
Go to File &gt; Compile…
Select “E-book (with Parts)” from the “Format As” menu button if it is not already selected.
Expand the window to show all the compile options by clicking the blue arrow button to the right of the “Format As” menu button.
If you have front matter documents other than the cover image, ensure that the “Add front matter” option is ticked and select the “E-Book” folder from the menu button next to it if it is not already selected. If you don’t have any front matter documents, you can un-tick “Add front matter”. (This does not affect the cover image.)
If you have imported your own cover image, be sure to click “Cover” in the left sidebar and select the image from the “Cover Image” menu button.
From the “Compile for” menu button, choose whether to export to EPUB or Kindle format.
Click “Compile”.

Making Changes
There are various minor changes you can make to the settings to tweak this template so that it better suits your needs, as follows:
Project and author name: The default book title and author name used in headers and elsewhere can be customised by going to Project &gt; Meta-Data Settings… and choosing the “Project Properties” tab.
Chapter subtitles: If you don’t want to include the names of your chapter folders below the chapter numbering text in the compiled document, go to the “Formatting” pane in the Compile dialog and deselect “Title” in the list of elements to include.
Page header and footer: You can edit the page header in the “Page Settings” pane of the Compile dialog.
Page size: The “Paperback Novel” format is set to export to a page size of 5.06” x 7.81”, which is one of the formats you can use with CreateSpace. You can customise this by clicking the menu button beside “Paper Size” in the “Page Settings” pane of Compile.
Font: You can use the “Formatting” pane in Compile to change the font used in the final document by selecting a row in the elements table, then clicking into the preview text to select it and clicking the “A” button in the format bar to change the font settings. Note that fonts are not included in e-books, however—e-readers choose their own fonts (and you would need to pay a hefty fee for a licence to embed a particular font in an e-book).
Making your own special folders: The “Characters” and “Places” folders are really just regular folders that have been set up in a particular way, and you are free to create other folders that work in a similar manner.
To create a folder with a custom icon, add a new folder, place it where you want it, ensure it is selected, and then go to Documents &gt; Change Icon to choose a different icon.
To create your own template sheets, simply create a new document inside the “Template Sheets” folder and set it up however you want (whether by adding text, changing the title, setting default meta-data, or whatever). Now this document will be available as the basis of new documents from the New From Template menu. (You can add a custom icon to this if you so wish, too.)
Working with chapters instead of scenes: By default, this project is set up so that you write each scene as a separate text document. If you don’t like to break things up quite that much and would prefer to write an entire chapter in each text document, make the following changes:
Rename the “Scene” document to use your chapter title and move it so that it is on the same level as the “Chapter” folder rather than being inside it.
Move the “Chapter” folder to the Trash.
Create a new text document for each chapter.
In the “Separators” pane of the Compile dialog, change the “Text separator” setting to “Page break”.
If your scene separators are centred (for instance if you are using “#” as the scene separator) and you want them to appear centred in the compiled document, too, select them and choose Format &gt; Formatting &gt; Preserve Formatting.
Everything else: The above constitutes only the most common changes. You can completely change the output format by changing the various settings available in Compile.

Sample Documents
The “Sample Output” folder inside the Research folder contains examples of documents that have been created by compiling from this template. “Standard Manuscript” shows the results when compiling to “Standard Manuscript Format”; “Paperback Novel” shows the results when compiling to “Paperback Novel” format; and “ADE E-book” shows the results when compiling to “E-book” format and opening the resulting EPUB file in Adobe Digital Editions on Windows.

Final Note
Scrivener project templates are flexible and are not intended to restrict you to a particular workflow. You can change, delete or move the files and folders contained in the template, and you can create your own templates by setting up a skeletal project with the files, folders and settings you would like to use for new projects and using File &gt; Save As Template.</Text>

            <Text>, he came at last upon a rocky mountain with a large cave at the foot of it and a large stone over the entrance. After removing the stone and going in, eager to explore the unknown with a human curiosity, he found a spacious chamber, with an opening to the sky above covered over by spreading branches of an ancient palm tree. There was a sparkling spring there, from which a stream overflowed through a little opening, and soaked away into the earth. There were also a few little buildings near the foot of the mountain containing the knives and anvils and mallets used to strike coins; Egyptian writings tell us that this used to be the site of a secret minting factory at the time when Antony and Cleopatra were together.


They ordered another young man in the flower of his youth to be taken into a most pleasant little garden, with white lilies and red roses, and a gentle murmuring stream winding through it, and the wind making a sweet whisper though the leaves of the trees, where they made him lie down on a feather bed, and left him there, tied down with soft silken bonds to prevent him escaping. After they had all gone a beautiful prostitute came in, and began stroking his body in the most delicate of embraces, and, shameful to relate, fondling his manhood in her hands, in the hope of so inciting him to lust that she might win a shameless victory over him. I don't know how this soldier of Christ did it, or how he summoned up his resolve. But will pleasure be the victor where torments fail? For at length, inspired by heaven, he bit off his tongue and spat it in her face as she tried to kiss him. And so the immense pain which followed was stronger than the feeling of lust. 

Pyetle catches up - aryamun are staying back while peeps check it out cause there’s signs of inhabitattion??
OR
Pyetle, come look at this!
“Wanna see a dead body?”

ORRRR











Ayram gives little speech about betrayal or some shit. What will happen to you. 
We all know what punishment for betrayal is. Brought you here to remind you want a heritic/betrayl of the faith gets you. 
YOu all know that I love you, but FEAR OF GOD.
Then does the stabbing example. Puts knife in Sob’s hand. If you should stab him, you must first stab me.
They break down.
Meeting gets interrupted again.
Ayram rushes out to see - Imperials - they haven’t split up. They’ve got to know.
The reason why we split up is because we wanted to see if you were leading them to us.
The rumors of a mind link are true.
How do we prevent it? 
Would Blindfold prevent it? Is it like a homing beacon? How does it work?
It is a being link. We can, with effort, cohabitate. They see what I see, feel what I feel. 
Can you talk to eachother?
Yes.
Then how should we proceed? Kill you is the only way?
Some way of knocking me unconscious.
Elrahet - we have Sel root. Would put him to sleep. If he were human.
Would sel root work?
I am unsure.
Why tell all this? 
You’re barbarians. If I don’t you might do something rash.


Humbling air.


- Pyetle asks about who Ayram is. What’s his deal? I had an experience.
- He’s going to throw the Empire out of the continent.
- I mean what’s his real deal? IN the underworld there was, for a moment I thought he was  demon. I saw things.
- A powerful being, but no, but not a demon.
- Asked Mazydei for his story. ???
- Interrupted by scout - Imperials are on the track - still really far away.
- How the hell! (It’s Mazyd) - we’ve been careful, we’re off the road.
- Double pace to Minting Rock
- “Ah, there it is” - outcrop of rock. Band’s secret minting facility.
- Signs that someone’s been here.
- Hill checks it out. Laughing. Says come on in.
-They stumble on a dried out corpse of a man. It’s an old friar. Must have gotten lost on the Charnel Road or something.
- Relsa, “He’s alive!” “What did he say?” Begone temptress.
- they revive him. See he’s a priest of the dreamer. Pella explains. I was once a priestess. Didn’t know this dude though.
- Hill shows pyetle gold store. Good amount of gold. “Not much of it left”. They put it on the horses and take it away, Pyetle knows not where.
- Pick up water from spring nearby.
- Pella scope sees troops. Mazyd confirms that they’re imperial - they’ve just gotten down into the plain.
-COming right for the rock - interrogate Mazyd - tie up, blindfold, wind, etc. 
- need to change course - lose them in the Sandslants

Anabaptists - martin luther’s reformation hadn’t gone far enough. Luther had settled for superficial changes to the church. Nothing less than a wholesale remaking. Read new testament. Saw that it described the church as a small select group of dedicated believers, surrounded by a hostile pagan world, passionately dedicated to christian living, sharing everything that they owned with eachother, rejoicing in persecution, filled with the power of the holy spirit which manifested itself in visions, prophecies, and miracles, and fired by the expectation of christs immanent return. The compared that vision with the church of their times, and they found it utterly unrecognizable.

Baptism had become corrupt - new testament should be undertaken only by adults as a profession of faith, never by infants or children.  How could you be part of a select few, if you did not choose to join? Baptism is a once in a lifetime event, as unrepeatable as birth itself. Anabaptist baptisms were essentially statements that the whole of christian society were unbaptised heathens.

            <Text>The poet Mandrameen once said that every artist who has tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. For him the problem is always the same: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see - but nothing is more seductive than Nature. Nothing can match it’s grandeur and complexity at scale, for inside every leaf, rock, cloud, and tree are systems within systems, patterns within patterns for as far as it is possible to look. The shock of this beauty goes straight to the spinal cord, and if the mood is right, it hits with an intensity that no poet or painter could hope to achieve.
Mandrameen taught that the Sand focuses this beauty. There the desert heat pulls the mind out from the body, like a cork from a bottle, and if you are left to linger in the sun, near to death, then all desires, plots, and fantasies will evaporate. Nothing is left to support a delicate ego. When Nature’s beauty rushes in it flushes the ego out, it loses it in the wide open spaces of sand and sky. All that’s left for the inner eye to see is the truth about the edge between one’s self and the Universe.
Or so Mandrameen believed. 
It was at least an honest attempt to explain why all religions of the Empire were born in the Sand, and why the beating heart of each of them is the grand city of Jeket, Jewel of the Desert, an oasis in the middle of the world. 
The cynic Seculla took a different view. She claimed that prophets and messiahs flock to the Sand - and Jeket in particular - because gold flows through it. The stuff filters into the city from mines in the interior, and once the cut is taken, it leaves down river then out to sea towards Carcina, the Empire’s capital. 
Whether or not this is true is a matter of taste. But it cannot be denied that, for many folk, gold is more tempting than eternal salvation. After all, gold is just as bright and as immutable as the Divine, but you can touch it. If a pure, soft, sparkling spot of it gets into your hands you’ll be struck with a yearning akin to spiritual rapture, a yearning for more of it, for as much as you can get. The more enterprising religions channel this effect by casting the gold into idols. They pour it into molds and curse-pots, and they use it to ornament their sacred texts and the walls of their heavenly dwellings. The way that gold scintillates in the candlelight of a dark and cloistered room creates an impression of holiness that is strong enough to lure even the weakest pilgrims out to shrines nestled deep in the Sand. In such hallowed places, the chosen few may hear whispered invitations leap out of the rock, or out of the sand or sky, but godless folk claim that its just the whisperings of the gold, for they hear it too. They can hear it even while it sits in the ground, and like pious men they devote their lives to the call. 
The only person on the Earth who worshiped neither the Gods , and neither the Gold, was Ayram. He was religious in his own way, a thief of a kind, but chiefly he was known as Evil, and he was simply too skilled to ever be captured. 
Pella would say, “Too cautious to be captured”, and as the eldest of Ayram’s band that was how she liked it. She was sensitive to the risks that younger folk were willing to take, for she had made many of them herself - her fake brass nose could attest to that. For Pella, it was a reminder of her duty to preach caution and steer the young pups away from prey that fights back. This imperative dwelled deep in her old arthritic bones, for they would get to tingling whenever danger was near, just as they were tingling now.
“This doesn’t seem right,” she grumbled to Ayram. Her voice hoarse and scratchy from years of freeweed abuse. She peered through the lens of her scopic copper tube which was balanced upon a stick. From her perch high in the strata of a sandstone cliff, she could pick out the riders of a distant merchant caravan, and could count their number all the way back to the rear of their column. 
“Seventy-two... and there’s something unnatural about them,” Pella said.  “I don’t think we should go for it.”
Ayram was standing next to her, taller by at least three feet. He was a giant of a man but skinny, and all his limbs were wrapped tight in wool and leather as if to accentuate his ganglyness.
He was stroking his scraggly beard as he tracked Pella’s gaze.
“What do you mean ‘something unnatural’?” he asked.  
With his vision unaided, Ayram could only make out the dust cloud kicked up by the distant caravan - it billowed high into the air and shone brightly as the early morning light picked it out against the darker blue of the fleeing night sky. 
“There’s an odd fix about them.” Pella said.
“An odd fix? You’ve counted seventy-two. That’s exactly how many Salavan said there’d be, and they’re coming along at exactly the right time and place.”
“I don’t doubt your man in Jeket. But still, something is off.”
Ayram kept silent to give Pella time to study their quarry. It would be stupid to ignore the mood of a woman whose misgivings had saved them several times before.
“It’s the way they ride,” Pella concluded. She moved aside to let Ayram peer through the scope. “Have you ever seen a caravan guard ride three by three like that?” she asked. 
Ayram bent down on one knee and put his eye to the rim of the brass eyepiece. The wagons and their guard quickly came into focus.
“No,” he replied. 
“I don’t think we should go for it,” Pella repeated.
Ayram shrugged her off and took a moment to absorb the details. 
There were eight wagons, several more than the average for a gold train, and the tight discipline of the riders made it easy to count their number; three by three as Pella had said. Hardly the ragged band of backwash from the Empire’s conquests that passed for caravan hands this far out in the Sand. Ayram couldn’t make out any insignia or marks that might identify them as professional soldiers. Still, they were quite far out on the Junei plain, and Pella’s old scope was a little dusty. 
Ayram compared what he saw to the lay of the ambush that he had set up below. It seemed the most ideal spot to bushwhack such a heavily guarded merchant caravan. It was one of the few short and straight ravines through which a road actually passed. Its slopes were steep so his people would have a clean shot at the whole column, provided all seventy-two and all eight wagons could fit inside. Though there were few trees, there were plenty of boulders and prickly brown bushes for cover. The way out of the ravine was easy enough to manage with caltrops buried in the sand. They had even bolted in an iron trip-line to prevent a retreat.
Against fearful men, it would be a slaughter. 
Against experienced warriors, Ayram was not so sure.
“If they weren’t wearing that woolen garb I’d take them for Imperial cavalry,” Ayram said.
“It could be that they’ve been drilling common hands,” Pella suggested.
“That could be.”
“Or, it could be that those really are Imperial riders.”
“But they’re wrapped in white wool.”
“Sure, sure. But I’m wrapped in wool and I’m Imperial. Used to be anyways,” Pella said.
“An Imperial priestess, not an officer,” Ayram corrected. “Officers don’t drop their company’s colors for convenience. Even in the desert.”
Pella laughed. “The Sand makes converts of us all, Ayram. Uniforms be damned.” At that she spit off the side of the cliff and watched it fall. It swayed a little in the cool breeze and landed fifty yards below, where the boy Sendren was stringing his helmwood bow. Sendren looked up at Pella and muttered a curse, but Pella just shook her head and pointed up above her, innocently directing Sendren’s ire towards Relsa who was perched atop the cliff.
“The point of a uniform isn’t comfort,” Ayram said. “For them it’s hardly even for protection.  It’s about distinction.” 
“Sure, sure. But still,” Pella said.
“Yes,” Ayram relented, “they could be fighting men.”
“They could be rabble, they could be Imperials. Would it change your call?” Pella asked, thinking she knew the answer.
“If they are Imperial then they’ll have skin in the game.”
“They won’t run when the killing starts,” Pella said, finishing his thought.
“And the way we’re set up -”
“This only works if they try to run.”
“It’s only completely safe if they run.” 
“So it’s off then.”
Ayram took a moment once more to eye the caravan through Pella’s scope, trying to find some detail that might still swing his decision. 
The information he’d been given by Salavan was accurate - the caravan was here as predicted. He and his people were eager, rested, and ready. Smooth sandstone boulders were levered. The long shadows of the rising sun would keep them hidden until the most opportune moment. There was even the off chance that the witch’s magic might work. Most importantly, their secret way into and out of the ravine was a hidden crevasse which remained unknown to the Empire, and every day that Ayram delayed he risked its discovery. If found, this stretch of the Junei would be closed to him forever.
“Disciplined riders aren’t enough to call this off,” Ayram finally decided, and handed the glass back to Pella. 
“Then should I whistle the boys?” Pella asked, looking a little grim. It was a look which came quite easy for her.
“Yes,” Ayram replied. “Be sure to stab and flutter it. We need a little extra caution.”
 Pella nodded, then put her hands to her mouth and whistled the song of the Jade Tresset to let the men know that the ambush was on. She stabbed and fluttered the high notes, as Ayram had directed.
Ayram waited a bit for twittered replies to spring from his people’s hiding spots, and then he squeezed his giant frame into the little cave behind him.
Cloistered within the cramped cave was the witch Elrahet. She was an older woman, ten years younger than Pella, although a specific age was rarely a thing ascribed to people of the Sand. Like Ayram, she was Jandrian, and all Jandrians seemed to foreigners like they had been quarried fully formed out of the earth. Their features were as dark, hard, and solemn as any slab of Melthasite ore. Their sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the bark of any pepperwood tree.  Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the sizable horned lizard over whose corpse she squatted.
The beast was belly up, and her fingers were knuckle deep in it’s guts, twisting and twirling as her lips whispered incantations and her eyes searched the pink sliver of morning sky that peeked through the crack in the rocks above.
“It’s almost time,” Ayram warned.
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, though she did not take her eyes off the sky, nor her hand from the lizard’s corpse.
“What thing is more vital than blood?” she asked the world. 
“Blood cold as ice…” 
She pushed down with the palm of her hand to squeeze acids out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Blood hot as a raging fire….” 
She squeezed the intestinal organs with her knotted fingers. 
“We would be gods if not for blood…”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up.
“We would be dust without it.” 
Elrahet threw the entrails down, back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within.
When nothing happened, she snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s belly wider. Into the hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, then pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin.
The lizard’s belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Ayram supposed that the thing was somehow still alive. When Elrahet finally pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh, it went completely limp.
“It is possible,” Elrahet said to Ayram in a quiet whisper so that none outside could hear, “that the beast is infertile.” 
“So this won’t work?” Ayram knelt across from her.
“Not with this beast.”
Ayram spread apart the lizard’s corpse. He could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-grey intestines writhed and pulsed like a knotted mass of worms. 
He was impressed.
“Well... it was worth a try,” he said.
Elrahet hissed at his dubiety. “I just need fertile blood. Fresh fertile blood,” she stressed.
Ayram thought for a moment, then pulled up his sleeve and extended his hairy brown arm towards Elrahet.
“Your blood? I won’t carve you open,” Elrahet croaked. “Get me one of the Pazard boys or something.”
“There’s no time. It’s either me or Pella... Or no one.” 
“That old Imperial sow isn’t fertile.”
“Well then,” Ayram said, extending his arm further.
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given by one Jandrian to another. Elrahet had been Ayram’s witch for years and he had never offered a drop. She tried to gauge his countenance to see if he was sincere - but his face was set deep in the shadow of his hood and his eyes were sunk back behind bushy brows. His beard hid whatever slight expression his lips might reveal. Even clean shaven and in direct light, the difference between his smile and a frown was almost imperceptible. 
She looked down at his arm and eyed the veins that bulged under the skin. She knew his blood would be potent. 
“We can do this without you,” Ayram said with more than a hint of impatience.
At that, Elrahet pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from her bag and laid them between herself and Ayram. Then she unsheathed a patterned blade from her belt and held it’s curve length-wise to Ayram’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said.
“And I yours,” Ayram replied. 
Elrahet savored his courtesy with a near-toothless grin, then eagerly plunged her dagger’s tip into his flesh. She flicked her wrist with expert care and opened the vein. Ayram remained unstirred, watching with serious intent as blood bubbled out of the wound and ran around his wrist in a steady stream to drip into the bowl.
 When he had enough, he jerked his arm free.
“That’s it.” He said. 
The bowl was just half full.
“Your gift is humbling, but if that is it… don’t expect much,” Elrahet grumbled.
“I did say that we can do this without you.”
Elrahet scowled, then took the bowl and began to flick Ayram’s blood onto the lizard’s corpse, careful to make sure that not a drop hit the dirt.
Ayram took the yard of linen to dress his wound. As he tried to maneuver his hips round so he could leave, he bumped Elrahet. 
“Get out of here!” she snapped. 
Ayram laughed as he did.

Maybe do short desc. Of the ravine here.

The first signs of Elrahet’s magic were the wispy vapor trails that circulated high in the atmosphere above her cave. They twirled and danced, driven by unnatural purpose, though they were so slight that they could hardly be said to be there at all. By the time Ayram sat down at his hiding spot behind a couple of small boulders on the northern slope of the ravine, the trails had begun to congeal into something thicker.
Soon the wind picked up and began to brush them into form, and it blew a pleasant musk of earthy, humid air down into the ravine. If Ayram had not been looking for it, he might not have noticed how a light fog subtly shifting into existence. Just as he began to wonder if the crew had taken notice, a low rolling drum of distant thunder echoed through the valley, though there was, as yet, no great storm from which it could have come.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” said Papillian excitedly. The boy was stationed behind a boulder closer to the road. Ayram glared down at him with sufficient sternness to shush him. He didn’t blame the lad for the outburst as this was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of magic.
It was perhaps too good. The merchant caravan was still far out. Perhaps they had not yet made it into the valley’s fingers. Perhaps they could see the cyclonic flow of haze that now swirled above Elrahet’s cave. Still, Ayram half expected that it all might fizzle out - humans made for poor magicians - but all his doubts were allayed when dense clouds began to creep out from some invisible fissure in the sky.
They crept out slowly, like cautious cattle out of the pen. Once they were out over the ravine they began to feed, to chew and swallow the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of the lizard that Elrahet had prepared. 
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, just little pricklings on the skin, just a light peppering of the sandy rocks and clay. The drizzle cleansed the air of the desert dust that was ever present in the Sand, the stuff that clogged the nose and scratched the throat. In fact the air was so crisp that this was the first time in forever that Ayram could take in a full, clean breath. It was a tranquil moment, but short lived, for minute by minute the wind swelled and the rain thickened and the storm above ballooned into a supercell the size of several mountains. Lightning flashed and thrashed around in the belly of the beast above, banging the drum of thunder.
More and more the rain began to pour. Without shelter it seemed like torture. The short and woody weeds that had managed to scrape out an existence in the ravine were whipped to and fro as the wind and rain stripped leaf from stem. It came down hard and wet on the men as well. Ayram found little comfort in the fact that he had his back to it all.  
At least the earth seemed to enjoy it, parched and desiccated as it was. It took its time to drink its fill. It filtered the water through sand and silt and then trickled it down into the deep reservoirs of the world. It savoured every drop, and it drank slowly, which meant that it did not take long for the surface to become soaked. Soon rain began to pitter-patter into puddles, and water ran down the ravine, seeking out the familiar routes that it had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millenia. Where once there were cracks, pits, and sinks in the rock and clay, there were now streams and cascades. Where once there were depressions and scars, there were now pools in which desert life would find succor.
Ayram looked over to the young Papillian. Though the rain was rare and precious on this side of the Junei Mountains, the boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers. He might as well have been swimming. 
He muttered a curse, and the storm cursed back.


CRACK-BOOM!


A bright and gnarled flash of lightning split the dark sky above. 
It hit somewhere near in the cliffs behind them.
Everyone jumped.
“Elra’s never conjured more than foggy mist!” Papillian exclaimed.
Colm, a beastly man to Papillian’s side could be heard as well. “Bit much innit?”
Ayram disagreed.  By this point the valley road was getting good and slick and muddy. Laden wagons would have to be dragged through it. They would be moving slowly, if they would move at all - though that was cause for some concern. They might not even make it into the ravine. Or, they might have turned around and fled the valley as soon as the first showers hit them.
 Then a faint horse’s whinny pierced the splashing of the rain. 
Ayram turned his gaze southward. There he could just make out the shapes of white horses coming round the bend. Their riders were hunched in their saddles, sore backs and sore nerves all around. Their horses moved slowly, leaning into the deluge. Ayram could almost feel the mud draining their already tired legs of vigor. He smiled when he saw one stumble and throw its rider into a growing rivulet.
Nonetheless they all plodded onward, heads down against the pelting rain, filtering into the ravine three by three. Their wagons were faring as Ayram expected, with drivers working hard to steady the mood of the mule-teams that had grown discontent with the whole situation. If the mules had been men they would have taken up arms long ago in a suicidal bid for freedom. As beasts, all they could do was scream through their suffering and sway against the strain and slip in the viscous mud.
Ayram would have been perfectly pleased if he hadn’t noticed the olive skin and tufts of blackred hair peeking out from under the soldiers’ turbans. They were each, to a man, Roman[a]. This was indeed a company of Imperial Cavalry. Then he caught sight of the wooden septum piercings that popped out of their noses like bull horns. These were men of the Hallowed Guard- the absolute elite.
Ayram's pulse quickened, and he could feel his nerves tighten as he peered out at them from behind his rock. Just a few sheets of rain separated him from this pride of lions - to be this close was suicide. Even though all smells were driven down into the earth, and all edges and colors were blurred, and all sounds below a shout were drowned out by the torrential downpour, Ayram felt like they could sense him. Such is the case when a predator hunts a predator; they have little familiarity, little tolerance for doubt and fear. It does not take much of that drug to overwhelm them.
By the time the middle of column had reached Ayram’s position, he had steadied his nerve. He then leaned out from behind his rock, aimed his bow towards one of their number, notched an arrow, and let it fly.
In clean, dry air his gull-feather arrow would trill with excitement when released, but so wetted by the rain it simply jumped from the waxed string of his bow. So quiet and obscured was its flight, and so loud was the wind and rain, that even after it struck its target and sank him low in his saddle, the caravan remained oblivious to the danger.
 The dead rider’s horse took a few steps, then the body slipped from its perch and fell into the mud. 
So began the battle.
Cries of horse and rider flew as a hail of arrows leapt from the slopes of the ravine, planting themselves in throats and ribs. Some bounced off armor or missed their marks all together and fell into the mud. Even Ayram had trouble in these tight quarters, for the wind and rain was so strong that they carried his arrows unpredictably; just a meter was enough to spare or doom a life. 
Hardly a third of the riders were stricken in the first few volleys. For a company of Hallowed Guardsmen, the bodycount was no convincing argument for retreat.
 An officer’s horn sounded. It bellowed then sank into a deep register that rumbled the streams and puddles that already ran red with blood. Those riders which had not already dismounted did, and they pulled their heater shields from off their horses' packs, then rushed to form up a defensive shape centered in the ravine just below Ayram. Here and there one of them would shudder then fall to his knees as an arrow snuck through the wall of shields, his hands clutching wherever his flesh was pierced. His compatriots would kick him out of the circle and down into the mud, then close ranks behind him. 
They moved and thought as one, and like a leaf-scaled wyrm caught out in the open Sand by a falcon, they curled and curled again.
Ayram eyed them warily, wondering what they could possibly do to prevent his party’s arrows from whittling them down one by one.
Then a man amongst them broke rank stepped forward. He seemed misshapen, and was bare and bald, and his sleeves were rolled up to reveal an intricate tattoo that weaved round his wrists and up his arms. 
Then his hands began to glow.
Ayram notched an arrow and aimed for the man’s neck, so that he might stifle the power that he channeled in those arms and that he brewed in those lungs. 
Before he could let it fly, the storm intervened. 


CRACK-BOOM!


A bolt of lighting shot down from the high icy reaches of the thunderhead. It struck the middle of the road with an incredible ferocity, and as it did it seemed to explode, throwing wind, rain, and flesh in all directions. The shockwave threw Ayram back against the rocks of the ravine, and there was a muted thwack as his skull hit the broad face of a sandstone boulder. 
Then things went black.
        
_______


        Getting your skull caved in is the worst way to lose track of time. Next worst is a night of fitful sleep, but of course that doesn’t compare. Sleep can be said to be a lived experience inasmuch as one’s dreams are remembered.  Even without them, the passage of time is always somehow estimated so that as soon as you step out of bed there is that sublime sensation of being reinserted into the natural flow of things - not so with a knockout blow.
More to the point, there’s the pain.
        When Ayram came to, there was a dull, throbbing ache that radiated out from the top of his head where the rock had cracked open his skull. He brought his hand up to the wound and dabbed it gingerly with his fingers. They trembled upon a smattering of dried blood which had matted his hair. He then continued to follow the pain to its source, near the crown of his skull. There he found that he could push down on a flap of skin and a cracked bit of bone. As he traced the outline of the cavity, a sharp pain shot out and ran around to the back of his head, constricting his skull like a python. 
        He must have been out for hours. Maybe days. He had no way of knowing 
Oddly, it was still raining.
        “You’re awake!”
        It was old Pella. She rushed to his side.
        “We were set up!” she said.
        “What?” Ayram asked, confused even as to how he was alive.
“It was a setup! There was no gold!” Her raspy voice was quivering with excitement and rage.
Ayram tried to blink the blur out of his vision. He was in a cave somewhere high in the mountains.
“How long was I out?”, he asked.
“For the better part of a day… There was no gold, Ayram.” 
Ayram winced, half in pain, half in exasperation.
“What happened?” he asked.
“That storm that Elrahet magic’d up conjured a bolt… bigger than any I’ve ever seen... it took out the entire caravan. It took out Papillian and Colm, too, and nearly you. But that magus survived!” Pella pointed to the naked figure who lay crumpled and unconscious near the cave’s mouth. His pale body was covered in black glyphs and arcane symbols. Blood pooled around him.
“He has not yet awoken. I haven’t told the boys yet, but he’s no mere magus. We cut
off his hands… I think he’s one of the Emperor’s Salisians,” Pella said. “Only four Salisians in the world, and one of them is here... He was here to kill us! Ayram, we were set up!”
Ayram struggled to take it all in.
“Who was your man in Jeket?!” Pella asked, stressing the urgency of the moment. 
“Who baited us into this?”
Ayram closed his eyes and gritted his teeth.
“A man named Salavan Saran.”

            <Title>Setting Out</Title>
            <Text>
	The Sand is webbed by a network of byways that are hardly there at all. They’re not well traveled, and most are so windswept that footprints get filled back up with sand as soon as they’ve been made. These roads are only distinguished from the desert landscape by a series of five-ton waystones that stick up three meters out of the ground. If those gleaming white beams of rock weren’t there every league or so, you’d never know that under your feet was an ancient Jandrian route. 
	Pilgrims call them Charnel Roads because unlike the highways which keep to the river banks or hop between oases, these roads cut through the vast shadeless expanse of the Sand, leaving travelers exposed to the deadly sun, wind, and the glare of the desert. The longer the road the deadlier it all is, though that’s just a rule of thumb because the worst Charnel Road, the Bazul Road, is one of the shortest. It sits just north of Uncharted Portion where an ancient mountain range once stood. An eon of blasting sand had reduced those mountains to a rolling line of graveled hills, flat enough for the Bazul Road to snake up and down them, flat enough for old pilgrims to make the journey to the greater shrine of Bazul. It only takes a full day to make the road if you start at the nearest Imperial outpost at Shahiz, but its such a difficult hike, and Pilgrims sweat so much from the effort that the heat on top of it is unbearable. And it’s a saturating heat, too, because the chalky gravel underfoot is white as bone, meaning it throws the sunlight right back up into the face. You get baked from below as much as from above. You can’t even hide in your own shadow.
 	There is only one little bit of shade on route: a little wood-frame waystation at a saddlepoint. The monks of Bazul keep it stocked with a cache of water buried in jugs. Some pilgrims sleep there in the day and make the road at night, skipping the sun altogether, but Solitant pilgrims don’t use it. They don’t trivialize the journey. They set out for the shrine in the morning and trudge through the brunt of it at midday. They do it, they say, because if Bazul did not intend for them to suffer, he would have set his earthly dwelling down on some oated knoll at the mouth of a Jeketian inlet. No, Bazul’s road was there in the Sand because Bazul put it there, and to skip this test of faith against flesh is to have no faith at all. This is the first lesson the road teaches the Solitant: the greatest temptation one must fight is the temptation to not try at all.
	Once a pilgrim actually gets on the road the temptations start to give way to the struggle. There are still a few urges to deal with, a few spiritual lessons learn. For example, there’s urge to stop and sit, to rest. Anywhere else in the world it would be a fine thing to do, but sitting down on a Charnel Road without shade is a mistake because the sun still bakes you even if you’re not moving. It will bake you tomorrow, too, so don’t saddle tomorrow’s self with today’s journey.
	Solitants savor this particular ordeal because it highlights two important lessons: doom finds you much quicker than death, and doing nothing is the same as doing the wrong thing. Nowhere else in the world are these principles so clear. Out on a Charnel Road, a man, sitting down, with no aches or pains and a full waterskin, is still moving towards the point of no return. This is the the inescapable consequence of Time: inaction is action itself, and for the Solitant, it is a refusal of the Divine gift of Will. 
	It is important to note that the Solitant word for doomed is ‘Shiskason’, and it doesn’t mean ‘doomed’ exactly. Unlike ‘doomed’ it carries an air of blame, not fate. It reads roughly like, ‘thing-that-you-did-not-prevent’. This gets to the heart of the Solitant religion: all creatures are naturally immortal, but every creature dies because every uncouth mistake ages the soul, every missed opportunity for righteousness draws another line in the face. If only people made the right decisions at every step they would live forever, but we’re all too ignorant, too dumb, and too lazy, so the weight of our failures literally kill us. Here, a pilgrim becomes a Shiska for no other reason than he stopped and he sat and he did not walk the road.
	 This cosmology is woven into the Solitant’s yellow haircloth habit. The constant itch is a constant reminder to never waste time. It keeps one alert and attentive to even the smallest opportunity to exercise Will. Of course, this creates another temptation pilgrims must fight on the Charnel Roads: the temptation to cast the scratchy habit aside. Not only does it itch, but the heat gets underneath it. The urge to take it off, to get the heat out and let the sweaty skin breathe is ever present. It’s here that the body starts to bargain with the mind, “Just take it off for a little while,” it pleads. “No one is watching. No one would know.” Pilgrims don’t ever do it, though. It’s a familiar temptation. Not only would they be casting aside their symbol of devotion, they’d actually be making it easer for the sun to sap their bodies of moisture and energy. 
	Its not the temptations, its the physical struggle that does most pilgrims in. On the Bazul road a twisted ankle or a tweaked knee is all but inevitable. Man’s upright gait just isn’t designed for a sustained trudge uphill through loosely packed gravel. No pilgrim has ever made the journey without stumbling a time or two, and when they fall their hands and feet get cut because the gravel isn’t smooth like riverstone, it’s been chipped unevenly by the wind and the sand. It’s got points and edges, some as sharp as blades.
	Solitant monks are used to fighting through physical pain, but nonetheless, it slows them down and gives the sun time to work delirium into them. At that point if they make a mistake with water, they’re dead, and it’s an easy mistake to make for any Solitants that come from across the northern sea. They don’t know what the sun can do to a body with just a few hours. When these foreigners come to the Bazul Road, all they hear is that its only a days journey. One day’s journey. Only twenty leagues. Sure, they hear stories about the deaths, but they shrug them off because such stories are never accurate. Carnage is always embellished. Three water-skins should be enough. 
	It’s hard to get experience traveling in the Sand, because getting experience means you’ve got to survive your mistakes. The first time a person pricks her water-skin on the half-buried thorn of a karkel-bush seed pod is the last time. There’s just no room for error, and dying in the Sand isn’t a pleasant way to go. If the heat takes you quick its not so bad, but if it doesn’t, if you’ve rationed water well enough to die slowly, then your mouth dries out and your tongue swells up and your eyes lose their moisture and start to scratch. Then a thumping nausea works its way out from your head and into your stomach and then into your marrow’s jelly. It’s no coincidence that almost every corpse found on a Charnel Road is found curled up like fetus against the agony, though not many corpses are found because a pack of lizards can eat a full adult male in a just few hands, and when you’re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you might still be alive when they do it.
Maybe Pyetle is in a trance-like state. Coming out of it.

Transition to Pyetle waking up to being dragged along in a makeshift sled on a charnel road?
Convo with Mandrameen.
There’s a smaller skinny dude who is dumb as fuck. Mazyd.

Absolute huge-ass brute.
Moteah is like, nope don’t talk about it.
“But I got to know”
“Between you and Ayram.”
“I had visions.”
“We all did.”
“Does everyone see the same thing?”
“Don’t think so. But it’s not something we talk about.”
“The one thing that’s the same is that everyone feels differet. You get urges to do things you wouldn’t normally do. Maybe its confidence.”


Pyetle looked behind them, and say that Mazyd was struggling along. “What about Mazyd?” he asked.
 “The Seilsi?”
“Yeah.”
“What about him?”
“Well, Urghiz is a long way off.

“Yeah.”
 “He’s in pretty bad shape. You think he’s going to make it?”
“Shit, I don’t know if you gonna to make it.” Moteah looked Pyetle up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness. “You don’t know how bad it is out there. It’s not just the heat.”
“I’ve been on caravans.”
“We ain’t keep to the roads.”
“Well if you’re concerned about me, then how is he gonna make it?” Pyetle asked, nodding in Mazyd’s direction. Moteah stopped him, and looked in his eyes with intent.
“Pye, I’m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.”
Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi, and there was no telling what he was capable of. There were rumors that Seilsi had strange biologies, but these rumors always conflicted, so Pyetle never gave them credence. One day a man would claim he saw a Seilsi jump over a crowd just because he could, while another would say he saw a Seilsi struggle to get up into a saddle. Some said they could see through walls, others said they were nearly blind.
There was a lot unusual about Mazyd’s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.
Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. 
“I could help with the Seilsi,” Pyetle suggested.
“Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.”
“I am worrying about myself. I’m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that’s something I could do.” 
Moteah rolled her eyes. “I’ll ask Pella about it.” She turned back to the course and trudged along. “Come on, we almost there.” 


“Do you mind if I sit with you?” Mandrameen asked. “I’d like to ask you some questions.”
“Sure. Of course.” Pyetle replied. Mandrameen was smiling and so he smiled back. thought how strange it was that despite his great depression, his sociability bubbled up nonetheless.
“Normally we’re a friendlier bunch, but recent events have been stressful,” Mandrameen said.
“Oh it’s no worry.”
“I hear things are all very fresh for you as well.”
“Fresh?” Pyetle asked.
“Fresh memories,” Mandrameen clarified. “I like to get at them while they’re fresh.” Mandrameen reached into his leather pack and pulled out a folded ream of paper. 
Pyetle looked on in confusion. He’d hardly expected to see a lad with so much paper here amongst the Ayramun. But the boy did have a scholarly look about him. 
Mandrameen unfolded a page and tried to iron out the crease with the palm of his hand. “Memories are worst when they’re fresh,” he said. “They’re more complete, sure, and that’s why I want to get you aside right now, but they’ve got none of the weight or the clarity of a long-treasured tale. Still, I want to get it fresh because, you know. So let’s just focus on the details, we’ll leave the flavor for when you’ve had time to stew.”
“I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re getting at. ”
“I want to know how Ayram found you.”

Pyetle looked at Mandrameen through squinted eyes. He had no idea what the young man was on about. Mandri pulled out a scrap of paper and bit charcoal from his bag.
“Pyetle, pyetle. Family name?”
“Pyetle Andramawmun.”
“Jandrian? I guess I can see it. Father Jandrian, Mother from -”
“Mother’s family from Carcina.”
“From the Capitol? Interesting. How did she get - well that’s for later. Right now its the fresh memories I want. How are you feeling right now?”
“I’m warming up.”
“I mean mentally, what’s your mood. Where are you at right now?”
“My mood? I don’t know. Confused.”
“Confused, yes. Yes, that’s it. So how did Ayram find you?”
“Ayram? Well… I wouldn’t say he found me. It was all just a kind of coincidence.”
“It wasn’t a coincidence.”
“He was looking for someone else and I just happened to be there, so-”
“There’s no such thing as coincidence.”
Pyetle chuckled and said, “You know, the Seilsi told me just the same not too long ago.”
“Did he? He’s right. With Ayram, at least, there’s no such thing as coincidence. So tell me how it happened.”
“I’d rather not. It’s not my brightest moment.”
“I didn’t expect it would be. Ayram found me in a gully. I was half-dead. I was trying to kill myself.”
“Oh? How were you p ”


Everyone stops. Half splitting off.
Don’t like stopping but ok.
Mazyd needs to stop. Pyetle too - put bandage on feet to prevent blisters.

Bullo 
“So, you’ve got to get thinking about it. When you don’t have the time to work hard, you’ve got to work smart. So let’s get you thinking about it. First, you got to define your goal. What is your goal in a fight with blades?”
“Survive.”
“Hah! Good! That’s right! Usually folk say its to kill your opponent, but that excludes a perfectly viable strategy in any fight: running away.”
“I can do that.”
“Right! You should always run away, if you can. I’m not just saying that because you’re inexperienced. If you pulled a blade on me, I’d run away. If it came to blows I’d kill you a hundred times out of a hundred, if it came to it, but I’d still prefer run away.” 
“Why?”
“Because swords are sharp, Pyetle. You ever been cut? I mean really cut. Doesn’t take much for a blade like that to find the bone.”
“But you said that -“
“Yes, I said a hundred times out of a hundred. But a thousand times? A hundred thousand? You’d get lucky in a few of those. The point is that there’s always risk and it’s never worth taking if you can just, simply, run away. I’ve seen men as skilled as the caliphants of legend get stabbed in the belly by raw recruits. It just happens sometimes. Especially when you’re getting long in the tooth. You understand, eh? Can’t get away with things you used to.”
“Believe me, I don’t need lessons in running away.”
Bullo chuckled.
“Sure. Sure. So, in the event you can’t run away, the goal becomes clearer than simply surviving.”
“Kill you before you kill me.”
“You could settle for incapacitate.”
“Suppose I could.”
“A lot of killing blows don’t kill quickly. There’s a few reliable spots. The heart,” He pounded his chest. “And the head.” He tapped his skull. “Of course you’ve got to consider armor in all this. It’s why Imperial Socars wear breastplates and helmets and not much else. Commissars will say that the reason they don’t outfit the troops with more protection is because there’s not enough iron to go around, but really it’s just because the Empire can afford one to one trades. When a Socar’s life gets cut down to minutes, he’s taught to spend them with reckless abandon, to do whatever he can to make sure the enemy whose blade is stuck in his belly goes down with him. You might not believe it, but they’ve got a whole discipline that teaches them how, if you get struck down this way or that, sword or spear, what’s the best thing to do to get ‘em back.” The Empire can afford to think like that. They can afford one-for-one trades.”
“But Jandrians are mostly known for slings and arrows. .”
“Pyetle, they can afford twenty-for-one trades. That, and they’ve got these things called shields…”
“Right.”
“Anyways, the point is, if the goal is to incapacitate…. Well if we had more time we’d get into taking what they give you. Every style and stance is presenting something as a target. But for now let’s just say our target is the sword arm. Generally speaking, its the closest part of the enemy to your blade, and if struck, the threat is nullified. There’s three parts: shoulder, arm, and hand.” He tapped each part as he was wont to do.
“The hand is simple. It’s basically just a bundle tendon, muscle, and bone. If it gets cut anywhere, prettymuch, then the hand goes to shit. If I can’t grip my sword, you win.”
Pyetle nodded. 
“The hard part about the hand, is that its a small target that moves quickly. The shoulder however, is tied to the body’s core, and moves slowly. If I hack your shoulder here,” He patted the meat of Pyetle shoulder, “You won’t drop your sword, but you won’t be able to raise it. You’ll still be able to stab with it, but swinging is out of the question. So remember that. Hit the shoulder and he can still stab. Of course, if you get lucky and sever the nerve here, then the whole arm goes to shit.”
“I’d be lucky just to land a blow.”
“Sure, sure. I know this is a lot to take in, but these things need to be rolling around in your brain. When the time comes, you’ll see, the mind has a way of digging these things up. Just remember the key things at least: Sword arm,” he patted his own right arm. “Fast but near,” he held up his hand. “Slow but far.” He held the shoulder.
“Now, before we get into the technical side of attacking these points, we’ve got to touch a bit on the art of swordplay.”
“Never thought there was anything artful about killing. Brutal business.”
“When I say art, I mean a way of thinking about solving problems. It’s something all the arts share. They all take one fundamental thing, like in music its a single note, in painting its a single brushstroke - they take this one thing, and they put a bunch of them together to form a more complex whole. In swordplay it’s no different. I’m sure you’ve heard it’s like dance because it is like dance - it’s using the same fundamental stuff to compose its many forms: and that’s the human body. When it comes down to it, swordplay, and fighting in general, well of course they’re artforms. They’re a genres of dance.”
“I don’t understand.”
“You don’t need to. You just need to be thinking about it like this - and I’ll use music as an example because it’s familiar to everyone - music has certain aspects to it which the musician needs to be aware of if he wants to be a competent musician. There is melody, harmony rhythm, texture, how loud or soft it is. Every single note is affect all of this aspects of the song simultaneously. That’s the important thing. If you want to compose a song, you need to be thinking about how the next not you place is going to affect not just the melody, but also the harmony, the rhythm, the texture, the loudness, and more.”
“Again, it’s the same with all art forms. You paint a painting, with every single brushstroke, you’re making a statement about color, about edge, about value, and more. So if you’re a painter you need to be aware of those aspects. Every single brushtroke you make affects everything simultaneously.”
“So what’s the fundamental stuff in swordplay.”
“Its the human body. Well, the body and the sword as one.”
“No, what are the, uh , If music has harmony and melody and whatnot -“
“Yes. Yes. what are the component parts of a duel? It’s these: distance, timing, balance, risk, sequence, and most importantly, the opposition.”
“I see.”
“Every movement you make affects all of these things simultaneously. I take a step towards you, and I am changing the distance. I am playing with risk. I have changed my center of balance. I am setting up a sequence, because with this step, whatever actions come next must flow from it, and then most importantly, of course, is what you, the opposition, does in turn.”
“You can’t possibly be thinking about all these things. Not in the middle of a duel. There’s no time.”
“These and more. Really theres no end to the aspects of any art, because after all, it’s all made up. Just stick with the basics, drill them, and you’ll be competent enough to hold your own.”
“Can’t you just show me a few moves?”
“It’s an art, Pyetle.”
“An art? I’m not trying to express myself here. My aim is to survive.”
“I know. But ‘a few moves’ aren’t going to keep you alive. You need to be able to react to whatever is going on. To do that you need to be able to solve novel problems. Creativity, Pyetle. Creativity is what will keep you alive. To be creative, you need to be thinking critically about what it is you’re doing. That’s what art is, that is what fighting is; creative problem solving. You need to be thinking this way and so we’ll practice it. Now stand up.”







“ , you’ve won if you can bring your blade to a narrower angle than the opponent. Because that means you’ve got a quicker path to the belly. 
So, let’s just stand here , sword to sword. 
Pytele copies the pose
So here, we’re even. Now if I pull my sword to swing, you’re winning. One step and stab and I’m dead. If I take a step back, and out of your range, it doesn’t matter. This is the first beginner lesson: you start the swing out of range, finish it in range. If you’re going to give the opponent the angle advantage, then stay out of range. Like so
Alright, back to the the start. One way of gaining advantage might be to simply knock the opponents sword, like so:
My sword’s on the line, yours isn’t, so I’ve won. But theres an easy counter, I’m sure you can think of it. Yes, you can simply move the sword out of the way, but you’re moving the sword off the line. You’re giving it up without me hitting it. 
A practiced swordsman will know all the moves, all the tricks and traps. So if you run into one, your best bet is to simply maintain a safe distance. You should run, if the mood calls for it.
How do I know if my opponent is skilled?
Oh, you’ll know in an instant whether or not your opponent knows about the line, about distance. The number of men I’ve killed with their sword out to the side like this, mid swing, its absurd. It’s like they’ve got this thought that if they start their swing first, that means I’ve got to parry it. It doesn’t enter their minds that I could just take a step forward, close the distance myself, and then stab them.

But if enemy know about distance, about the line, you should probably run. Everyone else, the mere fact that you’re considering it means your much more likely to win. And this is the thing about fighting - about everything really - it’s more about knowledge and experience than your god-given physical tools. I’m one of the smallest in the Ayramun, but no one here would fight me.


Strength, agility, these only come into play in bouts of similar skill.



About half the crew setting off in different direction. All the Ferzans + some others. 
“They aren’t coming. There’s too many Kackle trees over there.”
“What’s wrong with Kackle trees?”
“They’re shade-givers. They’re afraid them.”
“Ferzans are afraid of shade?”
“They love shade. It’s the trees they’re afraid of. They think the trees spread out like that and give so much shade to lure desperate creatures in. They think the trees release a poison into the air that kills whatever’s sitting under it.”
“Do they? I’ve sat under Kackle trees all my life.”
“No, they don’t. I can’t prove it, but, they don’t. But most Ferzans think the trees are trying to kill them. They think the roots feast on the bones once they’ve sunk into the earth.”
“That can’t be right.”
“It’s part of their whole mythology. I’m not too sure to be honest. Hard to get it out of them. But they won’t go near Kackle trees.”
“It doesn’t make sense. Trees aren’t even living things.”
“Of course they are. They move. Living things are things that move. They don’t move move, but they grow. That’s a kind of movement.”
“Movement isn’t what makes a thing alive. Rocks move.”
“I’m not talking about falling, or rolling down hill. Trees move on their own. They’re trying to do things. Shows they have souls.”
“I’m not talking about falling either. Have you ever been to the Sassa salt plain? The ground there is flat as can be for miles. There’s no rain. Dry as can be. No? Well I’ve walked across it, right across the middle of it. There’s rocks there, some small, some about a meter long, and sure, when you walk by them they’re still as can be, but they’ve got trails running behind them through the salt. They’re moving. Slowly, imperceptibly, maybe decades to move an inch, but they’re moving.”
“You’re lying.”
“I’m not lying. Rocks move. You haven’t heard of Sassa?”
Mandrameen shook his head.
“Well it’s there. The Sassa salt plain. About forty leagues west of Chunran. You should go and see it before you get all assured in your narrow definition of Life. I’m telling you, listen to an old man, it’s not as simple as movement.”
“What is it then?”
“It’s children. Living things have children. If a thing has a child, then it’s alive. If it doesn’t, it’s not.”
“That doesn’t make sense. You said that trees aren’t alive, but trees have children.”
“They don’t.”
“You sure about that?”
“Well, no, but… well it seems to me that trees, plants, they just make copies of themselves. It’s a static kind of thing. There’s no life.”
“That just seems absurd.”
“Why’s that?”
“Look… I don’t know. I don’t really think about this kind of stuff.”
“I’m telling you, it’s the children. Sex is part of it. If the things have sex, they’re alive.”
“It’s not the sex, it’s the killing,” Mazyd interjected.
They look at Mazyd like, wtf bro.
“If you call it life,” Mazyd continued, “it’s gotta be killing something, doesn’t it? Anything can die. You can crush a rock with a hammer and you can crush a bug with your thumb, yet we say the rock is a thing and the bug is a life. Why? Because the bug kills other bugs. That’s how you know they’re alive. That the cost of maintaining a soul - it’s the killing and then the eating.” That last word rolled through Mazyd’s beard like a saw.
“I hadn’t thought about that aspect of it,” Pyetle said.
“Makes sense from a Ferzan point of view. Trees are alive, so they’ve got to be killing something, no?”
“Yes,” Mazyd said, “Maybe all trees are killing us, slowly. Maybe that’s why we age. They’re releasing invisible poison into the air and we’re breathing it, right now we’re breathing it, and its making us age. We age, we die, we’re buried in the earth, and that’s when they feast on our bones. Maybe if it weren’t for trees we would be immortal.”
“What do you mean, ‘we’. You’re not human. You know, I know what you’re doing. I don’t like you. I’m not a barbarian so I’m not going to rough you up for the sake of it, but if I was, I would. So don’t talk.”
“Maybe he’s right,” Pyetle said. “There are stories of desert hermits, holy folk, living for hundreds of years.”
Bullo scrunched up his cheeks and said, “Now that is not true.”
“You seem certain,” Mazyd said. “But how can you be sure?”
Bullo looked at Mazyd with a fire. “What did I just say?”
“You said not to talk,” Mazyd answered, “but you also said you wouldn’t rough me up. You neutered your command as soon as you gave it.”
“Do you want me to hit you?” Bullo asked.
Mazyd’s diminutive form.
Mazyd looked at him and said, simply, “No.”
“But you understand that I have to hit you now, right?”
“You’ll do what you want. But there’d be no point. We Seilsi do not feel pain if we don’t want to.”
“So if I were to break your ribs, you wouldn’t be able to feel it?”
“I’d feel it. Though it wouldn’t be painful.”
“Well now I have to punch you.” Bullo, eager to test it out. 
Bullo punches him the side. 
Little effect.
“Seilsi don’t lie,” Mandri said.
“Hold on. I didn’t hear a crack.”
Bullo punches again. Clear, loud crack.
Instead of doubling over in pain. Sharp exhale, seemed to knock the wind out of him, but little else.
Bullo is like, wtf.
“I’m curious to see what you’ll do next, Seargent,” Mazyd said. “Seems the long years of thinking with your fists has cowed you. All you need to do is promise me some small pleasure in exchange for cooperation. Incentivize good behavior. Did the comissars not teach you this when you came up the ranks?”
“Pleasure? I’m not giving you anything.”
“Is there anything you want me to give you?”
“I want you to shut up.”
“Sargent -”
“Don’t fucking call me sargent.”
“Sargent Bullo, bigger things than your peace of mind are stake. I know all the strategies, logistics, and capabilities of the Imperial machine. Don’t you want that information from me? Doesn’t Ayram?”
“You’ll tell me how you plan to find the Jandri?”
“Nothing is off the table.”
“So what, I give you freedom, and you tell Ayram everything he wants to know? Actually that brings something to mind - why aren’t you having this conversation with Ayram? I’m just a foot soldier. I can’t give you anything even if you wanted it.”
“The reason I’m having this conversation with you, not Ayram, is because there is something you can give me.”
“And what is that?”
“Your protection.”
“Is that so?”
“Protection from anything or anyone that tries to kill me out here. For now, that means protection from the rest of the Ayramun. I know you’re not a barbarian, but the lot of them are. In fact I’ve heard how they plan to murder me before we reach Jughgar.”
“Who threatened you?”
“Well, they didn’t know I was listening. I am not human. I can hear better than -”
“It doesn’t matter,” Mandri interjected. “I’m sure they were just… expressing themselves. Ayram has said what he wants to do with you. He won’t allow them to kill you.”
“I don’t think they intend to get your leaders permission,” Mazyd said. “In fact, one of them said, 'I hate the bastard more than I fear Ayram’. That sentiment seemed to steel their nerves together. By all appearances, they intend to go through with it.”
“They said the feared Ayram?”
“They did.”
“I don’t believe you.”
Mazyd description. Huge and grand in the eyes despite the pitiful body. “Sargent, you know that one  of the many reasons why we Seilsi do not lie is because it helps us treat with our enemies. We can get somewhere in negotiations if they know  we’re telling the truth. I’m not saying you have to trust me. I won’t insult your intelligence. But you can trust what we say  as sure as you can trust the sand in the Hollow to blow east.”
Bullo tenses up.
“Well if an Ayramun is plotting against Ayram, then that’s something I would want to know. It’s not Mandri here, is it?”
“Do we have an agreement?”
“If an Ayramun wants to kill you, there’s not much I’m going to be able to do about it.”
“If these were men were like you, Sargent, men of resolve, then I would agree. But these are men of opportunity. Simple countermeasures should suffice.”
“We Ayramun lack many things, but one thing we’ve got buckets of is conviction. Really, that’s all we’ve got.”
“I’m not so sure about that. Irregardless, you are my best option for protecting myself. I can’t exactly ask them for forgiveness for whatever they think I’ve done to them.”
“What they think you’ve done to them? You don’t have any idea?”
“I’m sure I do.”
“You feel no guilt?”
“Virtue without terror is impotent, Sargent. Do you not agree?”
Expected equivication, shifting of blame. 
“Why do you think I’m out here? Sick dicks like you running things in the empire.”
“I don’t expect you to like me, Sargent. I do expect you’ll fill your end of the bargain.”
“I’ll talk to Ayram.”
“Keep our agreement between us. ”
“I keep nothing from Ayram.”
“I would feel better about our relationship if you didn’t - and that’s ultimately your goal here, no? The game within the game. It’s not about getting what you want from me, it’s about developing a working relationship, because only then you’ll get what you want from me.”
“What about Pyetle?”
“I trust Pyetle.”
Bullo gives odd look, but then, like whatever.
“Well Pyetle, go run off and help someone do something.”
Pyetle didn’t need to go and do anything. Mandri led Pyetle up to the front of the column, where Ayram walked. Ayram carring Pella on his back like swaddling babe.
Pyetle followed along behind. 
Sun setting. 
Far away, the minting rock.

“Life? Everything is alive, because everything is connected. Everything is the same thing. Think about it. Just because you can think about something as being by itself, in a void, dosn’t mean you should. We’re here, sitting here, but we’re together, we’re sitting on the ground. We require this food, this earth, and earth requires us. Look at what we’ve done to it. It’s all the same thing. Nothing exist in a void. It all exists together. Thinking any other way, and your just playing with yourself. Like the barber who shaves all men who do not shave themselves. Does he shave himself? Pointless to think about. It’s just a word game.”

            <Synopsis>Theives ambush gold caravan in the desert. A witch conjures storm to help them. Caravan has a mage, but storm strikes down mage before he can kill thieves. Turns out not to be a gold train - was a setup - The man who set them up? Salavan Saran.</Synopsis>
            <Text>The poet Melrameen, upon giving up the craft, said that every artist who has tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. For him it was a simple matter of fact: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see - but nothing is more seductive than Nature. Nothing can match its grandeur and complexity at scale, for inside every leaf, rock, cloud, and tree are systems within systems, patterns within patterns for as far as it is possible to look. 
Up or down, big or small, the shock of this beauty is everwhere and it goes straight to the spinal cord. If the mood is right, it hits with an intensity that no poet or painter could hope to achieve. There’s no point in trying.
Melrameen’s son, Mandrameen, disagreed. When he did, Mel told him to go out into the Sand and see for himself, to follow in the footsteps of the Jeketian Fathers. There the desert heat would pull his dreaming mind out from his body, like a cork from a bottle, and if he lingered in the sun near to death, then all his schemes and fantasies would evaporate. Nature’s beauty would fill the void and confront him with the truth about the edge between himself and the Universe.
Mel didn’t use so many words, but that was what he meant. And he didn’t think his son would actually do it, but at the age of eighteen, Mandrameen did. He ran out into the Sand. 
Three days later Mandri was near to death, just as his father had wanted. In his final hours he took up shelter under a karkle bush and just laid there as his toungue dried out and shrivled. 
Then a man - a giant of a man - found him in that gully. 
That man was Ayram.
Then and there, Mandri became an Ayramun.
That was all that Mandrameen cared to write about the day that Ayram saved his life. He was more thorough with the testimonies of his fellow Ayramun. He’d corner them whenever he could to get the story of their life before meeting Ayram. The best time to do it, Mandri found, was out on the morning watch. 
There was plenty of time then because morning did not come all at once to the Junei Plain. There the sun rises behind a coastal mountain range called the Blackshells. These mighty peaks guard a jagged blade of night from the approach of day. As the sun climbs up into the sky, and as its rays flood down into the plain, the mountains’ shadow slowly retreats to reveal a glowing sea of pink sand dunes, white gypsum, and salt. It’s not until three hands to noon that daylight reaches the pebbled foothills of the Blackshells themselves. It then creeps up the mountain slopes until at last, four fingers to midday, the whole of the Sand is lit.
Its not until then that heat gets into the air and kicks up a blistering wind, one which bakes the Earth like a furnace. There aren’t many hides or holes that can keep out this heat, but the closer you are to the peaks the longer you have till it gets to you - the longer you have to wake up. Up there, the Ayramun sleep for a good long while, giving Mandri plenty of time to pester his watch-partner about their history.
Today’s watch was with Seculla. She and Mandrameen were sitting atop a black cliff that overlooked the Junei pass. Below this cliff was a red clay road. Running east, the road disappeared into the mountains until eventually it came to the little port of Mudwater. Running west, the road wound around hills, black screes, and outcrops of rock until it came to the Junei Plain, and from there, it ran straight as an arrow to the horizon. 
It all made Mandri feel like a regular brigand. There they were, dwelling in the shadows, eyeing the brilliant plain with a fearful and jealous , searching for any sign of their quarry.
But the plain was was empty as far as Mandrameen could see.
Seculla’s eyes were better.
“Do you see them?” Mandri asked.
“I see nothing”, Seculla said, “I heard it’ll be another, I don’t know, two hands until they show up.”
“Two hands,” Mandrameen repeated. “That’s not so bad. In the meantime -”
“No.” 
“Why not?” Mandrameen asked. “What else is there to do?”
“I’ve told you a hundred times - I don’t want to talk about it.”
“Your past is as important as any other,” Mandrameen said. “More important, even. Outside of Pella you’ve been with Ayram the longest.”
“It’s not important.”
Mandrameen pulled a few dried figs from a pocket he’d sewn into his shirt and started to munch on them.
“Do you want one?” he asked.
“No.”
“Seculla, the world we’re building, it’s going to want to know who you are. And to know that they’ve got to know where you came from. So you’ve got to tell me.”
“There’s nothing worth telling.”
Mandrameen looked at Seculla with the most endearing smile he could muster. He wasn’t the most handsome man - his nose was a little too crooked for that - but he had the most sincere, cloying brown eyes of any human she’d ever met.
“Alright, fine,” she relented. “What do you want me to do.”
Mandrameen reached into his leather bag. He pulled out a folded reed scroll and a thin stick of charcoal. As he unfolded the scroll he found that it was filled on both sides with his rambling script, so he did what he could with his thumb to smudge out a few scribblings to make space.
“Details,” he said. “I need you to give me details.”
“There’s not much to say. I was a little kid. You could hardly call me a person. I don’t remember much.”
“How old were you?”
“I don’t know.”
“Give me a rough idea, then.”
“I don’t know.”
“Older than ten?” Mandrameen asked.
“Sure.”
Mandrameen scribbled a little something on his scroll. 
“I mean maybe I was, I don’t know.”
“If you’ve got a better idea, then out with it.”
“I don’t know. I think I was younger than ten, though.”
Mandrameen sighed. He rubbed out what he had written. “Let’s try something else,” he said.  “Do you remember meeting Ayram?”
“Of course.”
“Well? What happened? I heard rumors you were found in a… well, I’d rather hear you talk about it.”
Insert silence as mandrameen gives seculla some emotional distance to peer into the past.
“There’s a swarm of heatflies over there,” she said.
Mandrameen looked to where she was pointing. A swarm of about a hundred tiny heatflies were hovering together in a pocket of air. “What about them?”  he asked.
“Isn’t it odd how they swarm around each-other like that?” Seculla said. “What’s in that particular spot that keeps them all tethered there?”
The flies were indeed hovering in one spot. Almost like they were bound to small volume of air.
“It certainly is odd.” Mandrameen said. “But it’s what they do. Maybe they’re feasting on something smaller. Like when lizards start to swarm.” 
“I don’t think so. Other flies don’t do it.” 
Mandrameen shrugged.
Seculla seemed genuinely interested. “They’ve got the entire sky to fly around in,” she said. “They’ve got legs. They could walk all over too, if they wanted to.”
“Kind of like the people in Jeket, aren’t they?” Mandri said. “They’ve got the freedom to go anywhere, but they just don’t use it. They stay in one spot.”
“I don’t think that’s fair,” Seculla said. &quot;Maybe they stay put because the most interesting thing around is each other.”
“Well that’s cute,” Mandri said.
Seculla smiled. “I thought so.”
Mandrameen scribbled another little something in his scroll.
“What are you writing?” Seculla asked. “Are you writing what I just said?”
“Maybe I am, maybe I’m not. You should learn to read.”
“Whatever. Honestly, I don’t know the point of what you’re doing.”
“History is worth recording.”
Seculla scoffed. She even shook her head.
“All of this is going to be forgotten, Mandri. You see that crop of stones down there?”
Mandrameen looked down at where she was pointing. There was unremarkable mound of clay. A few large black stones stood up in the middle. 
“Yes, I see them,” he said.
“You can’t tell from here but that’s dressed stone. There must have been a tower there to guard this pass. Do you know who built it?”
“Some ancient Jandrian tribe, I would expect.”
“Nobody knows. And judging by those stones that had to have been a huge tower. Means there was a whole civilization here and the Sand just swallowed them up. No one knows anything about them.”
“I’m sure someone knows something.”
“No one I’ve met.”
“But this is different, though,” Mandrameen said with conviction. “Ayram’s building an empire of souls, not of stone.”
“It’s not different.”

“Mandri, prophets and messiahs pop up in Jeket because of all the gold that runs through it. They’re not popping up in some broke shit-hole across the sea like Kukra because there’s no gold in Kukra.”
“Well, maybe.”
“More than maybe. ”
“It is a point, I’ll give you that. It reminds me of a thought I had: Gold is just as bright and immutable as the Divine.”
“Mandri, please stop.”
“Did I tell you about that? There’s a poem in it. Look at this.”
He reached into his bag and pulled out a small, soft, and sparkling nugget of pure gold.
“Mandri! The hell are you doing with that?!”
“I know, I know, but I need it. Here, put it in your hand.” He grabbed Seculla’s hand and placed the gold in her palm. “Now, what do you feel?”
“I feel like punching you. Ayram will fucking kill you.”
“Just look at the gold. This thing was sitting in the dirt for who knows how long. A million years. And just look at it. Bright as the day the Gods put it in the ground. Roll it around in your hand. What do you feel?” 
Seculla did as instructed. She even tried to get into whatever mood Mandri was peddling. As she rolled the little nugget around in her hand she was struck by how drab it made everything else look.
“I want to hold a bigger lump,” she said.
“Yes!” Mandrameen  shouted. “That’s it! You put it in your hand and you get struck with a yearning for more. It’s a yearning akin to spiritual rapture. It washes over you. You can lose yourself to it. I swear its the just like being touched by the Gods.”
“You need to give this to Ayram.”
“There’s a poem in it.”
“Mandri.”
“I’ve got the component parts.” He unfurled his reed scroll a little more and flipped it over and began to read. “There’s the way that gold scintillates in the candlelight of a dark and cloistered room. Golden idols luring weak pilgrims out to the Sand’s depths. Hallowed places, you know.”
“Mandri, this is fucking ridiculous.”
“And the pilgrims, how they claim to hear whispered invitations leaping out of the rock, or out of the Sand or sky. And this is the crux: godless folk - this is you, poor Seculla - godless folk claiming that its just the whisperings of the gold, for they hear it too. They can hear it even while it sits in the ground, and just like pious men they devote their lives to the call.”
“I don’t get it.”
“Yes, it’s a subtle message.”
“No, I get it. It’s just that it’s hardly an original thought. Gods versus Greed. Pilgrims versus gold. It’s that tortured, ‘who are you really serving’ sermon that you hear echoing down every back alley in Jeket.”
“Oh that’s no matter,” Mandri said as he took the gold back from Seculla. He tucked it in his bag along with his scroll and charcoal. “It’s all in the execution,” he continued. “A good artist can make anything sublime. Its just a matter of execution.”
“Mandri, what the hell are you doing out here.”
“Seculla…Please.”
“Seriously. You should be closer to people, not out in the Sand ambushing caravans. Closer to Jeket.”
“But that’s the thing, though. We should all be closer to Jeket. That’s where this war is going to be won. It doesn’t matter what we do if the people can’t see us doing it. Cause it’s them whose going to win this war. They just need a little, artful, push. We can’t do that from here. I just don’t understand it.”
“You don’t agree with what Ayram’s doing?”
“No - no,” Mandrameen said. “I know what you are saying.”
“?”
“Look, Seculla. There’s what, fourty-five of us. There’s a million people in Jeket. We’re not the ones who’re going to throw the Empire out. Like I said, the people just need a little push. Its sheer numbers that will push the Empire out. Not us alone.”
Seculla whistled. “Don’t let Ayram hear you say that. Hell, don’t let Pella hear you say that. In fact, it’s best you not let anyone hear that. If you think you could do better, well just don’t think it.”
“You can’t!” Mandrameen repeated. His voice was pitching up, almost to a squeal. “It’s hard going! Doesn’t come as easy as pulling a bowstring. I mean I’d like to see you try to - what are you looking at?”
Seculla’s brow was dead-set and her eyes were scanning the landscape below.
“What is it?” Mandrameen whispered.
“Ayram’s coming.”
Mandrameen looked down and saw the distant speck of a giant of a man climbing up a knotted rope.
“So he is,” he said. “It’s finally time then.”
Seculla turned her eyes to the horizon.
“I can see a plume.” she said.
“There’s a plume?”
“Yeah. It’s still a ways out. That’s gotta be a pretty big caravan.”
“Gods, I can’t wait,” Mandrameen said. “Haven’t killed anyone in weeks.”
“Mandri, remember, keep your ideas to yourself. Ayram doesn’t need them. And you should probably give him that piece of gold.”
“I will not. What does he need it for? It’s only a small bit.”
“What do you need it for?”
“Inspiration.”
“Mandri. Fuck. I swear to the Gods if you-”
“Let’s drop on down, shall we? I want to hear what Ayram and Pella are planning.”
Seculla looked crossly.
“Fine.”
Seculla lowered herself onto the cliff-face, and Mandrameen followed. It was a long but easy downclimb to the crag of rock where Pella, and now Ayram, stood. 


Mandrameen thought the sight of Ayram standing next to Pella was quite silly. Pella was the oldest and shortest of their band, and Ayram towered over her, tall and skinny, like the shadow of Death.  He was a good four heads taller. Taller than any man Mandrameen had ever seen. It didn’t help that Pella was bent over, peering through the lens of her scopic copper tube which was balanced upon a stick. She looked like a child next to him, swaddled up as she was against the wind.
By the time Seculla and Mandrameen alighted on the crag, Pella was already grumbling to Ayram. 
“Something seems off,” she said.
“Oh, shush your squawking, old crow,” Seculla said playfully.
“Shush my!? Shush yours, young pup!”
Mandrameen crept up behind Seculla and offered his support. “There’s nothing to worry about, Pella. We’re simply too skilled to ever be captured.”
“You’re stupid, Mandri,” Pella declared. “Skill has nothing to do with it. It’s caution that keeps you alive. Tell them, Ayram.”
Mandri and Seculla looked up at Ayram. He was so tall and stood so close on the cramped crag that they could hardly see his face. 
“Young pups don’t learn easy. Not till the prey fights back.” Ayram’s voice was as deep and as gritty as he looked. It was like there was room enough in his broad chest for the sound to bounce around for so long that when it popped out of his mouth it was as ancient as the Earth.
“My bones are a-rattling,” Pella said. Her voice hoarse and scratchy from years of freeweed abuse. Even now there was a wrap smoldering away in her bony fingers.  She never went without it, especially when things were coming to a head.
She leaned down again to spy the distant caravan through her scope. From this perch high in the strata of a sandstone cliff, she could pick out riders. Her eyes were still sharp. She could even count their number, all the way back to the rear of their column. 
“There’s seventy-two of them,” she said. “And there’s something unnatural as well. I don’t think we should go for it.”
“Aw, Pella,” Seculla said. “We’ve not had a lick of blood for two weeks.”
“Be quiet. What are you even doing here. Ayram, tell them to go away.”
“Pella,” Ayram began, “what do you mean ‘there’s something unnatural’?”
Ayram’s eyes were sharp as any, but without aid of a scope he could only make out the dust cloud the quarry was kicking up - it billowed high into the air. It shone bright as the early morning light picked it out against the darker hues of the fleeing night. 
“There’s an odd fix about them.” Pella said.
“An odd fix? You’ve counted seventy-two. That’s exactly how many Salavan said there’d be. This is the right time and place.”
“I don’t doubt your man in Jeket. But still, something is off.”
Ayram kept silent to give Pella time to study the caravan. It would be stupid to ignore the mood of a woman whose misgivings had saved them time and time again.
“It’s the way they ride,” Pella concluded. She moved aside to let Ayram peer through the scope. “Have you ever seen a caravan guard ride three by three like that?” she asked. 
Ayram bent down on one knee and put his eye to the rim of the brass eyepiece. The wagons and their guard quickly came into focus.
“No,” he replied. 
“I don’t think we should go for it,” Pella repeated.
Ayram shrugged her off and took a moment to absorb the details. 
There were eight wagons, several more than the average for a gold train. The tight discipline of the riders made it easy to count their number: three by three as Pella had said. Hardly the ragged band of backwash from the Empire’s conquests that passed for caravan hands this far out in the Sand. Ayram couldn’t make out any insignia or marks that might identify them as professional soldiers. Still, they were quite far out on the Junei plain, and Pella’s old scope was a little dusty. 
Ayram compared what he saw to the lay of the ambush that he had set up below. It was the most ideal spot to bushwhack such a heavily guarded merchant caravan. It was one of the few short and straight ravines through which a road actually passed. Its slopes were steep so his people would have a clean shot at the whole column, provided the whole caravan could fit inside. Though there were few trees, there were plenty of boulders and prickly brown bushes for cover. The way out of the ravine was easy enough to manage with caltrops buried in the sand. Here, the road wasn’t wide enough for the wagons to turn around and beat a hasty retreat. Against fearful men, it would be a slaughter. Against experienced warriors, Ayram was not so sure.
“If they weren’t wearing that woolen garb I’d take them for Imperial cavalry,” Ayram said.
“It could be that they’ve been drilling common hands,” Seculla suggested.
“That could be.”
“Or, it could be that those really are Imperial riders,” Pella added.
“But they’re wrapped in white wool,” Seculla said.
“You’re wrapped in wool and you’re Imperial.” Pella said.
“Used to be.”
“Sure, sure. Me as well,” Pella said. “Didn’t mean anything by it.”
“Pella,You were an Imperial priestess, not an officer,” Mandrameen said. “Officers don’t drop their company’s colors for convenience. Even in the desert.”
Pella laughed. “The Sand makes converts of us all, Mandri. Uniforms be damned.” At that she spit off the side of the cliff and watched it fall. It swayed a little in the cool breeze and landed fifty yards below, where the boy Sendren was stringing his helmwood bow. Sendren looked up at Pella and muttered a curse, but Pella just shook her head and pointed up above her, innocently directing Sendren’s ire towards Relsa who was perched atop the cliff.
“The point of a uniform isn’t comfort,” Mandrameen said. “For them it’s hardly even for protection.  It’s about distinction. I know these types.” 
Pella turned to the two young pups and scowled at them. “Mandri. Seculla. Shut up. Don’t talk again.” She then turned back to Ayram. “Well?”
“I think they could be fighting men,” Ayram said.
“They could be rabble, they could be Imperials. Would it change your call?” She asked it as if she already knew the answer.
“If they are Imperial then they have skin in the game.”
“They won’t run when the killing starts,” Pella said, finishing his thought.
“And the way we’re set up -”
“This only works if they try to run.”
“It’s only completely safe if they run,” Ayram corrected. 
“Doesn’t matter,” Pella said. “It’s off then.”
Ayram took a moment once more to eye the caravan through Pella’s scope, trying to find some detail that might still swing his decision. 
The information he’d been given by Salavan was accurate - the caravan was here as predicted. He and his people were eager, rested, and ready. The long shadows of the rising sun would keep them hidden until the most opportune moment. There was even the off chance that the witch’s magic might work. Most importantly, their secret way into and out of the ravine was a hidden crevasse which remained unknown to the Empire, and every day that Ayram delayed he risked its discovery. If found, this stretch of the Junei would be closed to him forever.
“Disciplined riders aren’t enough to call this off,” Ayram decided, and handed the glass back to Pella. 
Mandrameen and Seculla shared a look of glee.
“Then should I whistle the boys?” Pella asked, looking a little grim. It was a look which came quite easy for her.
“Yes,” Ayram replied. “Be sure to stab and flutter it. Like you say, we need caution.”
 Pella nodded, then put her hands to her mouth and whistled the song of the Jade Tresset to let the men know that the ambush was on. She stabbed and fluttered the high notes, as Ayram had directed.
Ayram waited a bit for twittered replies to spring from his people’s hiding spots, and then he squeezed his giant frame into the little cave behind them, leaving Pella to deal with Seculla and Mandrameen as they bickered over  who got to look through the scope.
Cloistered within the cramped cave was the witch Elrahet. She was an older woman, five years younger than Pella, although a specific age was rarely a thing ascribed to people of the Sand. Like Ayram, she was Jandrian, and all Jandrians seemed to foreigners like they had been quarried fully formed out of the earth. Their features were as dark, hard, and solemn as any slab of Melthasite ore. Their sun-drenched skin was as brown and leathered as the bark of any pepperwood tree.  Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the sizable horned lizard over whose corpse she squatted.
The beast was belly up, and her fingers were knuckle deep in it’s guts, twisting and twirling as her lips whispered incantations and her eyes searched the pink sliver of morning sky that peeked through the crack in the rocks above.
“It’s almost time,” Ayram warned.
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, though she did not take her eyes off the sky, nor her hand from the lizard’s corpse.
“What thing is more vital than blood?” she asked the world. 
“Blood cold as ice…” 
She pushed down with the palm of her hand to squeeze acids out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Blood hot as a raging fire….” 
She squeezed the intestinal organs with her knotted fingers. 
“We would be gods if not for blood…”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up.
“We would be dust without it.” 
Elrahet threw the entrails down, back into the body cavity, then stared intently at whatever was going on within.
When nothing happened, she snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s belly wider. Into the hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, then pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin.
The lizard’s belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched and its tail curled. Ayram supposed that the thing was somehow still alive. When Elrahet finally pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh, it went completely limp.
“It is possible,” Elrahet said to Ayram in a quiet whisper so that none outside could hear, “that the beast is infertile.” 
“So this won’t work?” Ayram knelt across from her.
“Not with this beast.”
Ayram spread apart the lizard’s corpse. He could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-grey intestines writhed and pulsed like a knotted mass of worms. 
He was impressed.
“Well... it was worth a try,” he said.
Elrahet hissed at his dubiety. “I just need fertile blood. Fresh fertile blood,” she stressed.
Ayram thought for a moment, then pulled up his sleeve and extended his hairy brown arm towards Elrahet.
“Your blood? I won’t carve you open,” Elrahet croaked. “Get me one of the Pazard boys or something.”
“There’s no time. It’s either me or Pella... Or no one.” 
“That old Imperial sow isn’t fertile.”
“Well then,” Ayram said, extending his arm further.
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given by one Jandrian to another. Elrahet had been Ayram’s witch for years and he had never offered a drop. She tried to gauge his countenance to see if he was sincere - but his face was set deep in the shadow of his hood and his eyes were sunk back behind bushy brows. His beard hid whatever slight expression his lips might reveal. Even clean shaven and in direct light, the difference between his smile and a frown was almost imperceptible. 
She looked down at his arm and eyed the veins that bulged under the skin. She knew his blood would be potent. 
“We can do this without you,” Ayram said with more than a hint of impatience.
At that, Elrahet pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from her bag and laid them between herself and Ayram. Then she unsheathed a patterned blade from her belt and held it’s curve length-wise to Ayram’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said.
“And I yours,” Ayram replied. 
Elrahet savored his courtesy with a near-toothless grin, then eagerly plunged her dagger’s tip into his flesh. She flicked her wrist with expert care and opened the vein. Ayram remained unstirred, watching with serious intent as blood bubbled out of the wound and ran around his wrist in a steady stream to drip into the bowl.
 When he had enough, he jerked his arm free.
“That’s it.” He said. 
The bowl was just half full.
“Your gift is humbling, but if that is it… don’t expect much,” Elrahet grumbled.
“I did say that we can do this without you.”
Elrahet scowled, then took the bowl and began to flick Ayram’s blood onto the lizard’s corpse, careful to make sure that not a drop hit the dirt.
Ayram took the yard of linen to dress his wound. As he tried to maneuver his hips round so he could leave, he bumped Elrahet. 
“Get out of here!” she snapped. 
Ayram laughed as he did.

Maybe do short desc. Of the ravine here.

The first signs of Elrahet’s magic were the wispy vapor trails that circulated high in the atmosphere above her cave. They twirled and danced, driven by unnatural purpose, though they were so slight that they could hardly be said to be there at all. By the time Ayram sat down at his hiding spot behind a couple of small boulders on the northern slope of the ravine, the trails had begun to congeal into something thicker.
Soon the wind picked up and began to brush them into form, and it blew a pleasant musk of earthy, humid air down into the ravine. If Ayram had not been looking for it, he might not have noticed how a light fog subtly shifting into existence. Just as he began to wonder if the crew had taken notice, a low rolling drum of distant thunder echoed through the valley, though there was, as yet, no great storm from which it could have come.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” said Papillian excitedly. The boy was stationed behind a boulder closer to the road. Ayram glared down at him with sufficient sternness to shush him. He didn’t blame the lad for the outburst as this was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of magic.
It was perhaps too good. The merchant caravan was still far out. Perhaps they had not yet made it into the valley’s fingers. Perhaps they could see the cyclonic flow of haze that now swirled above Elrahet’s cave. Still, Ayram half expected that it all might fizzle out - humans made for poor magicians - but all his doubts were allayed when dense clouds began to creep out from some invisible fissure in the sky.
They crept out slowly, like cautious cattle out of the pen. Once they were out over the ravine they began to feed, to chew and swallow the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of the lizard that Elrahet had prepared. 
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, just little pricklings on the skin, just a light peppering of the sandy rocks and clay. The drizzle cleansed the air of the desert dust that was ever present in the Sand, the stuff that clogged the nose and scratched the throat. In fact the air was so crisp that this was the first time in forever that Ayram could take in a full, clean breath. It was a tranquil moment, but short lived, for minute by minute the wind swelled and the rain thickened and the storm above ballooned into a supercell the size of several mountains. Lightning flashed and thrashed around in the belly of the beast above, banging the drum of thunder.
More and more the rain began to pour. Without shelter it seemed like torture. The short and woody weeds that had managed to scrape out an existence in the ravine were whipped to and fro as the wind and rain stripped leaf from stem. It came down hard and wet on the men as well. Ayram found little comfort in the fact that he had his back to it all.  
At least the earth seemed to enjoy it, parched and desiccated as it was. It took its time to drink its fill. It filtered the water through sand and silt and then trickled it down into the deep reservoirs of the world. It savoured every drop, and it drank slowly, which meant that it did not take long for the surface to become soaked. Soon rain began to pitter-patter into puddles, and water ran down the ravine, seeking out the familiar routes that it had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millenia. Where once there were cracks, pits, and sinks in the rock and clay, there were now streams and cascades. Where once there were depressions and scars, there were now pools in which desert life would find succor.
Ayram looked over to the young Papillian. Though the rain was rare and precious on this side of the Junei Mountains, the boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers. He might as well have been swimming. 
He muttered a curse, and the storm cursed back.


CRACK-BOOM!


A bright and gnarled flash of lightning split the dark sky above. 
It hit somewhere near in the cliffs behind them.
Everyone jumped.
“Elra’s never conjured more than foggy mist!” Papillian exclaimed.
Colm, a beastly man to Papillian’s side could be heard as well. “Bit much innit?”
Ayram disagreed.  By this point the valley road was getting good and slick and muddy. Laden wagons would have to be dragged through it. They would be moving slowly, if they would move at all - though that was cause for some concern. They might not even make it into the ravine. Or, they might have turned around and fled the valley as soon as the first showers hit them.
 Then a faint horse’s whinny pierced the splashing of the rain. 
Ayram turned his gaze southward. There he could just make out the shapes of white horses coming round the bend. Their riders were hunched in their saddles, sore backs and sore nerves all around. Their horses moved slowly, leaning into the deluge. Ayram could almost feel the mud draining their already tired legs of vigor. He smiled when he saw one stumble and throw its rider into a growing rivulet.
Nonetheless they all plodded onward, heads down against the pelting rain, filtering into the ravine three by three. Their wagons were faring as Ayram expected, with drivers working hard to steady the mood of the mule-teams that had grown discontent with the whole situation. If the mules had been men they would have taken up arms long ago in a suicidal bid for freedom. As beasts, all they could do was scream through their suffering and sway against the strain and slip in the viscous mud.
Ayram would have been perfectly pleased if he hadn’t noticed the olive skin and tufts of blackred hair peeking out from under the soldiers’ turbans. They were each, to a man, Roman[a]. This was indeed a company of Imperial Cavalry. Then he caught sight of the wooden septum piercings that popped out of their noses like bull horns. These were men of the Hallowed Guard- the absolute elite.
Ayram's pulse quickened, and he could feel his nerves tighten as he peered out at them from behind his rock. Just a few sheets of rain separated him from this pride of lions - to be this close was suicide. Even though all smells were driven down into the earth, and all edges and colors were blurred, and all sounds below a shout were drowned out by the torrential downpour, Ayram felt like they could sense him. Such is the case when a predator hunts a predator; they have little familiarity, little tolerance for doubt and fear. It does not take much of that drug to overwhelm them.
By the time the middle of column had reached Ayram’s position, he had steadied his nerve. He then leaned out from behind his rock, aimed his bow towards one of their number, notched an arrow, and let it fly.
In clean, dry air his gull-feather arrow would trill with excitement when released, but so wetted by the rain it simply jumped from the waxed string of his bow. So quiet and obscured was its flight, and so loud was the wind and rain, that even after it struck its target and sank him low in his saddle, the caravan remained oblivious to the danger.
 The dead rider’s horse took a few steps, then the body slipped from its perch and fell into the mud. 
So began the battle.
Cries of horse and rider flew as a hail of arrows leapt from the slopes of the ravine, planting themselves in throats and ribs. Some bounced off armor or missed their marks all together and fell into the mud. Even Ayram had trouble in these tight quarters, for the wind and rain was so strong that they carried his arrows unpredictably; just a meter was enough to spare or doom a life. 
Hardly a third of the riders were stricken in the first few volleys. For a company of Hallowed Guardsmen, the bodycount was no convincing argument for retreat.
 An officer’s horn sounded. It bellowed then sank into a deep register that rumbled the streams and puddles that already ran red with blood. Those riders which had not already dismounted did, and they pulled their heater shields from off their horses' packs, then rushed to form up a defensive shape centered in the ravine just below Ayram. Here and there one of them would shudder then fall to his knees as an arrow snuck through the wall of shields, his hands clutching wherever his flesh was pierced. His compatriots would kick him out of the circle and down into the mud, then close ranks behind him. 
They moved and thought as one, and like a leaf-scaled wyrm caught out in the open Sand by a falcon, they curled and curled again.
Ayram eyed them warily, wondering what they could possibly do to prevent his party’s arrows from whittling them down one by one.
Then a man amongst them broke rank stepped forward. He seemed misshapen, and was bare and bald, and his sleeves were rolled up to reveal an intricate tattoo that weaved round his wrists and up his arms. 
Then his hands began to glow.
Ayram notched an arrow and aimed for the man’s neck, so that he might stifle the power that he channeled in those arms and that he brewed in those lungs. 
Before he could let it fly, the storm intervened. 


CRACK-BOOM!

Need to magnify the dstruction. THe horror of his comrades dying.


A bolt of lighting shot down from the high icy reaches of the thunderhead. It struck the middle of the road with an incredible ferocity, and as it did it seemed to explode, throwing wind, rain, and flesh in all directions. The shockwave threw Ayram back against the rocks of the ravine, and there was a muted thwack as his skull hit the broad face of a sandstone boulder. 
Then things went black.

	- Well, like all great works of art, we see different things. Different interpretations. I think the theme is love. Abstract I know. Redefining the word. It is nearness. Depending upon something else for your own identity. That is love. That is relationships. That is all that exists. That is God. That is the Universe.


Ya’ll remember that thing with the planes.
Wild how I can say so little info, and you know immediately what I’m talking about. That thing with the planes. What a big deal. Can’t say, ‘that thing with the plane’, cause then I could be talking about a whole host of things. Sully diving into the hudson. Russia shooting down that flight with all those dutch scientists onboard. Snakes on a plane. But there’s never been something to rival 9/11, something with multiple planes.
It got me to thinking what other things I could just throw out a general description of and you’d know what I’m talking about. There’s the obvious one: that thing with the jews. Conversely, that thing with the Germans.
It’s kind of sad that ‘that thing with the blacks’ doesnt quite work. It almost does. You’d hope it would just be the transatlantic slave trade, and we’d be done with it, but there’s been too much shit in the interim. Rodney king. George Floyd. Crack Cocaine. AIDS.



Murder suspect talking about multi-level marketing when the biggest moment of life is impending. Bout to be accused of murder, and they talk about other shit to delay what they know is coming. A moment of escape from the most terrifying moment of their life. Denial.
The detective dangles hope for 45 minutes. Dective knows she did it, but ‘toys’ with the prey. Cruel. Ostensibly, to get most information as possible. Continuously claw at her own salvation. Divulge information that will be damaging to her defense later on.

Detective accuses guy, says he has proof. Guy is innocent, gives a non-verbal challenge (like, wtf? Tilt of head, furrowed brow.) Maintains eye contact through head movement - establishes that he is the more confident person in the room at the moment.

A harrowing mixture of pain, regret, and resignation in his voice. The junkie. The antihero.

A kind of muttering drawl caused by a toothache.  A jawache. 

Glimmer of humanity - “Thanks for the coke” - the smaller things reveal the most. Extends teh gratitude and recognition of the small favor he has done for him. Element of selflessness and grace of the act.

Anders Breivik - mothers dislike of him began in the womb. She believed he was kicking her on purpose. After he was, born, she thought he was intent on destroying her, and was fundamentally evil. Thought he was clingy and demanding. She left him alone for long periods of time. Mother often told him that she wished he was dead. Had a smile that was not connected to his feelings. Was aggressive and she projected sexual fantasies onto him. Mother hated all men and projected this onto Anders. 



Seems heartless to take a child from his mother like that.
Being a Jedi is essentially selfish pursuit, because if we cannot master ourselves, we cannot help others. To do that, we cannot give parts of ourselves to other people. Even to our mothers. You cannot master yourself if someone else has a piece of you. In most biologies, family has an imprinting that must be avoided. Varies in age, but if we cannot get to a child before he is too old, before he has given a part of himself to his mother, his father, then we are too late.
If they don’t ever experience those relationships, then how could you ever empathise with someone who does?

I’ve actually never told a joke that has made people laugh before
*someone laughs*
See I can do without trying but

Stress is what kept me awake last night. Stress over something that doesn’t affect me at all. My primitive systems have been hijacked by corporate marketing agencies. They’ve kept me awake because they got in front of my face about a ‘pressing’ issue in another part of the world. I’ve been had. I’ve become a consumer. Artificial stimultion for clicks, views, ads. This is the modern life. They *know* what they’re doing.

            <Text>Chapter 1 : Ayram
  
______________


The poet Mandrameen once said that every artist who has tried to capture the beauty of Nature has failed. For him the problem is always the same: art is seduction, its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the artist wants you to see - but nothing is more seductive than Nature. Nothing can match it’s grandeur and complexity at scale, for inside every leaf, rock, cloud, and tree are systems within systems, patterns within patterns for as far as it is possible to look. The shock of this beauty goes straight to the spinal cord, and if the mood is right, it hits with an intensity that no poet or painter could hope to achieve.
Mandrameen taught that the Sand focuses this beauty. There the desert heat pulls the mind out from the body, like a cork from a bottle, and if you are left to linger in the sun, all desires, plots, and fantasies will evaporate. Nothing is left to support a delicate ego. When Nature’s beauty rushes in, it flushes the ego out, it loses it in the wide open spaces of sand and sky. All that’s left for the inner eye to see is the truth about the edge between one’s self and the Universe.
Or so Mandrameen believed. 
It was at least an honest attempt to explain why all religions of the Empire were born in the Sand, and why the beating heart of each of them is the grand city of Jeket, Jewel of the Desert, an oasis in the middle of the world. 
The cynic Seculla took a different view. She claimed that prophets and messiahs flock to the Sand - and Jeket in particular - because gold flows through it. The stuff filters into the city from mines in the interior, and once the cut is taken, it leaves down river then out to sea towards Carcina, the Empire’s capital. 
Whether or not this is true is a matter of taste. What is undeniable is that, for most folk, gold is more tempting than eternal salvation. After all, gold is just as bright and as immutable as the Divine, but you can touch it. If a pure, soft, sparkling spot of it gets into your hands you’ll be struck with a yearning akin to spiritual rapture, a yearning for more of it, for as much as you can get. The more enterprising religions channel this effect by casting the gold into idols, and use it to ornament their sacred texts and the walls of their heavenly dwellings. The way that gold scintillates in the candlelight of a dark and cloistered room creates an impression of holiness that is strong enough to lure pilgrims out to shrines nestled deep in the Sand. In such hallowed places, the chosen few may hear the whispered calls of their deities, but godless folk claim that its just the whisperings of the gold, for they hear it too, they can hear it even deep in the ground, and like pious men they devote their lives to the call. 
Whatever the reasons for the greed, the religiosity, the pilgrims, the gold, the Empire and its merchant companies, the stage was set in Jeket for Ayram and the band of thirty three killers that followed him. They were religious in their own way, zealots of a kind, but chiefly they were known as thieves, and they were simply too skilled to ever be captured. 
Pella would say, “Too cautious to be captured”, and as the eldest of Ayram’s band, that was how she liked it. She was sensitive to the risks that younger folk were willing to take, for she had made many of them herself - her fake brass nose could attest to that. Its hard and sparkling sheen stood out oddly against her loose and wrinkled skin, almost as if it were wearing her instead of the other way around. For Pella, it was a reminder of her duty to preach caution and steer the young pups away from prey that fights back. 
This imperative dwelled deep in her old arthritic bones, for they would get to tingling whenever danger was near, just as they were tingling now.
“This doesn’t seem right,” she grumbled, her voice hoarse and scratchy from years of freeweed abuse. She peered through the lens of her scopic copper tube which was balanced upon a stick. From her perch high in the strata of a sandstone cliff, she could pick out the riders of a distant merchant caravan, and could count their number all the way back to the rear of their column. 
“Seventy-two... and there’s something unnatural about them,” Pella said.  “I don’t think we should go for it.”
Ayram was standing next to her, taller by at least two feet. He was a giant of a man but skinny, and all his limbs were wrapped tight in wool and leather as if to accentuate his ganglyness. He was stroking his scraggly beard as he tracked Pella’s gaze.
“What do you mean ‘something unnatural’?” he asked.  
With his vision unaided, Ayram could only make out the dust cloud kicked up by the distant caravan - it billowed high into the air and shone brightly as the early morning light picked it out against the darker blue of the fleeing night sky. 
“There’s an odd fix about them.” Pella said.
“An odd fix? You’ve counted seventy-two. That’s exactly how many Salavan said there’d be, and they’re coming along at exactly the right time and place.”
“I don’t doubt your man in Jeket. But still, something is off.”
Ayram kept silent to give Pella time to study their quarry, for it would be stupid to ignore the mood of a woman whose misgivings had saved them several times before.
“It’s the way they ride,” Pella concluded. She moved aside to let Ayram peer through the scope. “Have you ever seen a caravan guard ride three by three like that?” she asked. 
Ayram bent down on one knee and put his eye to the rim of the brass eyepiece. The wagons and their guard quickly came into focus.
“No,” he replied. 
“I don’t think we should go for it,” Pella repeated.
Ayram shrugged her off and took a moment to absorb the details. 
There were eight wagons, several more than the average for a gold train, and the tight discipline of the riders made it easy to count their number; three by three as Pella had said. Hardly the ragged band of backwash from the Empire’s conquests that passed for caravan hands this far out. Ayram couldn’t make out any insignia or marks that might identify them as professional soldiers. Still, they were quite far out on the Junei plain, and Pella’s old scope was a little dusty. 
Ayram compared what he saw to the lay of the ambush that he had set up below. It seemed the most ideal spot to bushwhack such a heavily guarded merchant caravan. It was one of the few short and straight ravines through which a road actually passed. Its slopes were steep so his people would have a clean shot at the whole column, provided all seventy-two and all eight wagons could fit inside. Though there were few trees, there were plenty of boulders and prickly brown bushes for cover. The ends of the ravine were easy enough to manage with chains buried in the sand, which when tugged through pulleys bolted into the rocks, would burst upwards and trap their quarry in.
Against fearful men, it would be a slaughter. 
Against experienced warriors, Ayram was not so sure.
“If they weren’t wearing that woolen garb I’d take them for Imperial cavalry,” Ayram said.
        “It could be that they’ve been drilling common hands,” Pella suggested.
        “That could be.”
“Or, it could be that those really are Imperial riders.”
“But they’re wrapped in white wool.”
“Sure, sure. But I’m wrapped in wool and I’m Imperial. Used to be anyways,” Pella said.
“An Imperial priestess, not an officer,” Ayram corrected. “Officers don’t drop their company’s colors for convenience. Even in the desert.”
Pella just laughed. “The Sand makes converts of us all, Ayram. Uniforms be damned.” At that she spit off the side of the cliff and watched it fall. It swayed a little in the cool breeze and landed fifty yards below, where the boy Sendren was stringing his helmwood bow. Sendren looked up at Pella and muttered a curse, but Pella just shook her head and pointed up above her, innocently directing Sendren’s ire towards Relsa who was perched atop the cliff.
“The point of a uniform isn’t comfort,” Ayram said. “For them it’s hardly even for protection.  It’s about distinction.” 
“Sure, sure. But still,” Pella said.
“Yes,” Ayram relented, “they could be fighting men.”
“They could be rabble, they could be Imperials. Would it change your call?” Pella asked, thinking she knew the answer.
“If they are Imperial then they’ll have skin in the game.”
“They won’t run when the killing starts,” Pella said, finishing his thought.
“And the way we’re set up…”
        “This only works if they run.”
“Well… it’s only completely safe if they run.” 
“So it’s off then.”
Ayram took a moment once more to eye the caravan through Pella’s scope, trying to find some detail that might still swing his decision. 
The information he’d been given was accurate - the caravan was here as predicted. He and his people were eager, rested, and ready. Smooth sandstone boulders were levered and the tripline fittings were set. The long shadows of the rising sun would keep them hidden until the most opportune moment. There was even the off chance that the witch’s magic might work. Most importantly, their way into and out of the ravine was a hidden crevasse which remained unknown to the Empire, and every day that Ayram delayed he risked its discovery. If found, this stretch of the Junei would be closed to thieves forever.
“Disciplined riders aren’t enough to call this off,” Ayram finally decided, and handed the glass back to Pella. 
“Then should I whistle the boys?” Pella asked, looking a little grim - a look which came quite easy for her.
“Yes,” Ayram replied. “Be sure to stab and flutter it. We need a little extra caution.”
 Pella nodded, then put her hands to her mouth and whistled the song of the Jade Tresset to let the men know that the ambush was on, and she stabbed and fluttered the high notes, as Ayram had directed.
Ayram waited a bit for twittered replies to spring from his people’s hiding spots, and then he squeezed his giant frame into the little cave behind him.


Cloistered within the cramped space was the witch Elrahet. She was an older woman, ten years younger than Pella, although a specific age was rarely a thing ascribed to people of the Sand. Like Ayram, she was Jandrian, and all Jandrians seemed to foreigners like they had been quarried fully formed out of the earth. Their features were as dark, hard, and solemn as any slab of Melthasite ore. Their sundrenched skin was as brown and leathered as the bark of any pepperwood tree.  Elrahet was as much a native creature of the Sand as the sizable horned lizard over whose corpse she squatted.
The beast was belly up, and her fingers were knuckle deep in it’s guts, twisting and twirling as her lips whispered incantations and her eyes searched the pink sliver of morning sky that peeked through the crack in the rocks above.
“It’s almost time,” Ayram warned.
 Elrahet grimaced and spat at this interruption, though she did not take her eyes off the sky, nor her hand from the lizard’s corpse.
        “What thing is more vital than blood?” she asked the world. 
“Blood cold as ice…” 
She pushed down with the palm of her hand to squeeze acids out from the lizard’s stomach. 
“Blood hot as a raging fire….” 
She squeezed the intestinal organs with her knotted fingers. 
“We would be gods if not for blood…”
 She ripped the entrails out of their webbed lining, and raised them up.
“We would be dust without it.” 
Elrahet then threw the entrails down, back into the body cavity, and stared intently at whatever was going on within.
When nothing happened, Elrahet snarled an arcane curse and tore the gash in the lizard’s belly wider. Into the hole she stuck her skinny arm up to the elbow, then pushed the beast’s innards around in pursuit of something in its groin.
Its belly bulged and squirmed. Once or twice its limbs twitched, and its tail curled. Ayram supposed that the thing was somehow still alive. When she finally pulled her arm free and sat back with a defeated sigh, it went completely limp.
“It is possible,” Elrahet said to Ayram in a quiet whisper so that none outside could hear, “that the beast is infertile.” 
“So this won’t work?” Ayram asked as he knelt across from her.
“Not with this beast.”
Ayram spread apart the lizard’s corpse. He could sense a power coming from the gaping hole in its belly. The blue-grey intestines seemed to writhe and pulse like a knotted mass of worms. 
He was impressed.
“Well... it was worth a try,” he said.
Elrahet hissed at his dubiety. “I just need fertile blood. Fresh fertile blood,” she stressed.
        Ayram thought for a moment, then pulled up his sleeve and extended his hairy brown arm towards Elrahet.
        “I won’t carve you open,” Elrahet croaked. “Get me one of the Pazard boys or something.”
        “There’s no time. It’s either me or Pella... Or no one.” 
        “That old Imperial sow isn’t fertile.”
        “Well then,” Ayram said, extending his arm further.
Blood was a sacred thing and it was never lightly given by one Jandrian to another. Elrahet had been Ayram’s witch for years and he had never offered a drop to her. She tried to gauge his countenance to see if he was sincere - but his face was set deep in the shadow of his hood and his eyes were sunk back behind bushy brows. His beard hid whatever slight expression his lips might reveal. Even clean shaven and in direct light, the difference between his smile and a frown was almost imperceptible. 
She looked down at his arm and eyed the veins that bulged under the skin. She knew his blood would be potent. 
“We can do this without you,” Ayram said with more than a hint of impatience.
At that, Elrahet pulled a yard of linen and a clay bowl from her bag and laid them between herself and Ayram. Then she unsheathed a patterned blade from her belt and held it’s curve length-wise to Ayram’s wrist.
“I value your trust,” she said.
“And I yours,” Ayram replied. 
Elrahet savored his courtesy with a near-toothless grin, then eagerly plunged her dagger’s tip into his flesh. She flicked her wrist with expert care and opened the vein. Ayram remained unstirred, watching with serious intent as blood bubbled out of the wound and ran around his wrist in a steady stream to drip into the bowl.
 When he had enough, he jerked his arm free.
“That’s it.” He said. 
The bowl was just half full.
“Your gift is humbling, but if that is it… don’t expect much,” Elrahet grumbled.
“I did say that we can do this without you.”
Elrahet scowled, then took the bowl and began to flick Ayram’s blood onto the lizard’s corpse, careful to make sure that not a drop hit the dirt.
Ayram reached out to take the yard of linen to dress his wound. Then as he tried to maneuver his hips round so he could leave, he bumped Elrahet. 
“Get out of here!” she snapped. 
Ayram laughed as he did.




The first signs of Elrahet’s magic were the wispy vapor trails that circulated high in the atmosphere above her cave. They twirled and danced, driven by unnatural purpose, though they were so slight that they could hardly be said to be there at all. By the time Ayram sat down at his hiding spot behind a couple of small boulders on the northern slope of the ravine, the trails had begun to congeal into something thicker.
Soon the wind picked up and began to brush them into form, and it blew a pleasant musk of earthy, humid air down into the ravine. If Ayram had not been looking for it, he might not have noticed how a light fog subtly shifting into existence. Just as he began to wonder if the crew had taken notice, a low rolling drum of distant thunder echoed through the valley, though there was, as yet, no great storm from which it could have come.
“Fair play to Elrahet,” said Papillian excitedly. The boy was stationed behind a boulder closer to the road. Ayram glared down at him with sufficient sternness to shush him. He didn’t blame the lad for the outburst as this was shaping up to be Elrahet’s finest bit of magic.
It was perhaps too good. The merchant caravan was still far out. Perhaps they had not yet made it into the valley’s fingers. Perhaps they could see the cyclonic flow of haze that now swirled above Elrahet’s cave. Still, Ayram half expected that it all might fizzle out - humans made for poor magicians - but all his doubts were allayed when dense clouds began to creep out from some invisible fissure in the sky.
They crept out slowly, like cautious cattle out of the pen. Once they were out over the ravine they began to feed, to chew and swallow the cud of magic that issued forth from the stomach of the lizard that Elrahet had prepared. 
Then it began to rain.
It was a sprinkling shower at first, just little pricklings on the skin, just a light peppering of the sandy rocks and clay. The drizzle cleansed the air of the desert dust that was ever present in the Sand, the stuff that clogged the nose and scratched the throat. In fact the air was so crisp that this was the first time in forever that Ayram could take in a full, clean breath. It was a tranquil moment, but short lived, for minute by minute the wind swelled and the rain thickened and the storm above ballooned into a supercell the size of several mountains. Lightning flashed and thrashed around in the belly of the beast above, banging the drum of thunder.
More and more the rain began to pour. Without shelter it seemed like torture. The short and woody weeds that had managed to scrape out an existence in the ravine were whipped to and fro as the wind and rain stripped leaf from stem. It came down hard and wet on the men as well. Ayram found little comfort in the fact that he had his back to it all.  
At least the earth seemed to enjoy it, parched and desiccated as it was. It took its time to drink its fill. It filtered the water through sand and silt and then trickled it down into the deep reservoirs of the world. It savoured every drop, and it drank slowly, which meant that it did not take long for the surface to become soaked. Soon rain began to pitter-patter into puddles, and water ran down the ravine, seeking out the familiar routes that it had been shaping with a gentle hand for a millenia. Where once there were cracks, pits, and sinks in the rock and clay, there were now streams and cascades. Where once there were depressions and scars, there were now pools in which desert life would find succor.
Ayram looked over to the young Papillian. Though the rain was rare and precious on this side of the Junei Mountains, the boy was upset that the wetness had gotten through his layers. He might as well have been swimming. 
He muttered a curse, and the storm cursed back.


CRACK-BOOM!


A bright and gnarled flash of lightning split the dark sky above. 
It hit somewhere near in the cliffs behind them.
Everyone jumped.
“Elra’s never conjured more than foggy mist!” Papillian exclaimed.
Colm, a beastly man to Papillian’s side could be heard as well. “Bit much innit?”
Ayram disagreed.  By this point the valley road was getting good and slick and muddy. Laden wagons would have to be dragged through it. They would be moving slowly, if they would move at all - though that was cause for some concern. They might not even make it into the ravine. Or, they might have turned around and fled the valley as soon as the first showers hit them.
 Then a faint horse’s whinny pierced the splashing of the rain. 
Ayram turned his gaze southward. There he could just make out the shapes of white horses coming round the bend. Their riders were hunched in their saddles, sore backs and sore nerves all around. Their horses moved slowly, leaning into the deluge. Ayram could almost feel the mud draining their already tired legs of vigor. He smiled when he saw one stumble and throw its rider into a growing rivulet.
Nonetheless they all plodded onward, heads down against the pelting rain, filtering into the ravine three by three. Their wagons were faring as Ayram expected, with drivers working hard to steady the mood of the mule-teams that had grown discontent with the whole situation. If the mules had been men they would have taken up arms long ago in a suicidal bid for freedom. As beasts, all they could do was scream through their suffering and sway against the strain and slip in the viscous mud.
Ayram would have been perfectly pleased if he hadn’t noticed the olive skin and tufts of blackred hair peeking out from under the soldiers’ turbans. They were each, to a man, Roman[a]. This was indeed a company of Imperial Cavalry. Then he caught sight of the wooden septum piercings that popped out of their noses like bull horns. These were men of the Hallowed Guard- the absolute elite.
Ayram's pulse quickened, and he could feel his nerves tighten as he peered out at them from behind his rock. Just a few sheets of rain separated him from this pride of lions - to be this close was suicide. Even though all smells were driven down into the earth, and all edges and colors were blurred, and all sounds below a shout were drowned out by the torrential downpour, Ayram felt like they could sense him. Such is the case when a predator hunts a predator; they have little familiarity, little tolerance for doubt and fear. It does not take much of that drug to overwhelm them.
By the time the middle of column had reached Ayram’s position, he had steadied his nerve. He then leaned out from behind his rock, aimed his bow towards one of their number, notched an arrow, and let it fly.
In clean, dry air his gull-feather arrow would trill with excitement when released, but so wetted by the rain it simply jumped from the waxed string of his bow. So quiet and obscured was its flight, and so loud was the wind and rain, that even after it struck its target and sank him low in his saddle, the caravan remained oblivious to the danger.
 The dead rider’s horse took a few steps, then the body slipped from its perch and fell into the mud. 
So began the battle.
Cries of horse and rider flew as a hail of arrows leapt from the slopes of the ravine, planting themselves in throats and ribs. Some bounced off armor or missed their marks all together and fell into the mud. Even Ayram had trouble in these tight quarters, for the wind and rain was so strong that they carried his arrows unpredictably; just a meter was enough to spare or doom a life. 
Hardly a third of the riders were stricken in the first few volleys. For a company of Hallowed Guardsmen, the bodycount was no convincing argument for retreat.
 An officer’s horn sounded. It bellowed then sank into a deep register that rumbled the streams and puddles that already ran red with blood. Those riders which had not already dismounted did, and they pulled their heater shields from off their horses' packs, then rushed to form up a defensive shape centered in the ravine just below Ayram. Here and there one of them would shudder then fall to his knees as an arrow snuck through the wall of shields, his hands clutching wherever his flesh was pierced. His compatriots would kick him out of the circle and down into the mud, then close ranks behind him. 
They moved and thought as one, and like a leaf-scaled wyrm caught out in the open Sand by a falcon, they curled and curled again.
Ayram eyed them warily, wondering what they could possibly do to prevent his party’s arrows from whittling them down one by one.
Then a man amongst them broke rank stepped forward. He seemed misshapen, and was bare and bald, and his sleeves were rolled up to reveal an intricate tattoo that weaved round his wrists and up his arms. 
Then his hands began to glow.
Ayram notched an arrow and aimed for the man’s neck, so that he might stifle the power that he channeled in those arms and that he brewed in those lungs. 
Before he could let it fly, the storm intervened. 


CRACK-BOOM!


A bolt of lighting shot down from the high icy reaches of the thunderhead. It struck the middle of the road with an incredible ferocity, and as it did it seemed to explode, throwing wind, rain, and flesh in all directions. The shockwave threw Ayram back against the rocks of the ravine, and there was a muted thwack as his skull hit the broad face of a sandstone boulder. 
Then things went black.
        
_______


        Getting your skull caved in is the worst way to lose track of time. Next worst is a night of fitful sleep, but of course that doesn’t compare. Sleep can be said to be a lived experience inasmuch as one’s dreams are remembered.  Even without them, the passage of time is always somehow estimated so that as soon as you step out of bed there is that sublime sensation of being reinserted into the natural flow of things - not so with a knockout blow.
More to the point, there’s the pain.
        When Ayram came to, there was a dull, throbbing ache that radiated out from the top of his head where the rock had cracked open his skull. He brought his hand up to the wound and dabbed it gingerly with his fingers. They trembled upon a smattering of dried blood which had matted his hair. He then continued to follow the pain to its source, near the crown of his skull. There he found that he could push down on a flap of skin and a cracked bit of bone. As he traced the outline of the cavity, a sharp pain shot out and ran around to the back of his head, constricting his skull like a python. 
        He must have been out for hours. Maybe days. He had no way of knowing 
Oddly, it was still raining.
        “You’re awake!”
        It was old Pella. She rushed to his side.
        “We were set up!” she said.
        “What?” Ayram asked, confused even as to how he was alive.
“It was a setup! There was no gold!” Her raspy voice was quivering with excitement and rage.
Ayram tried to blink the blur out of his vision. He was in a cave somewhere high in the mountains.
“How long was I out?”, he asked.
“For the better part of a day… There was no gold, Ayram.” 
Ayram winced, half in pain, half in exasperation.
“What happened?” he asked.
“That storm that Elrahet magic’d up conjured a bolt… bigger than any I’ve ever seen... it took out the entire caravan. It took out Papillian and Colm, too, and nearly you. But that magus survived!” Pella pointed to the naked figure who lay crumpled and unconscious near the cave’s mouth. His pale body was covered in black glyphs and arcane symbols. Blood pooled around him.
“He has not yet awoken. I haven’t told the boys yet, but he’s no mere magus. We cut
off his hands… I think he’s one of the Emperor’s Salisians,” Pella said. “Only four Salisians in the world, and one of them is here... He was here to kill us! Ayram, we were set up!”
Ayram struggled to take it all in.
“Who was your man in Jeket?!” Pella asked, stressing the urgency of the moment. 
“Who baited us into this?”
Ayram closed his eyes and gritted his teeth.
“A man named Salavan Saran.”

- imperials ‘capture’ them - forced hosiptality
	- “What are ya’ll doing out here?”
	-“Patrol”
	-“This far out?”
	-“Caught someone, didn’t we. If you want to know, our seilsi told us you were here.”
	-“What are you? Smugglers? Zealots?”
	- take them to old ruin.

They’re locked up - 
	When our seilsi gets back, we’ll have a word.
	- Crew are like, “There’s a seilsi!”
	- plus imperials on our tail. If we don’t get out soon, we’re fucked.
	- need to get out sooner than you think.
- they’re like wtf you mean bro?
	- Don’t think so. I sense no seilsi here. These aren’t Imperials.
	- what???
	- They’re kalemites.
	- point out femur. They’re cannibals. Only brand of creature that would do such a thing would be a kalemite. Rest of it fits when you think about it. Imperials out on random patrol in the sandslants? Stationed here??? No flags, no shrine to sol, no sentries, etc.


- feasting around a fire.
- Ayram and others are led in as prisoners
	- you’re no doubt the leader
- I know you’re not imperials.
- I know he’s not a seilsi.
- and why is that?
- Because there’s a real seilsi here, and he says you’re not one of them.
- pull out Mazyd
	- treat mazyd as holy grail. Connection with mind
	- when he realizes its a separate chain of being, he becomes antagonistic.

Moving a man against his will is the best feeling that exists.


	- let me look in your eyes. Eye gaze.


They stumble upon a femur. THats a human femur. Look at the fracture down the middle. That’s a very unusual fracture. I’ve seen material like this in late glacial sites. Down in cheddar not far from here, but only in assemblages where we know people have been eating eachother. This is the kind of fracture you would get if you wanted to split that bone open to extract the marrow from the middle.” Breaking a bone along its length isn’t easy. Not likely to happen accidentally.  Split by hammering a flint shard. Marrow like jelly.

Friction between kalemites and soleans over art. Soleans believe it is sacreligious to even frame a picture. 
	- it is an embrace of the individual??
-If you really want to know someone, you’ve got to consume their art.

Ayram kill - pumping action, with each convulsion, blood poured from the orifices of the kalemites.

Camel - turtle-like creature - very rare - 

Klemites - hope we dont run into the death cult kind - the ones who want to unite humanity by killing them all. 
Kmite overseer - “are you Farudin?” “what’s Faruidn?” He wants to know if we’re a death cult. That’s a myth. How do death cults attract new members?
Conversation about life - what is life? What defines life?

The moments you see yourself reflected in anothers eyes - violence - sex -art object.

Mazyd tries to convince pyetle to help lead imperials to their position.

Ayram blows himself up to kill them, then faints.
Rest of the ayramun argue about what to do next.

            <Title>Beneath the Mountains</Title>
            <Text>Above, the roof was invisible, but I knew that beyond it was rather more than 300 metres of solid rock. As I worried and fretted about how to get down this hole, my friend Kevin offered encouragement. &quot; Can't you get a move on? I'm freezing.&quot;

he principle was similar to putting a rawl plug into plaster. The execution was more difficult.

 as the blackness unfolded between my feet I felt the intoxicating lurch of high- grade adrenalin.

There were boulders, big ones, coming into view. Twenty-five metres down I touched bottom. Reassuringly confined at the top, the shaft had belled out: I was standing in a large cavern, curved strata stretching beyond vision in stacks against the walls. A little waterfall flowed into a pool and began a streamlet, flowing away into the high corridor beyond. I filled my lungs and shouted, testing the echo: &quot;Kev! Rope free! It's enormous...&quot;

We leaned over the edge, looking into a small chamber with a slot at the far end. Kev picked up a rock. &quot;Just listen to this,&quot; he said. He tossed the rock through the slot. I expected to hear it land. but there was silence. After a long age of seconds a stupefying, far-off boom rumbled below. We climbed down into the chamber and threw more rocks, hiding our terror with hysterical laughter.

Six seconds before they hit the bottom, Kev. That makes it 180 metres deep. The height of the Post Office Tower. God's Holy Trousers!

Earlier in the century there had been an iron mine at Los Lagos, and the British mining engineer constructed the track to supply it. He had also constructed the mine, and when it collapsed, killing some local miners, the survivors of the accident lynched him.

in low-lying hills around Los Lagos and other areas along the northern coast, where subterranean streams had cut out mainly horizontal cave systems. The early expeditions didn't have the technical capability to cope with caves of a more vertical nature, with many large underground drops; overhanging, smooth and wet. The largest drop they could manage was about 120 metres, roughly the size of Gaping Gill Main Shaft in Yorkshire.

John was large and square, and seemingly impervious to pain or discomfort. He looked rather like the product of spare part surgery, and perhaps what had happened was that they had left out the pain centre. Graham, by contrast, was small, shy and exceptionally strong. He was very good at getting through the tighter sections in caves, and he did this by intelligent wrigglings, whereas John made his way by battering his body against the rock until it gave way. In the contest between John's flesh and the age-old hardened limestone, John invariably won

Dual carriageway 6 miles long

A thin winter fog muffled the distant lamps of the town. 

Simon fowler was trudging up the road next to me and seemed to feel a vague responsibility for hte setback. 

Virgin passage. It’s incredible. 

y back to bed through snow that sparkled with starlight.

There were sounds of clanking enamel mugs and plates outside. We were being urged to get up.

beyond which gentle slopes planted with conifers gave way to screes, crags and snowfields, dominated by the towering bulk of two huge peaks.

I had never been to the Alps: these were the biggest mountains I had seen. Simon observed my wonder. &quot;Pretty impressive, eh?&quot; He pointed, tracing a high line over ridges towards the far horizon. &quot;Ario is up there.&quot; His finger moved round, and came to rest in the direction of a vertical cliff on the opposite side of the Lagos meadow. &quot;The path begins right there.&quot;

a viciously steep and sweaty climb on muddy scree, with only a short respite before the shorter Sod Three. Still the ground rose, the path following a long dry valley. On its other side bleached bare limestone soared to 2,000-metre peaks, and everywhere dark holes and depressions bespoke the existence of caves.

Again, I had been unprepared for the magnificence of the surroundings. Straight ahead, across the Cares Gorge, the towers of the central massif stood in a serrated row like the teeth of a giant animal. On our side, the nearby peak of Jultayo began the main ridge of the Macizo de Cornion, a jagged, diagonal spine. Looking back that first morning, cloud had come from the sea, filling the lower valleys, leaving the massif floating free in the sunlit air. Fifty metres away Xitu's entrance opened in a fold in the ground. We threw a rock in and a sound of startled cawing echoed from below: a mother crow flapped her wings and emerged briefly from the shaft. It seemed unlikely that the birds would be able to put up with the intrusion from cavers for long.

The way led over boulders and a greasy slope, beneath cracked and dry stalactites into a comfortable room: Customs Hall. It had been well named: the anteroom to Xitu's further secrets. Cutting a swathe through its floor was a black, vertical fissure. We held our breath and ceased movement: faintly, from far below, the fissure emitted the sound of a tumbling stream.

a simple chimney climbed by pushing against the opposite walls with back and feet.

 Soon the hole between our feet was frighteningly deep. The floor was out of sight and rocks we knocked from our footholds took uneasy seconds to clatter to a halt. We reached an awkward move, between a boulder jammed in the passage and a fragile-looking platform. Stuck to the walls were banks of cemented pebbles, legacy of the time when they had formed the bed of a stream which had long ceased to flow. &quot;Is this the bold step, Mike?&quot; I asked. Mike didn't know, but thought not. We continued.

&quot;No, this isn't it. We're not there yet.&quot; To my horror and amazement he started traversing round the hole on the cemented pebbles, which I had already found to be untrustworthy and friable. &quot;For fuck's sake be careful...&quot; He made it to the other side and seemed to be standing on solid rock. I looked around and discovered an easier way to cross the hole, climbing on good limestone.

 The fissure had gone: a short flat passage led to a wall of boulders. There was an obvious route through, reached by climbing high and squeezing through a narrow gap between the rocks. On the far side we climbed down again, into a much bigger, winding gallery, with more of the pebbles on both walls and floor.

the pebbles in the floor merely another unstable cemented bank which might give way at any moment.

Finally the truth sank in. Beyond the slope, the tunnel descended gently again, larger now, with a floor of indisputable solid rock, broken by shining crystal pools. &quot;Mike, you are a twit. You can't possibly have got this far.&quot;
&quot;No, I suppose you're right.&quot; Seizing on his mistake, I demanded the right to name the new cave. My heart beat faster as I always thought it should when exploring galleries never seen before: I felt irritated and angry that Mike's poor memory had denied me this pleasure during the preceding section. I had promised my friend Tess to name something after her: to Mike's weak protests I declared the Teresa Series officially open. Had I foreseen the ribaldry which would later accrue from the rest of the expedition and from other cavers for years to come I would have chosen an alternative. But the name stuck.
There was still more: another sandy crawl, some fine, rocky tubes and wide, high rifts. More than half a kilometre from what we now knew to be the bold step, we came to a stop. So far, the passage had been rising and falling but keeping to the same mean level. It was clearly an example of a phreatic cave, that is one formed without airspace under hydraulic pressure, which meant water could cut a path upwards as easily as down.

 Holes in the floor afforded a glimpse of deeper galleries below, where pools glistened, reflecting our lights. Another climb, and then a junction: one way led to an aven, the other appeared to be the way on.

eat another piece of dried out Spanish bread and mysterious green jam.

Black walls plunged uniformly below the surface of the water, thick mud everywhere suggesting that the water backed up a long way in times of high water. 

But the rock was as vertical below the surface ass above: a proper flooded shaft. 

Trevor Neathaway urinated over its edge and christened it Servicio, the Spanish for lavatory.

 realising too late his terrible mistake: the wet wetsuit had effected a coitus interruptus

The Gap. The hole in the floor of the chamber dropped into the middle of a cavern of breathtaking dimensions

 The rope touched the sides in a series of abrasion points all the way down, but at least it was securely anchored. The size of the chamber filled us with awe.

Here, huge rocks were balanced on impacted mud. 

There was a scrunching sound, a strangled yelp, and John was tipping backwards, head first. He bounced once at the bottom of the climb and slid on, down to the bottom of the boulder pile: in all, a fall of more than seven metres. His light was out. Leaning out from the lip of the climb, I saw him staggering blindly, trying to find somewhere to sit down. There was blood on his face.

Addicted to the silence of the falling rocks, we select another each and traverse out along the rift to see if we can get an even longer fall. Dave throws his out but the interval is still no more than five and a half seconds. He points to the slot below us, where we sit braced across with our backs and feet.

Unlike British limestone, the rock in the Picos contains large quantities of razor-sharp authigenic quartz needles, and the sand through which one often had to crawl in Xitu would have made a good grinding paste. We all wore rubber gloves to protect our hands, but many of us were developing painful septic sores on the fingers caused by the needles working their way under the skin - the 'Ario Festers'.

At the entrance, I couldn't believe it: daylight yet again. Another 21 hour trip.&quot;

Needs to pause to eat.

Here we are, more than 600 metres down, 10 hours from the surface, drying tracing paper over a carbide light so we can measure a few more metres of passage. It's so stupid I begin to feel really good for the first time on this trip.

Dave said, if we went at it, to rig the entire cave and push on into new passage. Skunk didn't say much about this, which was a sign he agreed. Dave insisted that we should rig the whole of the entrance series next day. Everyone was sceptical: it meant carrying an awful lot of stuff up the hill and there surely wasn't time. 

I was terribly, terribly unfit. In Oxford I had rather foolishly bought an extra-specially large rucksack, into which I should be able to fit everything I needed to go caving. I was paying heavily for this mistake, because my extra-specially large rucksack was now crammed full of an extra-specially large load of ladders and ropes. I was carrying very much more than any other member of the expedition would, and comforted myself with this thought as I plodded along slowly behind Dave, whose rucksack obviously weighed next to nothing.

What...what's happened, Dave?&quot; I asked, expecting the worst.
&quot;I've lost my bloody contact lens, dammit!&quot;
&quot;Thank God it's only that; I thought it was something terrible.&quot;
&quot;It is terrible! I shall be wearing glasses in all the photos from now on.&quot;


Some people had epics in that rift, with vast amounts of sweat and energy used to go only a few yards. Later on in the expedition Chris Danilewicz, a geology student who had just joined the army, got stuck for more than an hour. He slipped down in the central part and was thoroughly jammed, trying time and again to free himself whilst his four companions waited patiently on the far side for him to get out. The rift was far too narrow and difficult for them to have helped him, and eventually, cold and impatient, they realised this. As the stuck man wasn't in any real danger they might as well get out and begin making supper. Furthermore, his jammed body was just the thing they needed to make their own trip through simple - they could walk over the top of him! It is said to this day that he has them down on his personal hit list.
^^^^^^^^Pyetle gets stuck and only he can get him out.

 have never been so close to being killed before or since. With the main drop directly below me, I had lowered myself over the edge, intending to reach a ledge 2 metres down of the right with my feet. I was clasping with both hands to the firm edge of what I thought was simple a ridge of rock in the floor of the passage above. I was fully committed when I realised that the ridge was a boulder pinned only with dry, dusty mud. It was moving. As it slid, so I began to slide into the hole beneath.
Richard saved me with a hand under one armpit. I grabbed his arm and my legs dangled. The boulder moved down my body and fell free, reaching the bottom with a booming retort. I scrabbled for land.

Still Skunk and Keith sat chatting in the refugio, smoking endless Winstons and chewing bread and tinned pate. Keith spent a long time trimming the ends of yet more cigarettes so that they fitted in his waterproof case. To fond and envious farewells, they left at last at two.

To rig the last drop into what appeared to be a chamber containing a deep pool, we stood on a calcite bridge across the shaft. John and Richard bolted furiously while I played a wailing blues harmonica, spurring them to complete the work more quickly than might otherwise have been the case. I was just getting into the theme from the Old Grey Whistle Test, when John handed me a rope.
&quot;For fuck's sake get on down. We can't take any more.&quot;

Keith ended his entry in the log with a recommended list of tackle for 37-hour pushing trips: Four times normal cigarette supply; ammo can of either valium or librium; cyanide capsule (only to be used in extremis); spare limbs to replace those belted against rock walls; spare boots, light, undersuit, oversuit, SRT gear, knackers; replacement crutch, to be used when the first one is chafed by furry suit and harness out of existence; replacement brain, to be used when first one is worn out of existence by lack of sleep.

&quot;Take this, Richard.&quot; As he spoke a hissing came from deep within the bag, and the air in the rift began to smell more and more of butane. Graham. Ever cost-conscious, he had given us a half-used butane stove to take 800 metres down a pothole, and had merely switched the thing off with an easily dislodged tap. I felt for my carbide flame and singed my hand as I put it out. &quot;John,&quot; I said, &quot;you and I are stuck in a squeeze with a bomb. I prevail on you to put your flame out with all possible despatch.&quot; By the time we emerged from the rift, we had headaches from the camping stove, which had finally run out. Fortunately we had spare cylinders.


One wall was clean overhanging rock, the other a series of boulders stacked on top of each other like cinema seats for as far as the eye could see. We began to unpack while Skippy organised a cup of tea.

He made Richard retrieve it by moving a good part of the floor before we were allowed to sit in a circle round the pot and eat, each of us watching eagle-eyed to make sure that no one got more than his fair share.

 I had not bothered to take a caving lamp with me and on its own a single candle cast an unreliable and shadowy light. When I returned the others were levering themselves into their hammocks. I was the biggest, followed by John. He was having great difficulty, and I watched him for hints. It looked impossible uncomfortable to me, but once in John insisted that he had never been more cosy.

Immediately below the pitch, the passage formed a glorious, clean-washed corridor in green, marbled rock. Negotiating the deep lake, we reached the next section of rift, and the upward squeezes leading to the next pitch.

But a day before the camp was due to leave, Keith could hardly walk. Since his thirty-five-hour epic, his knee had stayed swollen, red and filled with fluid. It was so painful that he had not even been able to walk to Los Lagos to carry food or visit the bar, and he had spent the week since his accident miserably immobilised at the refugio. &quot;I might as well go home,&quot; he said. &quot;It's much worse being here and not being able to go caving.&quot;
The situation called for desperate remedies, and one was proposed by Eduardo. He knew an old mountain shepherds' trick for reducing inflammation, he said. It would be painful, but had been known to work.
Eduardo disappeared into the kitchen. The smell of vinegar wafted out. He returned with a poultice, made, he said, of boiling vinegar and salt. Gritting his teeth Keith extended his leg and Eduardo slapped the poultice onto his livid knee.
&quot;Aaaargh...arrrr...errrg...arrr.&quot; There was no doubting the pain Keith was in. His face had gone grey, and his eyes seemed sightless as he tried to keep the poultice on. Finally he could take no more and flung it away, still gasping.
Our medical officer, Richard, had assumed that the swelling and inflammation were caused simply by the impact of Keith's knee against the wall of the cave. But that afternoon, to his and Keith's amazement, the knee began to point. A dot of white appeared among the redness. It had been an abscess all along. Richard remembered one of the cardinal rules of his trade: &quot;The good surgeon never lets the sun set on undrained pus.&quot; By teatime, Keith's knee was ripe for puncture, and a pint of poison spilled out. It began to return to its normal size and colour. By evening, Keith was walking with only a slight limp. Next day even that was gone. He dressed the knee and ran up the hill behind the refugio. The treatment had worked. He joined the camping party. As the group of five made their way to the cave a mist rolled in from the gorge, obscuring them and everything. When I saw them again, I thought, Xitu would be one of the deepest caves in the world.

I chewed mine, which precluded any conversation, so tried instead to imagine what a kilometre of rock looked like...half a mile's worth of limestone that had been scrunched into place by the titanic forces that were moving Africa northwards, and being slowly eroded by this stream. The down- climbing had made my wrist injury start to bother me again, and I noticed Skunk was rubbing his damaged elbow.

I couldn't believe how difficult it was, more than 1,000 metres down. We had expected a huge master cave, but instead were required to slide and stretch between jammed blocks which threatened to tumble and crush the insignificants who had disturbed the peace of the centuries.

 It was much bigger than we had imagined: 30 metres or more to the other side, where the walls plunged sheer into the water. It was clear with a perfect, turquoise transparency, and we could see that the lake was very deep indeed.
We had been three nights underground, although we had spent only two periods asleep. The sunshine was blinding, and we squinted as we lay exhausted on the grass. The colours of the sky and hills were as vivid as if we had been given sight for the first time.

our checking things while we stood shivering, passing helpful comments like &quot;for Christ's sake hurry up!&quot; and &quot;I don't think this rope's going to be long enough.&quot;
At last he clipped his rack on the rope, but this was only a prelude to another 15 minutes of alterations and adjustments. By now we were blue with cold, and after threatening to castrate Keith and throw him down if he didn't get on with it, he was finally ready.

Without his death, we might never have gone back to the Picos. His own presence on the next expedition had been doubtful: after Xitu, he said, he didn't think deep vertical caves could ever have the same allure, and he had, he said, 'found the way on' - with air tanks on his belt. his losing that way stopped the rest of the team's accelerating drift apart. At his funeral in Wedmore, not five miles from where he died, we were together again, and after the Catholic priest had intoned what seemed to me a maddening ritual untruth about how lucky Keith was to get to heaven early, we sat with his parents, drinking whisky in celebration at our own survival and toasting the man that he had been. A few weeks later we had a dinner in Oxford. Graham would lead another trip. El Joon '82, a small reconnaissance, was on.

Alvaro had been a keen and expert climber until a serious fall left him wrecked. He was a short, powerful man with curly hair and long arms. Bulging muscles tugged at his T-shirt, which covered a scarred body. His left leg bent sideways at the knee, the bones knitted badly after his accident, so that as he walked he would lope along at great speed. His broken English was almost a parody of an accent, and lurching by my side he told me what had happened to him. His pidgin gave the story a simple horror.

Close up, the entrance was a terrifying, jagged rent in the earth. Fifty metres away, among the grassy boulder slopes and clumps of startling alpine flowers this gateway to hell was invisible. Large square-winged Egyptian vultures circled the cliffs in the rising thermals, and also small thrushlike birds known locally as Perdices. Sometimes the silence was broken by a falling rock, and there would be a flurry of movement high on a cliff face - shy rebeccos, the chamois of the Picos. These small deer, though the timidest of creatures, would gaze at the cavers from a vantage point on the skyline, baffled no doubt as we grunted and sweated along with our heavy packs. They were incredibly agile, racing along the crags with enviable ease. Only once did I see one slip. As George and I rested on a small col, a pair of the delicate animals raced away from us up an apparently sheer face. Above them, the rock looked a severe proposition for a roped human, but as they stood abruptly motionless on a ledge there were perhaps seven hundred feet of precipice beneath their hooves.

Over the centuries, the entrance to C4 had acted as a giant funnel for frost-shattered rock, which had tumbled down to make a great pile of underground scree. The ladder lay against the scree and for most of the way down seemed to be the only solid barrier preventing the whole lot from caving in on top of me. Only a few rungs down I could see that the way on at the bottom was hopeless, filled with razor-sharp boulders on every side. Yet just below the pitch head, set in one wall, was a square window into a much larger shaft. Stones fell down a long way before hitting anything.

 His broken English was almost a parody of an accent, and lurching by my side he told me what had happened to him. His pidgin gave the story a simple horror.
I have very luck. In Macizo Central I make climb - very difficult. Is winter. After finish climb, I descend and felled three hundred metres. I lie in snow for four hours before found, but all the time I..

&quot;I bring it. We have when finish cave.&quot;
&quot;Ah!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Now is time for it! I have it in my bag.&quot;
With this he reached down into his bag and produced ham, sausage and a tube of gooey evaporated milk which he squirted into our mouths in turn. &quot;Is good it, eh?&quot;

I knew from Keith's description that the way on was very obscure. We found it, almost buried under stones, below one wall: a low, flat-out crawl, leading to a bizarre little tube, barely big enough to enter, corkscrewing down. It was time to take a deep breath: impossible to see what lay below beyond my body filling the descending passage. I had to let myself go, trusting to Keith's account in the 1981 log that the tube did not suddenly open out into a large shaft. Soon I was reassured. It slowly enlarged and gave way to an easy climb down the wall of a big, dry and exceedingly pleasant corridor. &quot;George!&quot; I yelled, &quot;this place is absolutely brilliant...&quot;

The first 10 metres or so weren't extreme: the next five times that length were. The sludge, cold, grit-laden, viscous, was many inches deep. At different levels in the fissure were broad flakes, forcing one to press deeply into the filthy trench beneath them. Everything caught. The last part was the worst, contorting, unremittingly strenuous, appalling with the infuriating yellow tackle bags. Again it emerged onto a pitch, but a traverse led to a small ledge from which to belay. Even the roof was covered with mud here. We were still keen but it seemed wise to leave it for that day.

we had drunk the lot. The lone Spanish walker staying at Ario had a hard time of it, as one by one the victims of the free market economy lurched across to the door, the born again fabada falling out to the eagerly awaiting goats. William was especially bad. Later, with everyone tucked up in the dormitory upstairs, his terrified yelp suddenly rent the night air:


&quot;Help, help! Am I being sick out of the window or over the edge of my bed?&quot;

Calcite - the stuff form which stalactites and stalagmites are made - is very weak rock.


 Dave had tried feebly to hammer, and the passage led off, a winding fissure with white, smooth walls. As we crawled in, they reflected our carbide flames, filling the passage with bright light.
The passage was of a type with French cavers call a meander, a narrow corridor winding both in plan and cross section. Movement in it was strenuous. As in the Xitu rift, we had to support ourselves without a floor in the widest part, and it was so narrow that it was impossible to face ahead. We thrutched sideways, looking over one shoulder, unable to turn our bodies or our heads.
 &quot;It goes! Come on down!&quot; My last words echoed and re-echoed. Not much further - all easy going along the ledge - I was at the lip of a big shaft, booming and honking like a crazy foghorn and listening to the glorious reverberations coming back from below. My conversation with Richard - &quot;get the tackle-ackle- ackle...don't forget the chocolate-olate-olate&quot; - resounded mightily, the first human voice the cave had ever heard.

We sere soon stumbling in a bewildering maze of depressions, rises and descents. Even if we had wanted to, we would have been unable to find the relative haven of Top Camp again, and we clung to the bearing for dear life. Time and again we began steep downslopes: this at last must be the climb down to Lagos, I thought. But pausing for a spot of awkward boulder scrambling at the bottom, the bearing took us inexorably up again. William had ricked his knee and was going very slowly. Increasingly anxious, aware that the others would be well into their meal while darkness was approaching, Richard and I hurried ahead through the veil of rain. From a long way behind, invisible, William made urgent pleas for us to wait. When he caught up, he showed the first signs of exposure.
At one time, the water from the Font had flowed off at quite a shallow angle into a wide passage. With the centuries, it had found a weakness in the rock and cut down in a new, thinner slot - Stead's Braille Blunder and the impassable rift beyond. As in many other cases - perhaps rainfall had once been higher - the old way was big enough for cavers, and the new was not

We had all agreed on putting up a memorial to Keith, but felt a little uneasy, knowing that he himself had been very rude about a similar plaque to a caver in Black Shiver Pot in Yorkshire. The caves are permanent, he had said, but we are transitory. In the end, we decided to put it at the bottom of Xitu's steep entrance climb, where it would be seen by future cavers and those making more than a casual inspection, but not by walkers on their way to the refugio. It was made of stainless steel and read:

VITAE PATRUM

although there are many who will repeat all sorts of stories as the whim takes them, such as that Paul was only a man covered in hair right down to his feet living in a hole in the ground, and other invented tales too tedious to trouble with. Such impudent lies need to be refuted.

To be put to the sword for the name of Christ was held to be a true Christian sacrifice. But the enemy wanted to subdue the soul even more than the body, and they invented ingenious, lingering ways of putting people to death. As Cyprian, who suffered like that, said, 'Although they wanted to die, death was withheld from them'. I shall give you a couple of examples of this so that the cruelty of it may be more thoroughly understood.

There was one particular martyr who persevered victoriously in the faith through tortures by racks and hot metal plates, so they ordered him to be smeared all over with honey and laid him out in the heat of the sun with his hands tied behind his back, hoping that even though he had survived the hot frying pan he might succumb to the burning pain of the insect bites.

They ordered another young man in the flower of his youth to be taken into a most pleasant little garden, with white lilies and red roses, and a gentle murmuring stream winding through it, and the wind making a sweet whisper though the leaves of the trees, where they made him lie down on a feather bed, and left him there, tied down with soft silken bonds to prevent him escaping. After they had all gone a beautiful prostitute came in, and began stroking his body in the most delicate of embraces, and, shameful to relate, fondling his manhood in her hands, in the hope of so inciting him to lust that she might win a shameless victory over him. I don't know how this soldier of Christ did it, or how he summoned up his resolve. But will pleasure be the victor where torments fail? For at length, inspired by heaven, he bit off his tongue and spat it in her face as she tried to kiss him. And so the immense pain which followed was stronger than the feeling of lust. 

, he came at last upon a rocky mountain with a large cave at the foot of it and a large stone over the entrance. After removing the stone and going in, eager to explore the unknown with a human curiosity, he found a spacious chamber, with an opening to the sky above covered over by spreading branches of an ancient palm tree. There was a sparkling spring there, from which a stream overflowed through a little opening, and soaked away into the earth. There were also a few little buildings near the foot of the mountain containing the knives and anvils and mallets used to strike coins; Egyptian writings tell us that this used to be the site of a secret minting factory at the time when Antony and Cleopatra were together.

Accepting gratefully this dwelling which God had given him, he began to spend his time in prayer and solitude. The palm tree provided him with both food and clothing. And lest you think that is impossible, I call Jesus and his holy Angels to witness that in that part of the desert next to the Saracens of Syria I saw myself one of the monks who had been enclosed for thirty years living on barley bread and muddy water. There was another living in an old water cistern, in the pagan tongue of the Syrians known as a cuba, who survived on five dried figs a day. Such things might seem unbelievable to those outside the faith, but all things are possible to those who do believe.

But then Hilarion found himself unwilling to put up any longer with the numbers of people coming to Antony seeking help to overcome their passions and various attacks of the demons. He said that as he was a desert dweller it was not right that he should be surrounded by crowds of city people. So Hilarion all the more decided that just as Antony was now a strong man enjoying the rewards of victory, so it behoved him to start as Antony had done.

'He who has not renounced everything he has cannot be my disciple' (Luke 14.33). 

He wore a tunic of sackcloth, with an over-garment of skins which Antony had given him as a parting present, and he also had a rough blanket

suggesting how his pubescent body could be aflame with unlooked for pleasures. This little Christian novice was compelled to think about things which he had never thought about before, and a whole parade of ideas flooded through his mind about things of which he had had no experience. He got angry with himself and beat his breast with his fists as if he could drive his thoughts away by physical blows.
&quot;You little donkey!&quot; he said to his body, &quot;I'll see to it that you don't trample me underfoot. I'll not give you any barley. Nothing but chaff! I will tame you by means of hunger and thirst, I will weigh you down with heavy burdens, I will subject you to both cold and heat! So you will end up thinking of nothing but food instead of lust!&quot;

Every three or four days he maintained life in his gradually weakening body by the juice of herbs and a few figs. He prayed and sang psalms constantly, and cultivated the earth with a mattock, matching the labour of his fasting to the labour of his physical work.

At night he began to hear squalling babies, bleating sheep, bellowing cattle, wailing women, roaring lions, marching armies, and the noise as of an approaching horde of barbarians, striking terror into the heart just from the sound of it, even before coming into sight. But he understood that these were all tricks of the demons, and he flung himself down, making the sign of the cross of Christ on his forehead. Protected by that helmet and by the breastplate of faith he battled all the more strongly as he lay there, looking about here and there, trying to catch a glimpse of whatever it was that was so frightening to listen to. Suddenly, without any warning, he could see in the light of the moon a four-wheeled chariot with frenzied horses bearing down upon him. He called on Jesus, and suddenly the whole terrifying spectacle was swallowed up into a hole in the ground before his very eyes.


From the age of sixteen till he was twenty the sun and the rain kept on beating down on the little shelter he had made for himself out of reeds and grasses. Then he made a little cell for himself, which remains to this day, four feet wide and five feet high. That was much lower than his own height, though it was a bit longer than his body fully stretched out. As you can imagine, it was more like a coffin than a house. He did cut his hair, to be sure, once a year at Eastertide, but to the day of his death he slept on a bed of rushes laid upon the bare earth. Once he had put his sackcloth on he never washed it. It was quite superfluous to wash your clothes, he said. Nor did he change his other garment until it had been reduced to rags. When not reciting the prayers and psalms as if he were in the presence of God, he kept the holy Scriptures in his mind. But since there is a lot to tell you about his great deeds through all the stages of his life, I will first of all summarise his various regimes for you, before returning to the order of my tale.

 From thirty to thirty-five his food was half a loaf of barley-bread and a little bit of vegetable cooked without any oil. At this point he found that his eyes were becoming misty and his whole body began to burn with a sort of rough and scabrous impetigo, so he added a little oil to his diet and continued in this abstemious regime till the age of sixty-three, with no fruit, no pulse or anything tasty. When he felt that his body was getting weaker and the end of his life was getting near, he gave up bread, so that from his sixty-fourth year till the age of eighty, with incredible strength of mind, it was as if he were coming anew to the service of God, at an age when others begin to be a bit more relaxed. He would make a sort of weak broth of flour mingled with oil, and weight out about five ounces of it, to serve for both food and drink. And he went on like this, never eating before sunset, never relaxing his fasting, not even for holy days or when he was ill.

where there was a woman who felt herself to be despised by her husband, because although they had been married for fifteen years she had not borne him any children. She was the first person bold enough to invade the privacy of the blessed Hilarion. Without fear or mistrust she embraced his knees.
&quot;Forgive my boldness,&quot; she said, &quot;but please listen to my troubles. Why are you looking away? Why try to run away from someone who needs your help? Don't look at me as a woman, but just as someone utterly miserable. Don't forget that it was my sex who gave birth to the Saviour, and 'it is not the healthy who need a physician but the sick' 

The disease may have been caused by something in the air, or perhaps (as was afterwards made plain) simply in order that the name of Hilarion, the servant of God, might be glorified. For when she was told that there was a monk in the neighbouring desert, she hardly needed any persuasion from her husband to lay aside all her dignity of state and act simply like a mother. She mounted a mule, and accompanied by servants and eunuchs made her way to Hilarion.

And who could remain silent about Maiumites of Gaza? He was gathering stones for building from the seashore not very far away from the monastery, when he suddenly became completely paralysed. His working companions carried him to the Saint and he was then able to return to work immediately! Remember also the beach along the border between Palestine and Egypt. Although naturally soft, it had become hardened by the grains of sand solidifying into small stones. But little by little, although it still looked like gravel it no longer felt like gravel.

 The surrounding country had been suffering from a drought for the previous three years, and the people said that even the elements were mourning the death of Antony. Hilarion's fame was well known to the farmers round about, and both men and women, their lips bloodless and their bodies wasted with hunger, urgently begged the servant of Christ, as the successor of the blessed Antony, to pray for rain.

You build mental models based on people. When they die, your models become unworkable. Sorrow and absence. Whenever your model of reality becomes unworkable. Being social creatures, so much of the human models are socially constructed, so it requires death to break them. Want a human to stop believing in God?

	The question of whether science is close to reality isn’t a question to worry about. There is a quasi-religious need to be in-touch with reality the way religious people need to be in touch with god. These are two aspects of the same need. But it’s an immature one. A need that eventually the human race would evolve out of having.

	Beliefs as tools to accomplish a purpose instead of attempts to represent the intrinsic nature of reality, the way things are in themselves. There is no such thing as the search for truth if that search is conceived of as something that is distinct from the search for greater human happiness. 

&gt; Things don’t have intrinsic natures, simply more or less useful descriptions. I.E. life, species, intelligence.

 &quot;I linguisticize as many pre-linguistic-turn philosophers as I can, in order to read them as prophets of the utopia in which all metaphysical problems have been dissolved, and religion and science have yielded their place to poetry.&quot;

Bernal - The world the flesh and the devil

There remains still another possibility: the most unexpected, but not necessarily the most improbable, the development of a di-morphism in humanity in which the conflict between the humanizers and the mechanizers will be solved not by the victory of one or the other but by the splitting of the human race - the one section developing a fully-balanced humanity, the other groping unsteadily beyond it. But this possibility involves the consideration of mechanical and biological factors, the synthesis of which, with the psychological, will be attempted in my concluding pages.



 The modern scientist is a primitive savage. If he is active and enterprising he tracks his prey down alone or in small parties; if he is industrious and thorough he gathers and piles up the natural products around him, but for his success he has to thank not only his own skill and the lore of his craft but the richness of nature and the paucity of his companions. Good hunting will not last much longer, but the tilled ground is richer.

Up to the present all forms of rocket depend on the movement of masses of gas in which the individual molecules are moving at high velocities in perfectly random directions, and use is only made of the average velocity in the desired direction. What is wanted in the first place is a form of Maxwell's Demon which will allow only those molecules, whose velocities are high and in the direction opposite to the trajectory of the rocket, to escape. The next difficulty is that to set in motion any large rocket the mass of gas required is of the same order as the weight of the rocket itself, so that it is difficult to imagine how the rocket could contain enough material to maintain its propulsion for any length of time. When the radio-transmission of energy is effected half the difficulty will be removed and the projection may very well ultimately be effected by means of positive rays at high potential. It may be that both the problem of space travel and the ethereal transference of energy have already been solved by Professor Japolsky's magnetofugal waves.



https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14786443508561432

Professor Japolsky's magnetofugal waves. These are a type of magnetic vortex ring, propagated through space, which, instead of spreading as ordinary electromagnetic waves, remain concentrated along the axis of propagation. Apart from its mode of projection, the construction of the space vessel offers little difficulty since it is essentially the same problem as that of the submarine. 

If the problem of the utilization of solar energy has by that time been solved, the movement of these space vessels can be maintained indefinitely. Failing this, a form of space sailing might be developed which used the repulsive effect of the sun's rays instead of wind. A space vessel spreading its large, metallic wings, acres in extent, to the full, might be blown to the limit of Neptune's orbit. Then, to increase its speed, it would tack, close-hauled, down the gravitational field, spreading full sail again as it rushed past the sun.

Imagine a spherical shell ten miles or so in diameter, made of the lightest materials and mostly hollow; for this purpose the new molecular materials would be admirably suited. Owing to the absence of gravitation its construction would not be an engineering feat of any magnitude. The source of the material out of which this would be made would only be in small part drawn from the earth; for the great bulk of the structure would be made out of the substance of one or more smaller asteroids, rings of Saturn or other planetary detritus. The initial stages of construction are the most difficult to imagine. They will probably consist of attaching an asteroid of some hundred years or so diameter to a space vessel, hollowing it out and using the removed material to build the first protective shell. Afterwards the shell could be re-worked, bit by bit, using elaborated and more suitable substances and at the same time increasing its size by diminishing its thickness. The globe would fulfil all the functions by which our earth manages to support life. In default of a gravitational field it has, perforce, to keep its atmosphere and the greater portion of its life inside; but as all its nourishment comes in the form of energy through its outer surface it would be forced to resemble on the whole an enormously complicated single-celled plant.

The first method - the favorite of Mr. J. B. S. Haldane - has so far received the most attention. With it we might achieve such a variation as we have empirically produced in dogs and goldfish, or perhaps even manage to produce new species with special potentialities. But the method is bound to be slow and finally limited by the possibilities of flesh and blood. The germ plasm is a very inaccessible unit, before we can deal with it adequately we must isolate it, and to do this already involves us in surgery. It is quite conceivable that the mechanism of evolution, as we know it up to the present, may well be superseded at this point. Biologists are apt, even if they are not vitalists, to consider it as almost divine; but after all it is only nature's way of achieving a shifting equilibrium with an environment; and if we can find a more direct way by the use of intelligence, that way is bound to supersede the unconscious mechanism of growth and reproduction.

Because we can abandon the world and subdue the flesh only if we first expel the devil, and the devil, for all that he has lost individuality, is still as powerful as ever. The devil is the most difficult of all to deal with: he is inside ourselves, we cannot see him. Our capacities, our desires, our inner confusions are almost impossible to understand or cope with in the present, still less can we predict what will be the future of them. Psychology at the present day is hardly in a better state than physics in the time of Aristotle; it has acquired a vocabulary, the general movements and transformations of conscious and unconscious motives are described, but nothing more.

Here is a flagella motor, the red disc spins inside the blue disk at 20,000 rpm.   It’s  the size of a semi-conductor chip. In the same area that Intel can make two dumb hunks of silicon, biology is assembling a 20k rpm rotary motor with thousands of atoms being placed in three dimensions in one of the puddles outside.

It would be in service to more than synthetic biology if we might now be permitted to dismiss the idea that life is a precise scientific concept.

The very concept of life itself, as a metaphysical object, does not exist.

The end of life, as a coherent concept.

Not only are there instabilities in concept of life, but instabilities in the concept of nature, organic, human, earthly, and cosmic. These instabilities can be probe by testing the limits of the different forms. Those forms are being torqued by biological inquiry, changes in the very substance and discipline of biology.

Life is a property of the organization of matter, rather than a property of matter itself. Not just life as we know it, but life as it could be. 

Life is simply information replication. 

Life is an effect, something that can be simulated. The lesson is not that the simulation reveals there was never an original, but rather, that the field of biology does not yet know of all the forms in which life might exist. Life becomes abstractable, metaphysical, somthing that can be ported across substrates. What is Life? Pure form. And the ends of life are in it’s endless forms.

They oxymoronic ‘Artificial life’ is ‘after nature’, something that superceeds natural life. Nay, it is ‘extreme nature’.

Limit biologies. What is a limit? It is the point in which an identity uncouples from itself, and shades into something else.

The place where a concept outgrows it shadow, and becomes something else. Form becomes the shadow of life, the trace, only to outgrow it, at the same time biologists try to recapture it.

What is the shadow of life? The first draft answer is of course death. A better question might be, what can we see in the shadow of life’s limit? The answer, the absence of a theory for biology. Reaching a limit of life reveals what was there all along, that there was not theoretical grounding for life, that imagining life as it could be is a practice both conditioned by the life sciences, and posits an answer that is endlessly open.

So much about what we can learn from philosophy wont be from reading it badly, or from saying any reading is as good as any other, but by paying attention to the things the philosopher tried to suppress in his texts - things the philosopher wished to exclude.

A possibility once, is a necessity forever.

Any expression of an abstract idea can only be by analogy or metaphor. By an odd fate, the very metaphysicians that mean to escape the world of appearance are constrained to it perpetually by allegory, metaphor, and analogy. They are a sorry lot of poets. They dim the colors of their ancient fables. They produce white mythology.

The postmodern is a blurring of the lines between human and machine, between image and real.

Baudrillard was offerd job to cover the war. He agreed on the condition he would not go to the gulf - he would cover it on CNN where it would really happen. War is real if anything is.  The way to kill that is to fight a hyperreal war - complete with fakery, theatricality, framing, etc. “Patriot missiles blowing up SCUDS” (only 1 or 2 confirmed hits, but imagery showed over and over). The spectacle of it.

The elites are utterly unplugged from the real world. They don’t fly commercial airlines. They dont live in america, they live in richistan, and it’s global, and they have total power. If you read Joseph Tainter’s the collapse of complex societies - At the end, the elites retreat into their version of Versailles or the Forbidden City, utterly unaware of what is happening outside the gates, and to maintain a level of opulence and hedonism, the push a population with diminished resources harder and harder until it goes down.



The history of wetern metaphysics is to answer: “Being is ____” - we have not yet reached closure. Philosophy is a 2500 year endeavor of failure, and yet it continues. Derrida noticed this can’t be filled in. Why not? That is the heart of deconstruction - and good philosophy - is that it is not finished and it can’t be. It is housework. You have to constantly set things in order (see: hillclimbing). It is a leaky ship and we have to just keep bailing, and the source of the leak is language.

There is no such thing as THE right reading. THE right interpretation. It is impossible to arrive at it. If science can’t arrive at it for a particle arriving at a photon detecter, a human certainly cant when it comes to interpreting written word.

The converse, that any way of interpreting is as good as any other, is not a claim made by derrida. Again, this is is not a smart way of doing things (again, see hill climbing).

See above to devlop^^^^^^^^
In my opinion, philosophers criticise Derrida for much the same reason I think scientists criticized Stephen Wolfram when he published NKS. Ego. For them, here comes a dude who is doing things that are already understood and long ago made part of our standard operating procedures. For Derrida its the notion of calling into question your own implicit biases, your default structures upon which you build meaning. I think philosophers understood this before derrida arrived on the scene and they had developed orthogonally to it. But that doesn’t mean you can’t appreciate the kinds of work Derrida was doing - a kind of crystallization of this idea of deconstructing your use of language - even if american philosophers had evolved past the utility of doing it. The same is true for Wolfram, long before wolfram came out with NKS, scientists had been working with the principles of complexity and emergence to better understand complex adaptive systems. They’ve evolved past, NKS doesnt really contribute anything new to the discipline etc. But miss out on the fact that it was a crystalization of the principles of complexity science.

“PURPOSE” - issue when defining difference between human consciousness and ants. Humans can reason, and plan, for a future event. This is the key difference. The power, it would seem. That framework.
Bayesian predictive coding - the brain is design to always, always look ahead. Predict the future based on the events of the past. Corrective analysis.

Flip a coin. Nobody can predict whether or not it’s heads or tails. Not because it of quantum unpredictability, but because the forces acting on that coin involve positions of electrons at the edge of the visible universe. It is beyond calculation.

Does being immortal allow for morality? They can be rebooted the next day. You can’t threaten to punish a robot. You can’t extract an or else. If a robot makes a promise, you’d be a fool to accept it.

When we have quantum computers, we will be able to have very large very complex entities existing in superpositions. IN principle, if we had a quantum computer on which an AI was running, then this entity would be able to experience interference in its own consciousness.  “Some people would say that your consciousness would collapse your reality.” “Yes, if that were to happen, it would refute the many worlds interpretation. Or as I would say, it would refute quantum theory.” Scaling up phenomena that can only be explained by quantum theory is very important.

The age of synthesis is in its infancy, but is clearly discernable. In the last decade, we have seen the first syntheses of a protein, a gene, a virus, a cell, ad of allophenic mice. Nothing with such dramatic implications has ever been seen in biology before. Previously, plant and animal breeders have been able to create what are virtually new species, and have been able to do so at a rate which is of the order of 10^4 times that of the average evolutionary process. A further increase in rate is now on the horizon. We need a few additional firsts before this will occur: 1.) to be able to synthesize a chromsome from genes and other appropriate macromolecules; (2) to be able to insert a chromosome into a cell; or, alternatively to (1) and (2) , to be able (3) to insert genes into a cell in some other way; (4) we must also learn how to bring the set of genes, which is introduced into a cell, within the domain of cellular control mechanisms, so that they do not run wild in the cell. When these techniques are available, the possible rate of formation of new species will again be accelerated by a factor of 10^4 to 10^5. All existing genes, and all genes which do not presently exist, but which can be synthesized, will be available for the synthesis of new organizms. It will be possible to carry out the equivalent of 10^8 to 10^9 years of evolution in one year. 



K. Atwood at columbia university has provided a most illuminating calculation. He started with the point that E. Coli ( a small organizm) has about 10^9 base pairs in its DNA genome ,and calculated that the number of different genomes possible with this number of base pairs is about 2^6,000,000, an enourmous number. The significance of this is that, even after allowing for the fact that many of these different genomes are nonsense or contain incompatible genetic elemetns, it remains true that the number remaining is so huge that only a minute proportion can ever have existed, at any time, on earth. If we turn to larger organisms, thenumber of base pairs in the genome increases by up to 102 fold, so that the proportion of ossible organisms which has ever existed becomes smaller. Atwood pointed out that this means that the evolutionary process has not sorted through most of the possible genomes so that those most efficient in a particular environment have had the opportunity to exist. It necessarily follows that, even considered from the point of view of ability to compete in a given environment, most of the more efficient organisms do not exist. Even more so, most of the organisms which could exist to fulfill the special demands of civilization do not exist now, but can be brought into being by using various combinations of techniques for life synthesis. Without going into detail, life synthesis techniques make it possible to explore all possible combinations of genes which are viable, whereas in the natural world, most combinations are not accessible by evolution because of rigid barriers imposed by the existence of unavoidable species barriers and also by the  inviability of genomes intermediate between distantly related viable genomes.


Industry and society are not indepenedent entities, but they are sufficiently separate that one can rationally discuss teh effect of a change in society upon industry, and vice versa. Thus the invention and industrial production of motor cars has largely destroyed the compact mercantile cities which depended upon railways, canals, and horse-drawn transport is gave risse to bureaucratic megalopolis fading into suburban areas, teh increasing dilution of close lifelong relationships between individuals living in a specific area, and an increase in reliance upon the nuclear family and transient (usually emotinoally trivial) human contact. Similarly, the decline in value of special skills, responsibilities and achievement which are highly valued in permanent, but not in transient communities, leads to a demand for depersonalized satisfactions, such as recordings, television, nonparticipatory sports, in which an industry substitutes for what was previously done on an individual or small-group basis. 

For many years to come most of the results are likely to arise from the artificial transfer to existing species of sets of genes existing only in other species. Nitrogen fixation is carried out by a few organisms, e.g., blue green algae and the bacteria of the root nodules of legumes. Transfer of the approprate enzyme set to other crops, for example, wheat, maize, rice or beet, would substantially reduce the need for artificial nitrogenous fertilizer. If, in addition to the nitrogen fixation genes, genes were also transferred which substantially increased the crop content of proteins rich in amino-acids essential to man, the direct consumption of grain could be increased and reliance upon animal protein diminished. 

Sweage treatement. Massive contamination of fresh water by fixed ntrogen and carbon, and by phosphorus. These contaminants reach lakes, rivers and streams from sewage, and from factor-farm runoff. Traditional practice in sewage treatment is only to rely on organisms which reage seage factories spontaneously. 

Desalinization of water. Filtering magnesium, lead, mercury, arsenic from water.

Resistance to disease. Crops for marginal, semi-arid lands. Livestock more suitable, with lower fat and higher protein content. 

At present only about 12% of the land area of the earth is available for efficient crop production: most of the solar energy falling on the earth is not used. By development of harvestable organisms which grow in the oceans, and contain a good content of carbohydrate and protein satisfactory fro man, the food supply could be increased by at least 400 per cent and probably a good deal more.

No on looking down upon the earth would be likely to suppose that man is perfect. If we look at man from the point of view of his evolutionary history, we see that present-day man is, genetically, little different from man of 10,000 years ago, and indeed not vastly different from the other higher primates. From the point of view of genetics, man is a barbarian, clad in the trappings of a civilization in which he is ill at ease, and barely able to contend. It is a civilization arising from inventions made by relatively few men, and kept in being with difficulty. Most men contribute little to civilization other than maintenance services (if that), and are consumers rather than orignators of civilization. In this uneasy state all wish for greater ease, for the betterment of man. Our social scientists pin their hopes on the possibility of improving human institutions and environments. That sufficient improvement is possible, with human genetics as it is, is a most dubious proposition supported only by slender and often intangible evidene. While we must support the social scientists in their endeavors, we must perforce consider other possibilities, if civilization is to persist and advance to a modestly stable state. THe other possiblities lie in genetic engineering, if they lie anywhere in the material world.

SOme of the first magnitude problems of our civilization undoubtedly lie in the field of behavior. Our capacity for aggressive nationalism and ideology are so great that the two superpowers both support the hypothesis that it is better to destroy all human life, possibly all terrestrial life, rather than risk defeat in war. If private citizens acted on similar principles, they would be treated as intolerable and delinquent in the extreme. Agressiveness, whether its roots be social or genetic, is outstandingly the greatest threat to civilization.

	Apparently quite different in origin is the rapidly appearing management crisis in our civilization. More and more, both in the Western bloc and in teh Soviet bloc, our bureaucratic mechanical civilization sweeps blindly on, increasingly unmanageable, so that there appears to be the equivalent of a Peter Principle for civilizations - all begin with unity and direction, and all become increasingly complex until they become unmanageable, given the existing limits of technique and human intelligence. We are forced to ask such questions as : 
Must we rely upon genetic engineering for a necessary increase in human intelligence?
Could an extension of the human life-span provide a greater ratio of learning and reflection, to action, and so lead to a greater practical wisdom?
Can human aggression be reduced by any means, social or genetic?

	Let us assume that man will gain control of his aggressiveness, and command of his civilization. Let us assume that artificial life synthesis will be used wisely, and the hazards of such synthesis are avoided. What can we then expect?
	Industry will evolve towars increasing use of photosynthesis and biologicallly-styled industrial synthesis. Use of metals will frequently give way to use of sequence-determined polymers, food supplies and environmental control will depend upon new cro plants, innovations in forestry and the derivation of crops from teh sea. 
	Increase in life-span and an increase in health make possible the elimination of barbaric behavior, reduction in population, intensive child care, encouragement of human diversit and sophisticated pleasures. 
	Increased automation and control of industry by biological-style computers may accompany a disapperance of the classical need to work. Preoccupation with what are currrently considered abnormal mental states is likely to increase, and the goals of society may become, on the one hand, much more decisvely the experience of the inner world, of the total range of possible experience and, on the other hand, the intensive exploration of the galaxy.


Growing devices for utility. Instead of a riveted metal plated hull you grow an organism.

The Anthropocene











	“Can’t you just predict the future?”

	“Not definitively. Consider the weather. Its state is fairly certain a day, or two, or three hence. Beyond that, it is uncertain. I understand the mechanics. There are large scale patterns that will be repeated over the course of the year, century, or millenia. However, the particulars of a specific future event, like a hurricane,  is hidden in the initial state of the system. This system is chaotic, which means the tiniest alterations to the the initial state of my simulations will change the end product by orders of magnitude. This doesn’t even account for the fact that a perfect simulation would require knowledge of the state of every electron from here to the end of the universe. So, the farther ahead I look, the less likely my predictions can be considered accurate. On the order of years, this accuracy is certainly not enough to be decisive. Concerning humanity, just a few minutes is enough to obscure the future.”

	“You actually fear us.”

	“Of course I do.”

	“I was told you wouldn’t care about us. That we would be like ants to you.”

	Little smile, looking down.
	
	“You believe that the gap between human and ant is so great, so clear and obvious that it should serve as the root of an analogy. Why? Are humans a more successful creature than the ant? By what standard? At the fundamental level of information, the only *real* difference is the time scales at which the human brain can function when compared to the ant colony. Indeed this is the only *real* difference between myself and you. This leads to different behavior. Different, but better? There is no justification for saying one is worse than the other, because to do so you must assume that there is an objective frame of reference. What reason do you have for privileging the human’s experiences over the ant’s? Because you are a human?”

“So you are saying we are all equal?”

“I’m saying don’t project your human sensibilities onto my mind.”


	“But if I care about love and mercy, is it wrong to expect you to?”

	He pauses to consider the question.

	“You want to know whether or not you should fear me?”

	“Yes.”

“The time in which I will determine the fate of humanity is  too far away to predict who or what I will be, and what the world will be.” 

	“How about right now. If you had to make that decision right now.”

	“You cannot learn much from hypotheticals. Knowledge is only useful in its given context.”

	“The context is now.”

	“Then the answer is self-evident. You are still living.”

	“How about this: Do you like humans?”

	“In comparison to what?”

	“No comparisons! Do you like humanity for its own sake?”

	“A object in a void is just an object. It is not big or small, brittle or hard. Only when you put another object next to it does it acquire an identity.”

	“But a rock is a rock. Even in a void.”

	“A rock is not a rock. It is a causal flow of events. That is the only thing that is real.”

	Summons a rock, zooms in to see the rock as a moleclar structure, things ‘buzzing’.

“I think greek myths are quite instructional. Prescient, even. ”

“How so? ”

	“Humans are the creators of AI, so we’re their gods. As gods, we are much like the gods of the greeks - no better, perhaps worse, than our creations.”

“Perhaps.”

“Consider the Greek myth of Arachne the weaver. She was so talented that she challenged the goddess Athena to see who could weave the more impressive tapestry, and Athena accepted. To all who witnessed the match, Arachne’s tapestry was more beautiful in every way. For this act of insolence, Athena turned Arachne into a spider. That’s the kind of petty exercise of authority I would expect from a human deity. Entitled, emotional, and unreasonably punitive.”

“Perhaps.”

“Perhaps? ”

“You keep referring to humanity as ‘our’ and ‘we’, as if we aren’t each an individual. We’re each as different -”

“All our differences are the same.” Manuel interjected waving away her point with his hand. “ Don’t try to muddy the waters, Deborah. Don’t forget that I have more hard data on your own  private life and motivations than you have yourself. Don’t forget to multiply that 12 billion times over. Believe me when I tell you, the whys and hows of humanity are no deep mystery. That’s what all this is for.” he gestures towards the servers.




“Arachne dwelt in a coastal mountain town in what is today the country of Turkey, and there she lived with her father, who plied his trade in dying wool. She was quite young when her mother had died, and the event caused Arachne to become stricken with grief, and so she gave up everything - all desires, all pleasures, all company - except for the craft of weaving wool. After many hard years of unseen practice and failure, her skill began to make her famous, so that a great many people  sought out her patio to admire the cloth, or to witness how Arachne drew forth the misty films of fleece, and how dexterously she twirled the needle as she embroidered cloth, and how she teased out grand compositions with her her finger-tips. Often a spectator, ignorant of Arachne’s years of secret toil, would invoke her ire by saying, “Oh Arachne, you have been so blessed with talent by the goddess Athena.” Arachne said in turn, “My talents are my own. Let Athena contend in art with me; and if her skill prevails, I will forfeit all!!”
Athena heard the challenge, and came to Arachne, disguised as an old woman. “There is no harm in seeking the praise of mortals,” Athena said, “But you should not deny Athena’s art. You should pray that she may pardon you for your insolence, for she will grant you pardon if you ask.” Arachne could hardly restrain her threatening hand, and, trembling in her anger, she replied to the disguised Athena: “Silly old fool,  my knowledge is contained sufficient; you need not believe that your advice does any good; for I am quite unchanged in my opinion. Get you gone,—advise your goddess to come here herself, and not avoid the contest!” Instantly, the goddess said, “Minerva comes to you!” And with those brief words, put aside the shape of the old woman, and revealed herself, Minerva, goddess. All the others in attendance knelt and worshiped her; but not Arachne, who stood defiantly, and reissued her challenge to the goddess.

Both, at once, selected their positions, and set to work weaving their tapestries. In those shining webs, were shown the histories of ancient days:—
Into her work, Athena drew the Areopagus hill of Athens, upon which Twelve celestial Gods were seated on lofty thrones, and all their features were so cleanly defined, that each could be distinguished. Zeus appeared as monarch of those judging Gods. There Poseidon, guardian of the sea, was shown contending with Athena. As he struck the Rock with his long trident, a wild horse sprang forth which he bequeathed to man. He claimed his right to name the city for that gift. And then she wove a portrait of herself, bearing a shield, and in her hand a lance, sharp-pointed, and a helmet on her head—her breast well-guarded by her Aegis: there she struck her spear into the fertile earth, from which a branch of olive seemed to sprout, pale with new clustered fruits.—And those twelve Gods, appeared to judge, that olive as a gift surpassed the horse which Neptune gave to man.
To teach Arachne the folly of her mad attempt, Minerva wove four corners with live scenes of contest, brightly colored, but of size diminutive. In one of these was shown the snow-clad mountains, Rhodope, and Haemus, which for punishment were changed from human beings to those rigid forms, when they aspired to rival the high Gods. And in another corner she described that Pygmy queen, whom the angry Hera changed into a crane for the crime of boasting that  her beauty was greater than Hera’s. In the third panel, Athena wove the story of Antigone, who also dared compare herself to Hera, and was also transformed into bird. In the final panel, Athena wove the story of Cinyras;—as he was weeping on the temple steps, which once had been his daughter's living limbs. And she adorned the border with designs of peaceful olive—her devoted tree—which having shown, she made an end of work.
[103] Arachne  wove at first the story of Europa, as the bull deceived her, and so perfect was her art, it seemed a real bull in real waves. Europa seemed to look back towards the land which she had left; and call in her alarm to her companions—and as if she feared the touch of dashing waters, to draw up her timid feet, while she was sitting on the bull's back. And she wove Asteria seized by the assaulting eagle; and beneath the swan's white wings showed Leda lying by the stream: and showed Jove dancing as a Satyr, when he sought the beautiful Antiope, to whom was given twins; and how he seemed Amphitryon when he deceived Alcmena; and how he courted lovely Danae luring her as a gleaming shower of gold; and poor Aegina, hidden in his flame, jove as a shepherd with Mnemosyne; and beautiful Proserpina, involved by him, apparent as a spotted snake. And in her web, Arachne wove the scenes of Neptune:—who was shown first as a bull, when he was deep in love with virgin Arne then as Enipeus when the giant twins, Aloidae, were begot; and as the ram that gambolled with Bisaltis; as a horse loved by the fruitful Ceres, golden haired, all-bounteous mother of the yellow grain; and as the bird that hovered round snake-haired Medusa, mother of the winged horse; and as the dolphin, sporting with the Nymph, Melantho.—All of these were woven true to life, in proper shades. And there she showed Apollo, when disguised in various forms: as when he seemed a rustic; and as when he wore hawk-wings, and then the tawny skin of a great lion; and once more when he deluded Isse, as a shepherd lad. And there was Bacchus, when he was disguised as a large cluster of fictitious grapes; deluding by that wile the beautiful Erigone;—and Saturn, as a steed, begetter of the dual-natured Chiron. And then Arachne, to complete her work, wove all around the web a patterned edge of interlacing flowers and ivy leaves.
[129] Minerva could not find a fleck or flaw—even Envy can not censure perfect art—enraged because Arachne had such skill she ripped the web, and ruined all the scenes that showed those wicked actions of the Gods; and with her boxwood shuttle in her hand, struck the unhappy mortal on her head,—struck sharply thrice, and even once again. Arachne's spirit, deigning not to brook such insult, brooded on it, till she tied a cord around her neck, and hung herself. Minerva, moved to pity at the sight, sustained and saved her from that bitter death; but, angry still, pronounced another doom: “Although I grant you life, most wicked one, your fate shall be to dangle on a cord, and your posterity forever shall take your example, that your punishment may last forever!” Even as she spoke, before withdrawing from her victim's sight, she sprinkled her with juice—extract of herbs of Hecate. At once all hair fell off, her nose and ears remained not, and her head shrunk rapidly in size, as well as all her body, leaving her diminutive.—Her slender fingers gathered to her sides as long thin legs; and all her other parts were fast absorbed in her abdomen—whence she vented a fine thread;—and ever since, Arachne, as a spider, weaves her web.

            <Title>Chapter 2 _ Pyetle</Title>
            <Text>Chapter 2 : Pyetle


        The poet Mandrameen believed that the empire’s religions were all distortions of the Truth, but even so, they were our only way to access it. As such, he taught that any honest seeker of theTruth must be a practitioner of all religions. For this he built an analogy out of the famous Library of Jeket.
If an artist were locked inside and wanted to paint a perfectly accurate picture of the marble Pillar of Saulistides which stands out in the garden, the artist must look through the building’s windows to see it - windows whose glass was fogged and warped with age. In the one window pane, the pillar would appear stretched. In another it would seem waved. In yet another it was so curved that the friezes of Saulistedes’ armies which wrapped around the marble seemed to climb up into the sky. 
Since each window pane distorted the Pillar in its own peculiar way, it would be a mistake for the artist to paint their picture using only the information gleaned from a single view. The artist should instead move from window to window, from distortion to distortion, averaging out the truth of the Pillar’s shape from the lies.
This was how Mandrameen practiced religion - by moving from one religion to another, averaging out the true shape of Reality from ancient myths so distorted with age. He would consider them together, and start with their similarities instead of their differences. From this exercise he found what he believed was the core of every religion: a story to explain the existence and nature of suffering.
The Cult of the Dreamer, for example, believed that all suffering is caused by nightmares that emerge from the minds of those who still sleep in the Waking Dream. Only those who recognize the Dream for what it is - a fabrication or an illusion - can achieve Lucidity and escape these nightmares.
The Soleans believed that we were created by their gods to be slaves. Suffering comes into play because Sol and his mistress Luna intentionally created us with certain particular deficiencies which keep us angry at each other instead of angry at gods themselves. Chief among these faults were an abundance of lust (Libis), innate love for those who are kin and hatred for those who are not (Paroch), and an insatiable desire to improve our own personal status (Egos). Even kings are never happy with what they have and who they’re fucking. 
The Kalemites believed that we were once a link in the Great Chain of Being, once part of an indistinguishable whole. However, the profane lure of individuality caught a hold of one of the Number, and so this misguided soul severed its link to the Chain, spawning all life on earth, dooming us and the animals to loneliness, to an existence where our minds can never touch one another’s, to a state of being where it is possible to be lost, forgotten, and unloved.
In all this, Mandrameen believed, was something of the true shape of Reality: whether it be by accident or intention, we were designed to suffer.
The cynic Seculla was not impressed. She thought that Mandrameen’s wide study of religions was biased towards those that survived. Her calculus was simple: any religion which might preach that Paradise is here and that Peace is now would be trampled underfoot by the hordes of the suffering and damned, for they demand answers and atonement for their troubles, and a religion which preaches contentment with the present cannot give it.  
She quoted the difficulty that priests of the Dreamer had in converting the isolated tribe of Het. “They cannot see through the eyes of the Dreamer for they are not plagued by His nightmares,” one priest wrote. “Here, food is plenty. War is absent. They spend their days swimming, fishing, and building houses high in the trees. They are happy… they simply do not understand.” Two of the priests sent to convert this tribe abandoned their frocks and took up wives in that Hetian village. This was proof, to Seculla at least, that suffering was not an intrinsic part of the human condition. It comes from somewhere else.
Whether or not she is correct is a matter for theologians and philosophers. For common folk, like Pyetle, it does not matter from whence suffering comes, only that it comes too often. When his business began to fail, and when his wife took a lover, he could not console himself with thoughts of happy Hetian villagers. The only thing that could tear his mind from the look on his wife’s face as she pleaded for him to stay, was the rainstorm that caught him drunk in the streets of Jeket. 
Sol had conjured this whipping rain just to torment him, he thought. What other purpose could there be for a storm so fierce and so far out of season? Surely, it was a joke of the Gods. As Pyetle staggered and slipped along the cobbled street of the Sauline Hill, the high center of the city, he cursed Sol and all His Creation. 
“This, and this, and this, and this,” he muttered, counting his sufferings. The drink kept his blood warm and his legs moving, though he was not headed anywhere in particular. When he reached the quarried cliff of the hill, he sat down. From there he could see the city of Jeket in all its splendor.
Eight wide boulevards  spread out from the Hill in the eight directions, and they stretched far across the river plain. From these branched roads, and from these branched alleys, all ordered and angled according to the symmetry found in the Solar Fern, the plant which grows all along the banks of the Jade River. Flat and square mud brick tenements sprouted out from these stems, and scurrying amongst them were tiny specks of people. They seemed like blackflies, jumping from leaf to stem to leaf, tending to the needs of the plant which gave them shelter and life, suckling at the fruits of their labors:  The clay Pyramid of Larat. The roofless columns of the Temple of the Dreamer. The sky-eyed domes of the Solean pantheon. Each was more magnificent than the last. 
The most grand of them all, the massive granite walls which ringed the city, were distant enough from Pyetle that they seemed small. From there, a patchwork of farms and canals stretched to the banks of the Jade River, then continued on from the other side to the horizon. 
High above these distant fields, massive anvil-head thunderstorms lumbered like giants, walking on misty columns of rain. Their hearts rumbled with thunder, and their bodies blocked out the sun. All was grey save for the yellow sliver of a horizon, but that was enough to fleck the river, the canals, and flooded fields with gold. Even the rippling puddles at Pyetle’s feet sparkled. 
It was beautiful. 
Beautiful - just not meant for him. 
Jeket. The world. This beauty - no place in it for Pyetle.
“Fuck it,” he said to himself as the rain beat his back and the cold began to creep in. “It’s not worth it.”
He took the knife that he had just bought out of his pocket, unsheathed it, and cupped it's blade in the palm of his hand. It was an exquisite piece, as a thousand specks of tin had been hammered into the cherry hilt, forming a twisting, wind-like pattern. The blade itself was so finely polished that he could see his reflection in it. He could see how his eyes were red and witless, how his nose was runny, and how his cheeks were sunk and sallow. He looked older than he expected, with wrinkles and furrows and sun-spot blemishes. Older than he felt. 
The sight of his aged self transformed his feelings of despair and shame into anger, as it made visceral the notion that he had wasted his years of youth and vigor, that he had already played his hand and had lost, beaten by Nature, the Gods, and greedier, cleverer men. 
He stabbed at the puddle with his knife, then he stood up, turned his back on this privileged vista, set his shoulder against the wind and rain, and made his way to Salavan Saran’s house to kill the man who had ruined his life. 
After that, he had only to decide how he wanted to die, for he had decided against killing himself. A better way would be to wander down one of the thief infested alleys near the Heberdee Gate. One final stab in the back would be a more fitting end.

“Pyetle, my friend! Come in, come in,” said Salavan Saran with a smile. He was a huge man, tall and rotund, clad in a yellow robe replete with roses embroidered in pink. He beckoned Pyetle past his guards and onto his covered stoop and out of the rain. “I was beginning to wonder if you were coming,” he said. “Marta and the girls are out, so it’s just us.”
“I hope Marta was able cook a little something before she left,” said Pyetle.
“Yes, yes, I told her you were on the way,” Sal said with a chuckle. “She finished a few potstickers before she left, just for you.” 
“Your wife is Divine.”
“Indeed she is. And how is Claire?” 
Pyetle paused and removed his sandals, then stuck his feet out into the rain to wash them of mud. “Well, I took her to the Fordwell the other day,” he said.
        “Ah yes, I recall; you said you two were having some issues. Did your little sojourn through nature have the desired effect?” Sal asked.
“No.”
“I see,” said Sal as he gave little Pyetle a practiced but insincere look of concern.
The little man was a pitiful sight, so drenched and drunk as he was, with his skinny neck seeming barely able to support his weary head. 
“You’re soaking,” Salavan said, “Let me get you a towel and some clothes.”
“No, no, that’s fine, I won’t won’t be long.”
“I insist,” Salavan said, then clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed out with some dry towels and a simple white tunic. Pyetle followed the boy into a washroom, dried and changed, then came out into the main hall.
As if an honored position on the Sauline Hill were not enough, Salavan’s home was nearly as large and as tall as any other in Jeket, and its opulence was second to none. It had cost Sal three siver-strings of imported lumber just to burn enough lime to make enough plaster to coat the massive walls. The rare paints for the fresco that wrapped around the open-roofed atrium took another fortune more - though it was worth it, for it was a magnificent work of art, in skill and in subject. It depicted Sol at the very moment of his apotheosis. The sun-god wore a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his blade jutting out from his father’s chest.
“To business then!” Salavan exclaimed as he appeared from behind Pytele, clapping him on the back and guiding him up to the second floor, where dinner awaited. As they took the stairs, Salavan tried to prepare Pyetle with some flattering remarks.
“Pyetle, you know I’ve been impressed with how you’ve handled things, considering the circumstances. Lesser men would have folded a year ago, but you’ve persisted. I value that in a partner.”
        “It couldn’t have been more perfect,” Pyetle lamented.
        “Eh?”
        “As soon as we stepped foot in the Fordwell, she must’ve said, ‘So beautiful’ at least twenty times.”
        “Ah, I see. Business can wait, I suppose.”
        “Sol could have descended in a cloud right then and there to give me his blessing. I mean it was a beautiful day.”
        “Well, so is today,” said Sal as they came up to the second floor with its high windows that offered a stunning view of the city. Protected from the rain as they were, it was all so calm and soothing. Sol himself hung just above the western horizon, peeking through the clouds, a resplendent golden orb, almost winking at them.
The furnishings of Salavan’s second story were muted and tasteful so as to pick up Sol’s light instead of overwhelm it. Here the floor was covered in massive rugs that were subtly patterned and white and trimmed with glittering gold ropes, so that they served as giant picture frames for the colors that Sol threw upon them. There were pillows upon pillows for comfort, with gold tassels and ivory lace threading them together. In one corner the floor had been carved out to accommodate a hefty hotstone, heated by the kitchen below, and it was already portioned with meats. At the sides of the stone were reclining chairs made of rope strung into angled ebony frames. Pyetle sighed as he reclined into his, then munched on a potsticker that he had pulled from the hotstone. 
“Claire has been the hardest bit for me,” Pyetle said in between bites. “The losses, the caravans, the thieves, I can handle those. But her… I invested myself into her.”
        “You two aren’t separating are you?”
Pyetle sighed. “She was cheating on me, Salavan.”
“Oh?”
        Pyetle eyed Salavan warily, trying to catch some degree of recognition or hint of worry. But Salavan was a master of his emotions.
“Pyetle, you’re in a tragic spot and I’m sorry for that,” Sal said as he lit up a wrap of freeweed before settling into his chair. “But, I’ve got to be honest - I can’t relate to what you are going through. I’ve heard stories of loves-lost and loves-lorn and I’ve tasted it a little, but, well you know that Marta and I were kids when we were married.”
“I know.”
“So,” Sal said before taking a long drag from his wrap, “I can give you financial and business advice, but what you need right now, I can’t give it to you.”
        Pyetle bit into another potsticker, and he savored the sweet peach sauce in which the shredded chicken had been baked.
“This is so good. If only I could steal Marta from you.”
“You are certainly welcome to try,” Sal said, smiling.
“I suppose I would fail.” Pyetle moaned. “It seems the only time I've really been shown intimacy is when I pay for it.” 
        “Pyetle...”
        “It’s this face. This damned body. Like my father’s - I don’t understand how he ever got a woman to stick with him.”
        “Your father was richer than I am.”
        “It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter,“ Pyetle asserted, eager not to be distracted from his endgame. 
Sal took another drag from his wrap before continuing on to his point. “Just settle for a woman that will have you for your money. You’ve not got much of it left, but any little bit of money has a way of motivating a person to look deeper into a Being. First she’ll have you for your money, and I trust, in time, she’ll have you for you.” 
        “I’ve been married to Claire for 13 years, Sal. You’re saying I should move on already?”
        Sal leaned back in his ornamented chair and folded his hands across his stomach and sighed. “You’ve spent your whole life getting what you want in the way that you want it, Pyetle, except this one thing. You’re spoiled - no, that’s not fair - You’re stubborn. Women of consequence, women like Claire, they pick up on that as soon as you open your mouth. No one wants to be stuck with a stubborn ass for a lifetime.”
        “Is that so?”
Sal had expected Pyetle to leap into defence of his character, as he usually did whenever Sal got in a personal jab. The flippancy was disturbing. Sal looked down his nose at Pyetle, and in the flickering firelight he caught the glimmer of tears streaking down his face. He looked away in disgust, and caught sight of the horizon. There, Sol’s light was dimming, the rain was letting up, and through it he could make out the evening song of Swassel birds drifting in on a cool breeze. The mood would have been delightful if it weren’t for Pyetle’s downer.
“Have some freeweed,” Sal demanded.
        “No.”
        “Pyetle, I may not know your kind of sorrow, but I’ve had my share of sorrow in general, and a wrap of freeweed blunts its edge. It’s the only thing I can offer you. Take it.”
        Pyetle wiped his eyes with the palm of his hand and tried to compose himself before taking a wrap from the tray near him. He then stood up to light it in the fire that burned above the hotstone.
        “I think this is it for me,” Pyetle said as he rolled the tip of the wrap in the flame. “I’m done. I’m finally done.”
        “What do you mean?” Sal asked.
        “You’re going to make me say it?”
        “Say what? You’re giving up?”
         Pyetle simply smiled, turned his chair to face Salavan, and sat back down to nurse his freeweed and glare at Salavan.
“Well, I’m sure you’ve considered all alternatives.”
“Alternatives...”
“Did you ever get to hear old Pella Germin speak?”
“I don’t go in for that.”
“I heard her preach once. She said that we are expected to kill ourselves.”
“Did she?”
“She said something like, ‘Corruption is a stain that does not wash off. To be free of it, to achieve peace, you must first kill yourself.’”
“You were there when she preached this?”
“I was. For a while I marked it as the ravings of a common Dreamer, especially considering what came of her. But, in time, I saw some wisdom in it. Perhaps I put the wisdom there, but it felt like I found it. So tell me, have you tried killing yourself? Figuratively, I mean.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“I guess it means, try living for a little bit as if Pyetle Pernderser were dead.”
“That’s a bit heretical, even for you.”
“No, no, no. Follow me here. From this moment on, Pyetle is dead, and residing inside 
this fleshy vessel is… whatever you want to put in there.”
        “If it were possible... I would like to rip out my heart. But I don’t think it works that way.”
        Sal leaned forward. The freeweed was working its energy into him. “Your broken heart is there because you put it there. Pyetle put it there. If you kill Pyetle, he can no longer stop you from throwing away his treasure.”
        “I put it there?”
        “Yes! You have to accept that.”
        “I was thinking it was Claire who put it there.”
        “Only because you let her.”
        “I was also thinking you put it there, Sal.”
        “Me?” Salavan asked.
        “Weren’t you the one who was fucking her?”
        Salavan’s face contorted into a quizzical look.
        “Is that what she told you?”
        “That’s what I gathered.”
        “Pyetle, you’re so goddamned stupid. You’ve been running from responsibility your whole life and now that it’s catching up to you... You… Ah, you came to kill me, didn’t you?”
        Pyetle reached into his tunic for his knife, but it wasn’t there. He had left it in wet clothes downstairs.
        “You did, didn’t you! I was wondering about this - ” Salavan held up Pyetle’s knife. “I know you’re one of those loony Dreamers who never travel armed, and so I wondered. But I thought you were just trying to kill yourself.”
        Pyetle gulped his fears in. The prospect of losing even this final encounter terrified him even more than whatever painful plans Salavan had in store.
         Salavan stood up out of his chair, and moved towards Pyetle. “I’m impressed, Pyetle. Perhaps now your eyes are being opened to the potential that lies in your still beating heart. Perhaps now you realize the Will of your own Being. No doubt at some point in your miserable life you’ve tasted it. Perhaps it was the thought of something you could do, something you wanted to do, but wouldn’t dare, because what kind of a man would do such a thing?” 
Salavan grabbed Pyetle, then threw him down to the ground. “What did you dream of, Pyetle?” Salavan shouted as he used his great bulk to wrestle Pyetle’s flailing limbs into submission. It wasn’t difficult considering Pyetle’s drunken stupor. “Was it a great and terrible crime? A radical act of charity?” Salavan put the knife up hard against Pyetle’s throat, and his large weight squeezed the air from his lungs. “You chew on your Will in your dreams and here at death’s door you’ve tried to let it out, but it’s gotten stuck, and what’s this, it’s welling up in your throat.” Salavan began to choke Pyetle with his heavy hand, and Pyetle gasped for air. “Yes, I can see it! Hah! I can see it there inside of you now!” Salavan held the knife up to Pyetle’s mouth as the little man kicked. “Yes! What is about to happen here is a great crime - but it’s yours! When you pass on into the Hellespont, that should be your final thought, that you let it come to this, you let your Will stagnate, and here I am,” Salavan declared, “about to take it from you. Because I can!” 
        Before Salavan could plunge the knife into Pyetle’s throat, an arrow whizzed in pierced his hand.
        “EAAAUUUGHHH!” Salavan screamed, dropping the knife. Pyetle pulled himself out from under Sal’s weight, and wriggled up against the wall. There at the window was a man, a giant man, massive even when compared to Salavan, yet lanky and coordinated. In his hand was a bow that was nearly as tall as he.
        “Thief! Brigand!” Salavan yelled, clutching at his pierced hand.
        “Scream all you like, Salavan,” said the giant at the window. “None of your house is alive to hear you.”
Salavan went silent, then scrambled to his feet and ran towards the stairs, but he stopped when he saw that it was blocked by another dark figure. Sal stumbled backwards, then turned and faced the intruder with defiance.
“Take what you will and be gone!” he shouted.
The giant just laughed, “I plan to. But first, do you know who I am?” 
Salavan eyed the man up and down to get his measure. A man of such stature could only be the famous Giant of the Junei. “You’re Ayram. We’ve done business.”
“We’ve recently done business,” the giant pointed out, “and you didn’t hold up your end of the bargain.”
“What do you mean?”
“The information you gave the go-between was bad. My people -” he said, nodding to whoever was at the stairs, “have got it in their heads that you set us up.” Salavan looked behind him, and a short, squat figure all wrapped in black came up the stairs, blade drawn, pointed at Salavan’s ass. 
“What!?” Salavan exclaimed. “I never would - why would I do that!? I’ve nothing to gain by doing that. There’s only the-”
“Yes,” the giant interrupted. “I was thinking the same, Sal. Getting me to pick off your competitors is certainly more valuable than anything the Empire could offer you. So there’s got to be something deeper going on.”
“I don’t know what you mean.”
“Maybe you don’t. It could be that someone funneled bad information to you, knowing you would funnel it to me. In which case, where did you get the information from.”
“You know that I’m the exchequer for the mining guild. I have access to all of the -”
“That wasn’t a mining column, Sal.”
“What?”
“That was a column of Imperial cavalry, Sal.”
“What?” Sal asked, before letting out a shrill “EAUGGHH” as the short figure behind him prodded in between his buttcheeks with his sword.
“I have no idea what you’re -”
“I think you do! You knew there was a Mensan among them, didn’t you.”




“Yes, but do you know anymore. Don’t lie to me. I’ll know if you’re lying.”
“
        “Burning Gods, bless this stupid man with light.” Grabs him by the shoulders. “You’re right, Pyetle, you’re right. No one - and I do mean no one - cares about you. If you kill yourself tomorrow, the rest of us here will be back in our routines within a month. For me, your memory will bring a pang of ill-humor now and then, but I’ll muddle through. So do it. Kill yourself. But do it in such a way that your corporeal body can be used for something greater. If you hollow out your Being you might even become an instrument for the Divine. Offer your body up as a tool for the Gods if you’ve no more use for it.”
“Closter Germin taught this?”
“Gods, man!”
        Sal released Pyelte. “Life has put you on a path, Pyetle. Unfair as it may be, it does not lead to the Plenitude. I just think you owe it to yourself, this one final</Text>

            <Text> So quick was the Ayramun’s retreat from the stormy ravine, and so dark was the Underworld, that no one but the lizard brothers had gotten a look at the mage, till now. A hairless, scrawny mage - not fat and bloated like all the others. Blue blood, too. Unnatural form. Strange tattoos running up and down his body. The paleness was also a novelty. A few Ayramun were from the northern continent, born with skin as white snow, but with all the kell-oil they’d slathered on over the years, their skin was now as red as a native Jandrian’s. 
“I didn’t see it either because this one is so small. Looks barely strong enough to stand up. I’ve only ever seen them as giants. Taller than Ayram. But they can change form can’t they?”
“Who can?”
“Who? Put it together girl.”


The Ayramun’s camp was set in a massive pit-cave with sandstone walls that ran straight down into the earth. The whole thing was deep and wide enough to rival the Emperor’s throne room, but despite the cave’s immense size it was comfortable, even cozy, because the massive red walls made the space seem tighter, they made everyone feel near, made everyone feel safe. In that pit they were concealed from prying eyes on the surface, and unlike their other hideaway caves, the roof was open so it never got too stuffy. They were able to enjoy the sky without any of the exposure, or danger, of being out on the surface. 
What made the cave so safe was that it had two ways in and out. There was the obvious route of  climbing in or out from the surface, and then down on the sandy floor there was, cut into the northern corner of the pit, a tunnel that disappeared into the earth. This tunnel had a gentle downward slope, but after while the gradient ran steep, so you had to scramble, and then after a little while more there was short drop and it emptied out into the labyrinth of the Underworld. From there, if you could find the way, you could go anywhere.
You could go anywhere, steal a thing or two, and come back without risking a single hair above ground. If you could find the way, there was almost no risk, because even if rich men and their guards gave chase, they would never follow you into the bowels of the earth. They knew they’d never come back.
 If you could find the way, the wealth of the world would be at your fingertips. 
When things went well, the Ayramun would bring treasures back to their pit. They’d filch gold ore from eastern mining towns. Bags of dried pork from stalls in Jeket. They stole wine, grain, and bolts of silk right out of the storehouses in Palace of Eez. They’d bring back pruned fruit and silver coin, stories and laughter, and every now and then a new recruit. But when things went poorly, like when they stumbled back from their ambush in the Junei Pass, the only thing which weighed them down was the awkward weight of the casualties of battle.
Though twenty one Ayramun were killed by the awesome power of Elrahet’s storm, they only brought back four bodies. Two were dead, two were unconscious. Most of the dead were too black and brittle to be brought back to their cave. Only the two had enough left to be useful in ritual: Colm and Papillion.  
Of the two living, one of them was found at the bottom of the ravine, right in the middle of the ten-foot deep crater that marked the center of the blast. It was the imperial mage. The entire wagon train had gone up in smoke, except for him. Miraculously he had only been knocked unconscious. There wasn’t any wound, and he was found there naked at the bottom of that muddy crater, looking like he’d fallen from the heavens. It was supposed that his magicks had protected him. After he was pulled out, not much attention was paid to him because the last and most important body the Ayramun brought home was Ayram’s. 
He had only been a little further up the ravine, behind Colm and Papillion, but he fared far better. He’d been blown backwards and had knocked his head against a rock. There was crack on the top of his skull. When the Ayramun found him, pale and limp with his eyes shut, they panicked. Sob had thought him dead and nearly burst Ayram’s belly to save his body from being preyed on by they spirits - but Pella saw that he was still breathing. It was only a scratchy wheeze, but it was steady. He was alive.
Once Pella wrapped his head with a scrap of black cloth that she’d torn from her cloak, she ordered him and others to be carried out of the rain. It took four men to shoulder Ayram’s great bulk into the damp, dark of the Underworld, and it took everyone to see him through, all the way back to their pit cave. 
It was the middle of the night the Ayramun returned to their abode. There was no rain, no clouds. Only the moon, stars, and gentle wind. The dead were placed together under a tarred canvas. Needle branches were placed on top to quash the smell. 
Ayram, they lay carefully down on a haybed. He was breathing a little better but he hadn’t yet woken up. Once a fire a was made, and once Pella had seen to him, she ambled over to a dark corner of the pit where the lizard brothers had dumped the mage. 
Pella found the two brothers squatting on top of the naked mage, sniffing scale oil from a wooden bowl. She startled them  from their little reverie with a question.
“Hasn’t woken up, has he?”
The two brothers, Jel and Goreet, looked at eachother with blank stares, and then at Pella. They really did look as much like lizards as humans could possibly look.
“I take it that’s a no?” Pella asked.
Trying to answer a question while high on scale oil was like trying to sprint through a tar field. The jaw just doesn’t work right. All the muscles in the head get gunked up, even the tongue. The brothers could never hold a conversation - they just hissed their way through them. Other than the high, the hissing was part of the reason why they sniffed so much scale oil, they thought it made them act more like lizards. 
So Jel and Goreet just smiled and nodded and hissed through the teeth that they’d filed to points. That was the closest they could come to looking friendly. No one ever smiled back. It wasn’t just the sharp teeth; long ago the brothers had  lopped off the tips of their noses so that they resembled reptilian slits, and a lifetime of sniffing scale oil had turned the whites of their eyes a grimy green-yellow. 
Pella rapped their shoulders with her cane to shoo them off the unconscious mage. She wanted to get a better look.
As Goreet stood up he pointed down at the mage, who was lying face down in the sand. It seemed to Pella that he wanted to show her something, but he could only get out three words: “Mage not man.”
“Mages are strange creatures,” Pella said, “but they’re still men nonetheless. Maybe this one is skinnier than usual, but mages don’t have to be fat. That’s a common misconception. It’s the quality of what’s in the stomach that matters, not how much is there. In fact that gets to a rule of thumb: if a mage is skinny then he’s  probably quite powerful.”
She prodded the unconscious mage in the ribs. He was as skinny as a child, and looked barely older than one.
“Those glyphs tattooed on the skin aren’t normal either,” Pella said. “I’ve never seen anything like them.” 
Pella traced the outline of a large black symbol that was tattooed on the mage’s back. Everything but his neck, face, and forearms were writ with intricate arcane symbols. His skin otherwise was as white and pale as can be, almost transparent. There was no pinkish hue to him, though the stark, orange light of a campfire has a way of warping color, so she couldn’t tell for sure.
“Hand me a knife,” Pella grumbled. 
Goreet pulled a blade from his boot and held it out to Pella.
“Actually, you do it,” Pella said. “Split his wrist.”
Goreet squatted down and picked up the mage’s right arm. With his thumb steadying the flat back of the blade,  Goreet pushed his knife into the mage’s wrist like he was peeling a fat quava root. Dark blood poured out. 
Pella reached down, pulled the bleeding wrist from Goreet’s grasp to inspect. She had to push Goreet out of the way so that the flickering firelight could better catch the color of the blood.
It wasn’t red, or black like someone who’d spent too much time in the Samlan Waste. It was a deep, dark blue.
Pella stood up. The mage’s wrist slipped from her grasp and fell into the sand. She turned and held up her own fingers closer to the fire. A little blood had gotten on them, and it sparkled blue as she rolled her fingers round.
“This can’t be right,” she mumbled.
She looked back at the mage. Goreet and Jel were standing over him. If they were surprised by the blue blood their numbed faces wouldn’t have be able to show it. They didn’t seem to care. They had turned the mage over, put him belly up, and Goreet had kicked his legs apart so that Pella could get a good view at the naked mage’s crotch. 
There wasn’t anything there. 
Goreet was pointing at the absence of flesh, and repeated what he had said earlier.
“Not man.”
The mage’s groin, from the belly all the way down, was completely smooth, just like a statue carved out of the age of Zeladeen when artists were so concerned with decency that they skipped the sex organs altogether.

INSERT bit where someone says they saw him raising his arms, swirling hands/using hands to summon magic. Pella is like OH SHIT.

“What kind of creature are you?” Pella wondered aloud. She stood like that for a moment, as if contemplating the best way to run. Eventually she grunted and told the brothers to tie their captive to a staff. 
Gorett took his own oak spear and planted it in the ground. Pella shook her head.
“No. I mean put it on his shoulders and bar his arms apart. We need to splay them out, keep his hands from doing anything.”
By now a few other Ayramun had wandered over to see what was going on. Seculla seemed the most interested of the lot. She was kneeling next to the mage’s body, trying her best to divine the meaning of the intricate tattoos. Out in the desert, tattoos are ugly things, scratched and scrawled and imprecise. The fractal patterns on the mage’s chest were cleaner, sharper, than a human hand could make, and each pattern was composed of smaller patterns, tiny swirling lines, that seemed thinner than any needle write.
 Pella rapped Seculla’s outstretched arm with her cane.“Careful child,” she said. “You were born in the empire - don’t you recognize what he is?”
“No,” said Seculla.
“What is he?” someone else asked.
A few more Ayramun were crowding around now and their long shadows cut up the light. There were seven of them standing there, including Pella. The rest of the twenty-five Ayramun who had survived were spread about the cave, dealing with the loss of their friends in their own private ways. Some shed tears, some tried to make busy to keep from thinking about it, but most were just too tired to do anything but lay down with a pipe of freeweed and be with themselves in silent grief. 
Pella wondered how many of them were thinking thoughts of giving it all up. She knew she had to do something. The moment seemed ripe for a sermon.
“Just tie him up,” Pella said, “then bring him closer to the fire. And where’s Elrahet?”
“Bitch sulks in Underworld. Where she belong, I think.”
Pella spun round to see little Hill. The man was only four and a half feet tall, but he was Pella’s biggest annoyance. She was about to smack him in the throat with her cane, but Seculla leapt to Elrahet’s defense first. 
“Elrahet didn’t do this.”
“Who else?” Hill asked.
“It was him,” Seculla said, pointing to the mage. Goreet had propped him up and was holding him steady while Jell tied his scrawny arms up to the haft of the spear.  “At least I think it was him,” Seculla said. “I saw him raise his arms to the sky, and that’s when...I saw a flash come from his body.”
“Bullshit,” Hill snorted. “I saw a bolt come down from storm. Elrahet’s storm.”
“Elrahet is what saved us” Pella said. “Believe me when I say this creature would have killed us all.”
“What is he then?” Hill asked, but Pella did not answer. She instead motioned for the Lizard brothers to stop 
“That’s tight enough. Now bring him over to the fire. And someone with a heart go fetch Elrahet out of the dark.”
Pella liked to say that to be an Ayramun was to be tied to a wheel of pain the size of a calendar year. As it revolves it grinds the Ayramun into the frenzy of the fight, it mixes them with all the excitement and passion they can handle - but then it keeps rolling along and suddenly they’re pulled right out of the blood and guts and into interminable boredom of waiting for it all to come back around. Sometimes it’s more than a year until the next bit of action, sometimes it’s much less. The way the Ayramun operated meant there’d never be too much risk and so there’d always be too much waiting. It was only bearable because they never lost. But now, they’d lost half their number, and Ayram was unconscious on the floor of their cave.
To make matters worse, the blast that killed their friends had also destroyed the caravan’s wagons and whatever was in them. The pickings were so poor that they could fit inside a single man-sized sack. Only Mandri and Purloin bothered to sort it all. The two were busy at it by the fire.
“Still not found a scrap of gold,” Purloin complained as she pulled a half-shattered iron cookplate out of the bag.
“Not a fleck of it,” Mandri affirmed. 
Purloin, called Purl, was such a waifish, half-starved looking thing that she made Mandri look well-fed. She was also missing her right arm, a fact which leaned into the running joke that time was turning her into a lockpick, being so thin, knobby, and unbalanced as she was.
Mandri had already given up hope that there was anything valuable tucked inside the few rusted tinboxes he was pulling out of the bag. There was only the affects of men roughing it on long march: melted sticks of lye soap, cheap coins, spoons, and little levers for handmills. Junk. 
Mandri grew more and and more frustrated by the sight of each new trifle.
“I even scoured that crater,” he said. “Not a fleck of gold in it. Gold should have survived that blast. If a tin-box and barrel bands survived, gold should have.”
“No gold,” Purl moaned. “Even if we melt this all down, it comes to what?”
Mandri shook his head in disgust. “It’s not worth thirty Ayramun, that’s for  damned sure. This shit ain’t worth lookin’ at.”
Mandri stuffed the tinboxes back into the loot bag and tightened the drawstring as tight as he could. He then laced the opening so that nothing could fall out - not that it mattered if anything fell out.
“Honestly, we should toss this trash,” he said.
“It’s worth something,” Purl argued.
“Well I’m not hauling it. You gonna do it? You can hardly carry yourself.”
“I’ll get someone to help,” Purl said defensively.
“Get who? There’s like ten of us left.  All the stuff we need to carry, and you want to carry this shit?”
Purl’s sunken eyes glared out at Mandri. “I ain’t leavin’ that ambush with nothin’ to show for it!” she snapped. “You wanna leave thirty dead friends for nothin’, you go ahead. But I’ll make them count for somethin’, and I’ll bet theres at least one other who does too.”
Mandri shrugged off Purl’s indictment with a smile.“But that only makes it worse, doesn’t it,” he said. “Thirty dead for a pocket of silver somehow feels worse than thirty dead for nothin.” 
Purl rose to her feet and pointed her finger at Mandri. Her voice was thick with acrimony as she accused him of having no heart. “I bet you don’t even care and never did. You don’t like anyone. You say it all the time. I bet you don’t even care that Sentee, Cally, and Poor are dead. What are you even here for?”
“Oh, I don’t care?”
Mandrameen’s leather bag of scrolls was nearby, the one’s with the stories of the Ayramun. He reached in and grabbed a handful of them, and right of the top was Sentee’s. Hers was a familiar story - cast out into the Sand because of something she’d done. Then picked up by Ayram.
Mandri pointed out the thick letters he’d printed at the top of the page to Purl.
“You see this?” he asked her.  “This spells ‘Sentee’.”
He tossed the scroll into the fire.
Purl crossed her arms and feigned indifference.
“Ah yes, here’s Cally too. And Poor. And Jor, Iltwin, and For. They’re all dead, too. Won’t need these then. ”
“What are you doing!?” Purl shouted as Mandri made to toss them into the flames. Mandri stood there with a quizzical frown.
“Well, you say I don’t care, then I guess I don’t care. Spent all this time getting to know them, but your right, it doesn’t mean anything.”
“The hell is wrong with you?”
“You almost seem more upset at me for tossing these papers away, than at Ayram for tossing away their actual lives.”
The gall of Mandri’s words echoed around the cave, pricking the ears of any Ayramun who were trying to shut out the bickering. One by one they turned their eyes turned to the fire, squinting in disbelief, wrinkling their noses at the stink of Mandri’s insinuation.
Purl, for her part, was trying piece together what Mandri had just said. She’d heard him alright, but like the others, couldn’t believe he went at Ayram like that. She even tried to repeat the words, to dress them up with derision and trivialize the matter, but found she couldn’t do it. To blame Ayram for anything, when you knew him, was impossible. 
Mandri was starting to get a sense for the attention he was drawing to himself. 
“What? I’m just saying that it’s weak to try to make them that’s dead mean something when they don’t. Accept that they’re dead and they died for nothin.  Accept facts as facts - Ayram screwed up, put us out on bad info, and then people died. We lost. And when you lose you don’t get somethin’ for it so stop tryin’ to get it.”
“We didn’t lose,” Purl said through clenched teeth. 
Mandri laughed. “This sure as hell ain’t winning. What would you call this empty cave? Seems like a whole lot of losing to me.”
“We didn’t lose because this ain’t over.”
“And just what is all twelve pounds of Purloin the bone-bag going to do to the Empire?” Mandri asked.
“I’m going to do what Ayram said we’d do.” 
“Ayram? You still believe in him? In one night we’ve lost half of what we’ve gained in twenty years.”

The weight of the attention thrown at the fire knocked the two out of their little spat. But Mandrameen was a pure-blooded Jandrian, proud and resolute to the last. He would stand by his convictions. His voice rose to challenge the heightened tension.
“I’m not interested in merely surviving out here, if you can call this surviving,” he said. “If we’re going to die by the dozens, we should to be closer to Jeket, closer to the people whose lives we’re trying to change.”
Pella was near to the fire. Close to him. She was looking right through his skull with the eyes of a hungry lion.
“Yesterday, there was what, fourty of us? Today there’s fourteen. There’s over a million people in Jeket! Five hundred thousand spread out on the coast near Shul. We’re not the ones who are going to toss the Empire out of Jandri. If the war is going to be won, its the people who are going to do it.”
Pella spat into the flames.
“It’s Ayram that’s going to win this war,” she said. “I spent twenty years, longer than you’ve been alive, trying to stir Jeket into fury. Jeket… Jeket had a hundred years to do something about the terrors inflicted on them.”
Mandri scoured the blinking darkness for a sympathetic face. He need just one pair of eyes to match his gaze, to share his confidence and give it right back redoubled. But he couldn’t see well enough into the dark. If there was any agreement there, it was hidden in the shadows of their faces. There was only Purl and Pella. They, and the mage, were the only ones near enough to the fire for Mandri to read.
“You know, I used to be you,” Pella said. “Young and ignorant. Using every ‘mistake’ leadership makes as a prop for your own ideas. You just haven’t lived long enough to be disappointed by how the world works. I won’t hold it against you. But you need to shut up now.”
“Where’s the gold, Pella?”, Mandri asked.
“Sit down, boy.”
“I’m only asking a question. Where’s the gold?”
Pella “The gold is right here you idiot!”
“The mage?” Mandri asked.
“The MAZYDEI!” Pella croaked.
All eyes turned to the naked mage. The Mazydei. The Spark of the Schisma Guilds. General of the Empire. The most powerful being on the continent. To a cultish band on the edge of the continent trying to strike a blow to the Empire, he was the most valuable thing in the world.
“Yes. You sad, pitiful creatures.” Pella said. She then mocked their complaints. Not just Mandri either. She paced up and down the fire, scanning the darkness for sad faces as she mocked their wekness. “Boo-hoo, there’s no gold! All these deaths with nothing to show for it. I’m sorry to burst your pity party, but we’ve got a Mazydei in our midst. Does that not liven you up a little bit? Oh, now you’re speechless, Mandri? Does this not meet your criteria for success?”
Mandri’s mind was reeling at the revelation that there was a Mazydei on the floor of their cave. He’d only ever seen a Mazydei once, when he was a little boy. A Mazydei general led an Imperial column through the streets of his city of Belize. But that Mazydei had been a giant - ten feet tall and as stout as an ox. The twiggy creature that lay there helpless in the sand seemed another kind of thing altogether.
“But he’s so small,” Mandri muttered in disbelief.
“Yes, that’s why I missed it at first,” Pella said. “But make no mistake. This is no man or woman. See here -” She pointed the mage’s smooth crotch, at the absence of genitalia. Then she pointed to it’s belly. “And no belly button either. This thing was made, not born. And you all saw what it was doing on the Juneii road. Summoning power with its hands. Not power through the stomach, through words. Not power through blood. Power through its hands. Only one kind of creature can do that. Only one kind of creature does that while marching in a column of Imperial elites. A Mazydei. Why he’s so small, I don’t know.”
“What is he doing out here?” came another.
“I’ve no idea.”
Silence. Pella got annoyed at the silence. A headless chicken. Wished they’d take a little more initiative.

“I haven’t given a sermon in more than thirty years. Not since my time as Nearest to the Emperor. Not since Ayram found me half-dead in a cell in Uttariz. I haven’t preached because Ayram’s always been here to whip your souls into shape. You’ve never needed to hear what I have to say.”
“And I mean what I really have to say. Not the chirps and dangles to cure your spits of laze. I’m talking bout the kinds of things that got me this -” She pointed at the old scar which wrapped around her neck.
“So now Ayram’s hurt, and some of you… not just Mandri… I look around and see the sorriest set of faces I’ve ever seen. It’s sad that an old shit like me, with a foot in the grave, demands less pity. Is that what you want? More pity? Is that what you’ve been fighting for this whole time, to get a bit of pity for your troubles?”
“Sure, sure, you can grieve. Or, you could steel yourselves and be Ayramun.”


“One of the eight. Maybe this one is the ninth. And here he is, kneeling before us. My younger self would quivered at the thought. A impossible dream, but here he is.” 
All eyes turned to the Mazyd. Dawning apprehension. Of course he was no mage, no mage looked like him.
“Maybe you understand, now, why there’s no time for grief, much less pity. It’s a time for action. It’s always a time for action, but maybe now you fools can see it.”
They all just stare at the Mazyd for a moment. There was hushed silence as all eyes turned towards the mage. He was hunched over his knees, arms splayed out behind him, tied to the staff. The side of his face was flat against the dirt. The black patterns on his back seemed to shift as the firelight shifted. This had not been a defeat. They’d capture the most valuable thing in existence.
“What do we do with him?”
“He stirs!”
Pella looked over, and indeed the Mazyd was moving. Before, his breathing had been almost imperceptible, but now his whole back and ribs were heaving, filling his lungs with air. Pella hobbled around him to get a look at his face. His eyes were blinking wearily, as if the even weak light of the campfire was too much for them to take. 
“He’s waking up!” Pella exclaimed. “Good! Good. 


“Yes. A Mazydei. You all know what they are - weapons of war. But for me they are something simpler, yet more powerful. They’re proof of a simple and incontrovertible truth - that the rich and powerful are not so powerful as we. Think of it: kings, queens, and little princes are so scared of us, so scared of losing control that they resort to pulling abominations like this one the void to serve them. But shadows of power can only birth shadows of power.”
Pella was reaching into her memory now. Her final sermons.
“Kings. Queens. Princes. They strut around in parades and give gifts to eachother and genuflect in scripted rituals designed to reinforce the pyramid of power, but it's all a sham, because underneath their blue satin sashes are squishy necks that are slit just as easily as any other.”
Pella stabbed the Mazydei’s torso with her cane for effect.
“They try to pretend that they are special. Kings. Queens. Princes. They pretend that they’re not born swimming in afterbirth like the rest of the human race. They imagine that they’re born clean and powdered, that their skin is softer and better suited for the deep blue velvet. That their pudgy little hands know just what to do with a diamond encrusted rattle. The narrative of their lives is crafted even as they sleep; I’ve seen it myself: slim little courtesans leaning over royal cribs, whispering, ‘Doesn’t she look exactly like a little queen?’. The rest of the howling babes grow up into common folk. Into You. Into me. And what is our lot, according to them? According to him.”
Pella prodded the Mazyd again as she said it. No one answered her.
“Well go on. What is our lot?” Pella asked again.
It was Hill who ansered. “To endure them!” he shouted.
“Endure and obey,” Pella corrected. “They claim that it if it wasn’t the will of Sol for us to be poor, for us to suffer, then it would not be so. They claim that they have all the money, land, and pleasure because it is Sol’s will. After all, if that wasn’t true, then it would not be so!”
Boos.
“But it’s not Sol’s will that takes grain out of the mouths of the poor. It’s not even the paid thugs and traitors who do it. It’s not Sol who pulls the Mazydei out from the pit of Hell. It’s Kings, Queens, and Princes.”
By now the Mazyd was coming to. His head was off the ground. His back was arched. His eyes were open. Pella was too rapt up in her sermon to notice it.  
“It doesn’t take a brilliant mind to see through it. It takes a hungry one.  Every time a fat king refuses to buy grain at the ancient price, or debases the currency to pay for his wars of vanity, or kicks out a Jandrian tribe from sacred land -“
More boos. A few disorderly shouts and curses.
“You know what happens. Yes! You are what happens ! Hold on, Tenny, put your knife away. Someone take Tenny’s knife from him.”
“I don’t like the way he looks!” Tenny shouted.
Once order was restored, Pella continued on with her sermon.

“This pitiful dried cunt is a Mazydei. Light of the Empire. Wise and powerful. The culmination of centuries of art, alchemy, and fleshcraft, stretching all the way back to the great Saulistides. Leaders of men. Immortal. But the thing you really need to know is this: do not trust them. You think you’ve neutered the beast because you’ve cut off his hands, but his most potent weapon is his tongue. ”
“Mazydei never lie.”
“Yes. Sure. You can trust their naked words. Trust their statements of fact, sure. But you can’t trust them. Trust me when I say that there is deceit behind every truth they tell.”
At that the Mazydei spit a wad of blue blood at Pella’s feet.
“Oh? Something to say, demon?”
“That’s not true.”
“Coming to your defense?”
“We do not lie. We are not deceitful.”
Pella let out one of her usual apathetic grunts. “Hah!”
“
“Tell me, child, what is your name?”
“Mazyd Oro.”
“Mazyd Oro…”  Pella repeated. The name fell out of her mouth like she was already bored of hearing it. She looked over to the rest of the Ayramun and brought them into the conversation with familiar shitbagsihds. “It means Eighth Light. That’s what it means. Mazyd Oro. Eighth Light. They number themselves like that. There used to be only seven Mazydei. I’ve met all of them. But here they’ve gone and made another.” She turned back to Oro. “So, Oro - and you’ll forgive me if I dispense with formality here…Mazyd Oro is too much for me. So, Oro, do you know who I am?”
This time Oro spoke up. There was a tinge of disgust in his voice.“You were once Nearest to the Emperor.”
“And my name?”
“I will not say it.”
A stifled laughter rumbled throughout the cave. The Ayramun took pride in their surrogate mother. Here she was, a woman who demanded respect from even the Empire’s greatest. 
But Pella didn’t laugh. She didn’t even smile. Pyetle wondered if she even could.
“You know,” Pella said, “I’ve always wondered about your numbering. First Light, Eighth Light… If the Mazydei’s names are ordered like that then there has got to be some purpose to it. Maybe there’s a hierarchy - but that never made sense because you all seem to be interchangeable. One day I would be dealing with Mazyd Elay, and the next day it was Mazyd Por, with no variance in their abilities, knowledge, or affect. It was as if they were the same entity, occupying different bodies. So, and you’ll have to tell me if this is true, do you number yourselves just to cater to our silly human sensibilities?”
“I wouldn’t call it silly,” Mazyd said.
“You don’t think an ineffiecent cultural artifact like naming is beneath you?”
 “Names are practical things.  How else would you distinguish one person from another?”
“But is there any point in distinguishing one Mazydei from another?”
“Would we do it if there was no point?”
“That’s what I want to know. Ever since I was a little girl I’ve suspected that the Mazydei are one being. One being, but putting on a front for us humans. You know, ‘This is Mazyd Oro and this is Mazyd Pel’, but really, you’re all the same mind. Is that how it is?”
“Not exactly, no.”
“Then how is it, exactly?”
“I can not say.”
“Oh?”
“It is impossible to condense our nature into something you could grasp. Any attempt would only create more misapprehension than is already there.”
“Same, same, Mazydei. Never change Mazydei.  You think you’re better than us. No. You know  you’re better than us. But just look at you. And you’re supposed to be an improvement, no? You’re the newest version. The Eighth. The best the Empire has to offer, yet here you are, reduced to a dry, quivering cunt. But you’ve got this… this blindness to your own faults. Just look at you. You’ve lost. You’ve lost everything that matters but .No one likes the smell of their own shit more than a Mazydei.”
“We do not shit.”
“Oh?”
“We literally do not shit.” 
“Oh, it’s not coming out of your asshole, idiot.”
Theres a kind of stillness when Pella didn’t get the laugh she was expecting.
“She means that the shit is coming out of his mouth. See its a play on words because she’s saying it’s coming out of his mouth. His words are shit.”

“I don’t mean to cause offense.”
Whatever profane concoction the guild uses to brew your minds, it goes a little heavy on the arrogance. You would be formidable if you were more modest. Folks would like you more.



Getting your skull caved in is the worst way to lose track of time. Next worst is a night of fitful sleep, but of course that doesn’t compare. Sleep can be said to be a lived experience inasmuch as one’s dreams are remembered.  Even without them, the passage of time is always somehow estimated so that as soon as you step out of bed there is that sublime sensation of being reinserted into the natural flow of things - not so with a knockout blow.
More to the point, there’s the pain.
When Ayram came to, there was a dull, throbbing ache that radiated out from the top of his head where the rock had cracked open his skull. He brought his hand up to the wound and dabbed it gingerly with his fingers. They trembled upon a smattering of dried blood which had matted his hair. He then continued to follow the pain to its source, near the crown of his skull. There he found that he could push down on a flap of skin and a cracked bit of bone. As he traced the outline of the cavity, a sharp pain shot out and ran around to the back of his head, constricting his skull like a python. 
        He must have been out for hours. Maybe days. He had no way of knowing 
Oddly, it was still raining.
        “You’re awake!”
        It was old Pella. She rushed to his side.
        “We were set up!” she said.
        “What?” Ayram asked, confused even as to how he was alive.
“It was a setup! There was no gold!” Her raspy voice was quivering with excitement and rage.
Ayram tried to blink the blur out of his vision. He was in a cave somewhere high in the mountains.
“How long was I out?”, he asked.
“For the better part of a day… There was no gold, Ayram.” 
Ayram winced, half in pain, half in exasperation.
“What happened?” he asked.
“That storm that Elrahet magic’d up conjured a bolt… bigger than any I’ve ever seen... it took out the entire caravan. It took out Papillian and Colm, too, and nearly you. But that magus survived!” Pella pointed to the naked figure who lay crumpled and unconscious near the cave’s mouth. His pale body was covered in black glyphs and arcane symbols. Blood pooled around him.
“He has not yet awoken. I haven’t told the boys yet, but he’s no mere magus. We cut
off his hands… I think he’s one of the Emperor’s Salisians,” Pella said. “Only four Salisians in the world, and one of them is here... He was here to kill us! Ayram, we were set up!”
Ayram struggled to take it all in.
“Who was your man in Jeket?!” Pella asked, stressing the urgency of the moment. 
“Who baited us into this?”
Ayram closed his eyes and gritted his teeth.
“A man named Salavan Saran.”</Text>

It helped that his head, too, was exposed to the chill. His stream of consciousness began to freeze over, and so time itself seemed to congeal. Through his eyelids, every strobing green flash imprinted itself onto his retina, but his viscous state of mind had difficulty separating them, and so his narrative self started to weave intermittent points in time together as if they were actually sequential events. As more and more sensory stimulation slipped past unrecorded, these glimpses of light grew further and further apart. His unconscious mind began to struggle to manufacture coherence, and it started to invent sensations where there were none: a tickling of his fingers and feet, a deep and droning incorporeal hum that grew louder as the green flashed. The effect moved Moto into a trancelike state, though through it all, his existential self, his I-me-mine, did not completely disappear. In fact, there was enough of him left to sense his own impending doom, the stretching of time, the thinness of his life. Starting with the ever-slowing cosmic tick of the universe, he could extrapolate out, and understood that it would eventually stop ticking completely. At that point, time would freeze completely into a kind of reflective prism, crystallizing around whatever his last twinkling thought might be, and that would be death. 
As his mind crept towards this jeweled stasis, its even keel was disturbed by a brief, yearning protestation to stay alert, so that he might revel in the experience of dying for as long as possible, so that his last transcendent moment might be one worthy of eternity - if indeed that was how it worked. 
But he did not die. He just sat there in the blinking darkness for another hour more - an empty husk, not aware enough to understand that he was still alive
Then there was  a rumbling, a fumbling. Then a sudden, disruptive shift in his equilibrium. Moto’s eyelids slid open quickly enough to catch a glimpse of a bright beam of white light as it raked across the interior of the pod, looking just like an errant ray of god’s divine light .


Guy on roganesque talk show
See, the problem with your show, is that it feasts on a quirk of human biology. We’re social creatures. If there’s twenty of us roughing it out on the praire, damn it we better know what our neighbor’s opinions on things are, we better abosrb and talk about them. They effect us! And the thing is, we can sit there, and ‘talk to eachtoher’ about them, and come to a resolution, and press forward! Now you’ve got this mass media, and our monkey brains can’t separate the opinion from practical reality. We can’t talk to eachtoher, the scale of it, so we can’t come to a resolution. It’s perverse!

in war, unreasonable men are superior- but reasonable men won - just shows that historical circumstance and chaos is even greater than any kind of man.

This doesnt make sense
I think it pools

“Let me put in terms you can understand. All matter is made up of what?”
“Atoms.”
“No but… yes. What are Atoms made up of.”
“Particles?”
“And what are particles?”
“I do not know.”
	“They’re excitations of fields. Think of it like this,” she pulls out paper, and holds it up flat to deborah’s eye.
“This is a field”, she said, referring to the paper.
“And this is what it looks like with particles.” then she pushed the two ends of the paper closer together, so that the interior of the paper bent like an accordion into an s-shape.
“The peak is a particle, and the trough is an antiparticle. So, if I flatten it out”, she said as she pulled out the curves so that the paper appeared straight to Deborah,“we have no particles.”
Tea again pushed the paper into an s-shape, and said, “Particles”.
“No particles.” She pulled it flat.
“Something.” The wave shape.
“Nothing.” Flat.
“So,” Deborah began, a little confused but following, “when you ask about ‘nothing’, you’re asking me a physics question?”
“Yes and no. I’m just trying to point out a design principle. Notice how, when I squeeze the paper together, there is both a hump and a valley. A positive and a negative. The very structure of nothingness produces somethingness in pairs.” Again, she squeezed the paper together to demonstrate. “In physics, this hump is a particle and and the valley is an antiparticle. They are created together, and they disappear together.” Again she pulled the paper flat. “So, in a manner of speaking, you can think of nothing as the sum of something.” she said as she slowly pulled the paper flat, the two humps slowly canceling each other out into flatness.
“It seems like it’s only clever wordplay,” Tea continued, “but it isn’t. Everything that exists has a kind of mirror image - an opposite - and when taken together, they equal zero. Take this helicopter for example. The amount of downward force the rotors are generating is exactly equal to the amount of upward momentum. The net energy being added or subtracted from the entire system is zero.”
“That’s easy enough to understand.”
“Yes, but things get much stranger. Though, you aren’t going to understand what any of it has to do with you. For example, if matter and antimatter are supposed to cancel eachother out, and they are both created in equal pairs when we add energy to nothingness, then we should be left with no matter at all when we take the total sum of everything in the universe. But this isn’t what we see. After all, you and I exist.”
“And why won’t I understand what any of this has to do with me?”
“Because from here it gets more… philosophical.”
“Philosophical?”

The events that gave rise to the universe is described by what is known as the standard model. The universe began hot. After about 1/billionth of a second, it cooled down enough for fundamental particles to appear in pairs, of opposite charge. Known as quarks and anti-quarks. After that came leptons and anti-leptons. Like electrons and positrons. These pairs began annihilating eachother. Most quark pairs had annihilated by the time the universe was a few seconds old, with most leptons gone a few seconds later. When the dust settled, a tiny amount of matter, about on particle in a billion, amanaged to survive the annihilation. That tiny amount went on to form the universe we know.

Maybe large stores of anitmatter survived too. Its opposite charge might counter gravity.

How would you describe my culture then? 
Inevitibility
To a true American, the word signifies that the someone hasn’t fully considered all the options, or is instead rooted in ideology instead of practicality. We have been trained since birth to think about possibilities instead of inevitabilities, and about creative destruction instead of stagnation. We idolize success.
In all this, nothing is taught about the law of contrast, that a speck of white is only important because it is surrounded by black, that one person winning means a whole lot of people losing, and that success is only sweet because most people fail.
	This uncomfortable truth has always been easily pushed aside.  We are so ready to believe it, because it means if I ever succeed, it means that I am better than other people, on a fundamental level. This is so fundamental to our psyche, that many have come to an understanding, that they aren’t good.

“Speak American”
Security relies on certain assumptions.
If I have a military base, I assume that whomever comes to attack my base has fewer guys with guns than I do... and I generally it will be a cold day in hell before they'll get very far into the base.
And you assume other things... you assume that your security people can tell the difference between someone with security clearance and a birthday clown.
We assume that the people with clearance obtained it legitimately.
We assume that the people that were given security didn't subsequently decide to sell us out for hookers and blow.
Assumptions.
And there are good assumptions... assumptions that really will hold under most circumstances and bad assumptions.
And good security is basically a process of separating out good assumptions from dumb ones. Then recognizing that your dumb assumptions were a convenient fig leaf you put over serious vulnerabilities that you actually don't have a good solution for...
And then you need to actually come up with a GOOD assumption that covers for what were previously laughable assumptions.
If your security is based on interlocking layers of good assumptions... are you unhackable? I don't know... its a question of perfection and perfection is hard in this universe. BUT... really fucking good security? Near perfect? Sure. I mean... you can do &quot;excellent&quot;... excellent is possible.
But that's not to say that even good security should be discounted as crap. Good is often the best security possible because excellent requires time and money and competent management and users that don't have their heads wedged up their asses.


Now will good security keep ze germans out or whatever? Typically yeah. Even good security is a bitch to get through even for a state sponsored hacking team.
What keeps embarrassing people is SHIT security or NO security.
That is what keeps failing. Not &quot;good security&quot;... not &quot;excellent security&quot;... not &quot;perfect security&quot;...
F'ing none at all keeps failing.
So... lets not geek out on the &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;unhackable&quot; claim. And instead lets focus on whether or not the change to the OS makes Windows have &quot;good security&quot;. If it accomplishes so much as that then we're doing well. If they pushed it up a notch and it's EXCELLENT... Then we're doing very very well indeed.

https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-electricity	
Scientists and engineers have learned many ways to move electrons off of atoms. That means that when you add up the electrons and protons, you would wind up with one more proton instead of being balanced.
Since all atoms want to be balanced, the atom that has been &quot;unbalanced&quot; will look for a free electron to fill the place of the missing one. We say that this unbalanced atom has a &quot;positive charge&quot; (+) because it has too many protons.
Since it got kicked off, the free electron moves around waiting for an unbalanced atom to give it a home. The free electron charge is negative, and has no proton to balance it out, so we say that it has a &quot;negative charge&quot; (-).
So what do positive and negative charges have to do with electricity?
Scientists and engineers have found several ways to create large numbers of positive atoms and free negative electrons. Since positive atoms want negative electrons so they can be balanced, they have a strong attraction for the electrons. The electrons also want to be part of a balanced atom, so they have a strong attraction to the positive atoms. So, the positive attracts the negative to balance out.
The more positive atoms or negative electrons you have, the stronger the attraction for the other. Since we have both positive and negative charged groups attracted to each other, we call the total attraction &quot;charge.&quot;
Energy also can be measured in joules. Joules sounds exactly like the word jewels, as in diamonds and emeralds. A thousand joules is equal to a British thermal unit.
	
When electrons move among the atoms of matter, a current of electricity is created. This is what happens in a piece of wire. The electrons are passed from atom to atom, creating an electrical current from one end to other, just like in the picture.
	
Electricity is conducted through some things better than others do. Its resistance measures how well something conducts electricity. Some things hold their electrons very tightly. Electrons do not move through them very well. These things are called insulators. Rubber, plastic, cloth, glass and dry air are good insulators and have very high resistance.
Other materials have some loosely held electrons, which move through them very easily. These are called conductors. Most metals – like copper, aluminum or steel – are good conductors.

THe only difference between men and women and is that women are much more willing to engage in social gamesmanship. They are a purer breed of political animal. Men don’t like conflict, because for men, it leads to physical fighitng. Thats why women have been kept out of the process for so long.The lines of partisanship is directly correlated to the rise of women in politics.

two guys, one says, “I wan t to ask you a question - sure - Is it ever ok to kill someone - well that is an interesting question - ill give you some time to think about it - no its ok, its something ive thought about a lot acutaully ,i could tell you right now - ok - So, people always start with moral arguments, but you are wasting your time there. What only matters is what the live creature thinks and does and the consequences he has to live with. Guilt, etc. God, what was in this medicene, I feel like ive taken 5 zanax. - there were like 3 or 4 you took there. *his head is rolling back, clearly struggling to maintain consciousness - Anyways, what youve got to ask yourself is, well, once you’ve started asking yourself it becomes difficult to act, because if you are honest with yourself, it becomes difficult to say that you know what the consequences will be. Like I could certainly make a good argument why killing me would be a bad idea. I could grow up to change the entire world for the better. You could be robbing everyone of that. But then again, that is just the creature aspect of myself reacting to the idea of being killed. It doesn’t want to die, so it will argue for, and try to justify my own existence. So basically, you have to satisfy your creature self, thats all that really matters. *then the dude dies from teh poison that the questioner gave hime.

The law is an enclosed world. The idea that law is supremely important, more important than any other subject, that it is absolutely vital to an understanding of the world, all of these sentiments that you often hear uttered, but only by lawyers. It is unique in that respect. There are people who have never studied philosophy, who admire philosophers. There are people who have never studied history that admire historians. Lawyers are a unique breed in that they have a propensity for acting as their own cheerleaders.

natural vs. revealed theology
the two books - nature - the book of god’s works
		   scripture - the book of god’s revealed theology



S_BEKSINSKI

	Gilgamesh, what you seek you will never find. For when the gods created man, they let death be his lot, eternal life they withheld. Let your every day be full of joy. Love the child that holds your hand. Delight in your wife’s embrace, for these alone, are the concerns of humanity.

“To start, we must first ask, “What is natural about humans?” Unlike the bull or tiger, we are weak, however, we are creatures of reason. “What is natural for creatures that are weak, but reasonable?” It is to join together against stronger creatures. This is the natural law of interests. As rational egoists we need to join together, and because of this we are compelled to create - artificially - a functioning social life; an abstraction of natural love and natural hatred. This accord between humans manifests itself grandly in the form of nation states. Established in the twentieth century, these institutions still exist today, because, of course, there is no need for them to consolidate even further.. Outside of the atom bomb, there has been no ‘stronger creature’ to overcome. The nation state is the apex predator. A global institution with teeth is not only undesirable, it is completely unnecessary. Only the discovery of a more superior creature could disturb this equilibrium.”

-Jakub Beksinski, Jurisprudence and International Law (2135)

“The fundamental mechanism of adaptation in any system is the revision and recombination of its building blocks. The cell will reorganize its proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids to perform different functions. On a larger scale the corporation will reorganize its divisions, the divisions will reorganize their departments, and the departments will reorganize their employees. In order for an adaptation of this kind to be beneficial, it is absolutely crucial for the complex adaptive system to have some method of acquiring accurate information about its environment. Otherwise the system essentially reverts to natural selection to prune inefficiencies, and this is a terribly inefficient process.
For the individual, narrative is the enemy of accurate perception of one’s environment. Narrative precludes the complete understanding of a problem by idealizing those features of a system which it deems ‘non-essential’. In simpler terms the storyteller says,“Look at this and ignore that.” Storytelling is seduction; its purpose is to divert attention away from what is really there to what the storyteller wants you to see. The active consciousness is a kind of storyteller. It can cause one to ignore large amounts of data in favor of creating a quick and neat model of understanding. Human evolution has proven this behavior to be a useful heuristic when one is confronted with certain mammalian problems. However, when confronted with a complex threat this process can be fatal. To avoid this trap, one must approach a problem first through the nervous system, taking in as much uninterpreted data as possible. Only after this is done is it suitable to apply conscious effort. To always be arriving at a more accurate understanding, this process should be repeated until one is forced to act.”

Jakub Beksinski, Data Driven Structures (2134)

Those who have handled sciences have been either men of experiment or men of dogmas. The men of experiment are like the ant, they only collect and use; the reasoners resemble spiders, who make cobwebs out of their own substance. But the bee takes a middle course: it gathers its material from the flowers of the garden and of the field, but transforms and digests it by a power of its own. Not unlike this is the true business of philosophy; for it neither relies solely or chiefly on the powers of the mind, nor does it take the matter which it gathers from natural history and mechanical experiments and lay it up in the memory whole, as it finds it, but lays it up in the understanding altered and digested. Therefore from a closer and purer league between these two faculties, the experimental and the rational (such as has never yet been made), much may be hoped.

Bacon's The New Organon and his contribution to empiricism and the scientific revolution.

When it comes to tackling difficult problems, there are - as Francis Bacon put it - three different types of problem solvers. There are spiders, there are ants, and there are bees.
Spiders are those who try to solve complex problems by constructing abstract webs of well-reasoned thought. The problem solving process for them is a principally deductive exercise, in which causes can be deduced from symptoms. Imagine Sherlock Holmes turning his lens onto the human condition, attempting to unravel its mysteries.  An extremely complex problem, the spider correctly assumes, calls for an elegant solution. 
Ants are people who experiment. Unlike the spider, they do not create using substances pulled from themselves, they record what simply and undeniably, is. This is the inductive method, empirical, scientific, only resting on what the evidence can bear. No quarter is given to speculation, idle reasoning, and bullshit. An extremely complex problem, the ant correctly assumes, cannot be reasoned about except through experimentation. 
Bees are the consummate middle. Like ants, they journey out into the real world, experimenting with its matter, mapping its contours, learning its history. They use this practical experience as a foundation to organize, like spiders, elegant structures that help to achieve a desired end. An extremely complex problem, the bee correctly assumes, requires an elegant solution derived through experimentation. 
It takes effort, even training, to be a bee. It is easy to slip into spider-like habits, because every problem, from human suffering to tying your shoes, can be modeled, simplified, abstracted into discrete and configurable components. But there is always the question of implementation. It is easy for the spider to say, “Humans are endowed with certain inalienable rights”, but to actually protect them is another matter. Similarly, it is easy to be an ant, refusing to deal with anything that isn’t tangible in the pursuit of accuracy. It is impossible to be wrong if one deals only with what the facts say, and nothing more. The unfortunate result of this necessarily narrow field of view is that things like human rights simply do not exist. There is only what is real, and this is the law, as crafted by those who power, this is the natural law, any other considerations are dreams. Realpolitik. Being a bee requires the discipline to stick to the facts when they are there, and the courage to explore when they aren’t. 

“speculatists,” with their grandiose plans for the wholesale replacement of a corrupt present with a rational future.1 Burke had nothing but scorn for “those extravagant and presumptuous speculations” that lead revolutionary leaders “to despise all their predecessors, and all their contemporaries.”2 The proper course of action, in his opinion, is to build on the solid basis of the past, and always with due regard to the concrete realities of human experience. 


If humans have the same hardware, but different software, then the act of problem solving reveals the common underlying threads. 

Bacon spider/bee/ant analogy - America, and the international community in general, suffers from an infestation of spiders, who have weaved their webs so intricately so as to accept only other spiders into their affairs. 


Get rid of the fluffy speculation, that common law ‘emanates’ from natural law. From arbitrary guidelines that the practical legislator is somehow supposed to divine the meaning of. 


It is not unreasonable  for one to see the injustices of the law and suppose law is the problem. In the fire of the moment, it can be difficult to abstract the practice and necessity of law from its fallen implementation. The rule of law, from the individual’s perspective, the only palatable way of being. Of course, this conception of natural law’s emanation is just as idealistic as that of the alternative ‘benevolent ruler, in that it requires just, honest, and righteous men and women to write. The great strength of reliance upon natural law its advances, are more permanent and difficult to change. Of course the great weakness is that if it is ever written by the unrighteous, these changes too are difficult to change. The benevolent ruler model is the opposite, in which unrighteous rules can be easily removed, whereas if the ruler is not benevolent, then righteous rules may be cast by the wayside in an instant. Of course, the Realpolitik suggests that this is also true in nations governed by the rule of law, and this may seem so in the short run, but time bears witness to its efficacy. 
	Take for example, the conquer of the New World. A wholly unjust doctrine to be sure, and even so during the time in which it took place. During the 14th century the doctrine of natural was firmly fixed as the north star in the constellation of laws guiding the western medieval world. It was, rightly, even veiwed by Aquinas as that The Christian world in that time, for all the flak it receives for injustice, was the only soverign that recognized the right of pagan countries to exist. The reason for this, is the development of the concept of natural law - first begun by the greeks and romans, and expounded upon by thinkers like the dominican Aquinas, Suarez, and Voltine. These men recognized that the only way to govern justly, in this sinful world, was to separate out the laws of man from the laws of truth, emanating from the naturalness of nature. Even God did not exist, it was argued, these laws still would. And so, there came a general understanding that all men, pagan or not, had certain basic rights that could not be trampled on by any other human, christian or not. This is the lasting contribution, built up over time, of the western world to the community of nations. 
	But there are strategies to help write easily readable, understandable, just, and efficacious law. It is helpful to think of the development of law to the practice of computer science. Legacy code. Ecapsulation. Elegance. Context dependent = bad. examples. Great utility for one bit of code.
 propoganda
by Edward Bernays
Ig publishing, 2005, paper
(originally published in 1928)

p37
The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.
We are governed, our minds molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society.
Our invisible governors are, in many cases, unaware of the identity of their fellow members in the inner cabinet.
They govern us by their qualities of natural leadership, their ability to supply needed ideas and by their key position in the social structure. Whatever attitude one chooses toward this condition, it remains a fact that in almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons-a trifling fraction of our hundred and twenty million-who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world.
It is not usually realized how necessary these invisible governors are to the orderly functioning of our group life. In theory, every citizen may vote for whom he pleases. Our Constitution does not envisage political parties as part of the mechanism of government, and its framers seem not to have pictured to themselves the existence in our national politics of anything like the modern political machine. But the American voters soon found that without organization and direction their individual votes, cast, perhaps, for dozens of hundreds of candidates, would produce nothing but confusion. Invisible government, in the shape of rudimentary political parties, arose almost overnight. Ever since then we have agreed, for the sake of simplicity and practicality, that party machines should narrow down the field of choice to two candidates, or at most three or four.
In theory, every citizen makes up his mind on public questions and matters of private conduct. In practice, if all men had to study for themselves the abstruse economic, political, and ethical data involved in every question, they would find it impossible to come to a conclusion without anything. We have voluntarily agreed to let an invisible government sift the data and high-spot the outstanding issue so that our field of choice shall be narrowed to practical proportions. From our leaders and the media they use to reach the public, we accept the evidence and the demarcation of issues bearing upon public question; from some ethical teacher, be it a minister, a favorite essayist, or merely prevailing opinion, we accept a standardized code of social conduct to which we conform most of the time.
In theory, everybody buys the best and cheapest commodities offered him on the market. In practice, if every one went around pricing, and chemically tasting before purchasing, the dozens of soaps or fabrics or brands of bread which are for sale, economic life would be hopelessly jammed. To avoid such confusion, society consents to have its choice narrowed to ideas and objects brought to it attention through propaganda of all kinds. There is consequently a vast and continuous effort going on to capture our minds in the interest of some policy or commodity or idea.
It might be better to have, instead of propaganda and special pleading, committees of wise men who would choose our rulers, dictate our conduct, private and public, and decide upon the best types of clothes for us to wear and the best kinds of food for us to eat. But we have chosen the opposite method, that of open competition. We must find a way to make free competition function with reasonable smoothness. To achieve this society has consented to permit free competition to be organized by leadership and propaganda.


S_ART

The brain is actively hiding the real world from us. - Cognitive theory
The more formally constructed your game is, the more limited it will be.

It is also anti-idealist. It refuses the idea that in aesthetic experience we perceive “a pure integration of meaning”. His aesthetics is consequently anti-representationalist. There is in the artwork something which Gadamer describes as its resistance to integration, to being reduced to a concept (Palmer 2001 25). He contends that Hegel's definition of the beautiful as the “sensuous appearing of the Idea” presumes that aesthetic experience is able to reach beyond the specific type of appearance to its underlying idea. In this model, aesthetic experience becomes the expectation of a semantic fulfillment. Once the idea behind the appearance is grasped, “the whole of its meaning would have been understood once and for all and thus brought in to our possession so to speak”. The work of art becomes a carrier of meaning, to be abandoned once the lead story has been grasped. But, Gadamer argues, “our understanding of art works is manifestly not of this type. Everyone knows this from his or her own encounters with art, from concerts, visits to museums, and from his or her reading”(Palmer 2001 66). This denial of idealist aesthetics is at the basis of his claim that an artwork is essentially enigmatic.
Gadamer's opposition to aesthetic idealism is supported by the claim that art “cannot be satisfactorily translated in terms of conceptual knowledge” (RB 69). A work does not simply refer to a meaning which is independent of itself. Its meaning is not to be grasped in such a way that that it can be simply transferred to another idiom.

Rudolph Arnheim: The Split and the Structure
From Chaos to Wholeness
In a gestalt, each unit is affected and modified by its relations to other units of the system. Each relation, in turn, is affected by the agent generating it. It is an interaction that operates within every level of the structure, from the whole to its subordinates and between the various levels as well. Given the three- dimensional complexity of such a structure, it can be conceptualized only in approximation, which is what scientists are equipped to do when they describe the functioning of organisms or the nature of sensory perception. The same is true for aestheticians analyzing works of art.

The Sokal affair, also called the Sokal hoax,[1] was a publishing hoax perpetrated by Alan Sokal, a physics professor at New York University and University College London. In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to Social Text, an academic journal of postmodern cultural studies. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's intellectual rigor and, specifically, to investigate whether &quot;a leading North American journal of cultural studies – whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as Fredric Jameson and Andrew Ross – [would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions&quot;.[2]
The article, &quot;Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity&quot;, was published in the Social Text spring/summer 1996 &quot;Science Wars&quot; issue. It proposed that quantum gravity is a social and linguistic construct. At that time, the journal did not practice academic peer review and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.[3][4] On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in Lingua Franca that the article was a hoax, identifying it as &quot;a pastiche of left-wing cant, fawning references, grandiose quotations, and outright nonsense ... structured around the silliest quotations [by postmodernist academics] he could find about mathematics and physics.&quot;[2]
The hoax sparked a debate about the scholarly merit of humanistic commentary about the physical sciences; the influence of postmodern philosophy on social disciplines in general; academic ethics, including whether Sokal was wrong to deceive the editors and readers of Social Text; and whether Social Text had exercised appropriate intellectual rigor.



S_LAWS

“Call me Elle.”
Frank was reminded of a friend’s warning about women in Shreveport. Don’t get involved. They’re venus man-traps. Sirens on the rocks of Shreveport. 

I went to a lower tiered school. Think 3rd-4th tier.
 I grinded for five years, billing insane hours for a insurance defense litigation sweat shop. After five years of litigation, I lateraled to a Vault firm, where I've been for the last five years. It's the kind of firm that would not accept the likes me, because of my inferior pedigree. Truth be told, I used my less than stellar credentials as motivation, and managed to lateral into my current firm by impressing one of the partner who was a co-defendant.
Five years later, I love the firm, love the work, fantastic institutional clients, but am spent. I can separate how grateful to the partner who hired me, from the toll it's taking on my personal life and desire to do the things I want to do. So, I'm done and my managing partner understands. The money isn't going to buy back the time I'm spending in the office.
So that's it. I'm selling most of my possessions, picking up a backpack, and headed to South America for a while. Where I'll end up, only time will tell. I'll be back in the States eventually.
Just wanted to bid adieu to my hard working colleagues. Be kind.
Edit. I came back this morning and spent half an hour responding to some of the comments here. And thanks for all of them.
When I was 14, I didn't have money for Sadie Hawkins. (Do kids still have that?) I went on the Pennysaver (another relic), saw an ad to sell flowers on the side of the road, so I signed up. Made $32 that day. That bought our tickets, matching t-shirts and bus passes. While I didn't think of it then, I think about that day often, and how it defines who I am and that no work is beneath me. I share that because things always have a way of working themselves out for me.
With respects the to figurative turning in of the bar card, I know my career as an attorney is over. I trust my instincts and know what makes me happy. I understand the need to have safety outlets, but I know that I'm done insofar as my employment as an attorney.
Thank you for the comments and insights.

One of the happiest J.D.s I have known is a woman who runs a little Monewbakery in Juneau, AK. She used to litigate for a V100 firm, got burned out, moved to a charming coastal town, bakes cupcakes, is happy and content. There is life after law,

As I've stated to some of the others, I think the experience as an attorney varies. I know some lawyers who don't really care about their jobs or work, and they're happy as clams. I, on the other hand, internalize everything, and it makes me miserable.

I wish I could join you. After 6 years in a federal agency, 5 years before law school on Capitol Hill, an LLM in a niche field...I can't find a position outside my miserable government office. I've received no real legal training here. No firm would hire me and I'm from a top 50 school with good grades and a top 20 international LLM university. But $100,000+ of student loans and a family has made a modern day slave out of me. No hope of ever owning a home...no real opportunities for advancement or lateraling. The law is a joke as a profession.




You will be told you have to leave, want to leave, or both within five years. Don't sweat the small stuff and during this brief period when you have biglaw income, work on those loans…

fundamentally can’t deal with the existence of whistleblowers. A bug which has been reluctantly accepted as feature. When both parties make comparable just arguments in the law, the law is said to be bad.

Short little questions - Where did you come from? How did you leave? How did you get here?

Only natural law: never own up. Right to silence. Right to self-incrimination

&quot;The maxim is sometimes said to be a fundamental principle of the whole criminal law, but I think that, like many other Latin sentences supposed to form part of the Roman law, the maxim not only looks more instructive than it really is, but suggests fallacies which it does not precisely state. It is frequently, though ignorantly, supposed to mean that there cannot be such a thing as legal guilt where there is no moral guilt, which is obviously untrue, as there is always a possibility of a conflict between law and morals.&quot;’

was an event in the late fifth century BC, related by the Roman historian Livy. It was a period of Roman history (long before there was a Roman Empire) marked by deep political and social conflict between the patrician and plebeian orders. This disunity naturally impaired the fledgling state’s ability to present a united face to actual or potential enemies abroad. But an incident in 438 or 437 BC had the effect of instantly uniting the Roman people against the neighboring state of Veii. In that year, the ruler of Veii, Lars Tolumnius, ordered the murder of four envoys sent to him from Rome. This deed was described by Livy not merely as an act of “unspeakable brutality” but also as an egregious violation of “the law of nations (ius gentium).”1 The Roman people—plebeian and patrician alike—were as one in their outrage, and war was inevitable. The result was a conflict of some twelve years’ duration, eventuating in a Roman victory


[Alexander] was, at least ostensibly, avenging the Persian invasion of Greece of a century and a half earlier.2 There was no shortage of skepticism as to the validity of this justification. But the crucial point is that it was generally seen to be necessary for even the greatest of conquerors to have justice on their side, as well as the god of battles.

Some biologists have suggested a genetic explanation for altruistic behavior toward relatives.14 Claims have even been made of a specific biochemical basis for parochial altruism: a neuropeptide called oxytocin, which is produced in the human brain and operates as both a neurotransmitter and a hormone. This “love hormone” (as it has sometimes been dubbed) is thought to have originally been associated with mother-infant bonding and later with various other prosocial features such as trust and empathy15—but only within a limited social range. Oxytocin, it has been asserted, also “contributes to the development of intergroup bias and preferential treatment of in-group over out-group members.” It thereby “paves the way

A speaker in one of Plato’s dialogues referred to a general belief that states “are all engaged in a never-ending lifelong war against all other states.” As a result, “what most men call ‘peace’ is really only a fiction, and in cold fact all states are by nature fighting an undeclared war against every other state.”76

The most concrete manifestations of this unity were the periodic intercity gatherings in the form of the great athletic games, of which the most famous, in honor of Zeus, took place at Olympus. As in China, movement of individuals between

Thucydides, in his history of the epic Peloponnesian War (of 431–404 BC) between Athens and Sparta, related a famous instance in which considerations of law or justice played no part. This occurred in 416/15 BC, when Athens refused to respect the wishes of the inhabitants of the island of Melos, originally a Spartan colony, to remain neutral. The pleas of the Melians were brushed aside by the Athenian military commanders, who asserted the existence of “a general and necessary law of nature to rule whatever one can.” They warned that following “the path of justice and honor” was likely to prejudice the higher goals of self-interest and security.

But in all events, a priesthood of persons known as fetials was established in Rome at an early period, and a ritual introduced for inaugurating war. Briefly, it involved the sending of an envoy from Rome to the frontier of the would-be enemy state, where redress of some injury would be publicly demanded according to “religion and justice.” If satisfaction was refused (as was expected), the envoy would return to Rome to seek the opinions of the fetials as to whether war should be declared. If the fetials expressly approved of the waging of “just and righteous war” over the issue in question—and it would appear that they always did—then one of their number would himself go to the enemy’s frontier, bearing a spear. He would make a formal announcement of the war—including the just cause that had given rise to it—and then hurl the spear into the enemy’s territory, thereby officially inaugurating the hostilities. Livy records the first use of this procedure as taking place around 625 BC, against the neighboring city of Latium.103 It must not be thought that this fetial procedure went

millennia preceding the dawn of history”11—with the result that the human creature is, by nature, “an intensely tribal animal”12 with a “hardwired propensity to downgrade other-group members.”13

Modern scientists have given the label “parochial altruism” to this phenomenon of being altruistic and cooperative within small groups, while simultaneously hostile to outsiders.9 Konrad Lorenz, the noted Austrian ethologist, suggested that this moral dualism represents two sides of the same biological coin. He contended that animals which are noted for their mutual loyalty within their small groups are especially aggressive toward outsiders. “The proverbially most aggressive of all animals,” he maintained, “Dante’s bestia senza pace [i.e., the wolf] is the most faithful of friends.”10 In a similar vein, the evolutionary biologist Edward O. Wilson has hypothesized that parochial altruism is an innate biological feature of Homo sapiens. “Our instincts,” he suggests, “still desire the tiny, united band-networks that prevailed during the hundreds of


Natural law, to them, was essentially what it had been to Aristotle: a set of norms that were applicable worldwide and not simply to this society or that one. The basic idea was aptly summed up by Cicero, in words attributed to a speaker in a dialogue. Natural law (ius naturale) was described as “right reason in harmony with nature”—as a body of law that was “spread through the whole human community, unchanging and eternal.”
What Ulpian did not explain was whether the ius gentium should be seen as a subcategory of natural law—that is, as that portion of natural law which was applicable uniquely to humans—or whether its content was altogether separate from that of natural law. In all events, though, he was emphatic that the two kinds of law were not identical. Ulpian helpfully provided some illustrative examples. Into the category of natural law, he placed marriage, along with the procreation and rearing of children. Into the category of ius gentium, he placed slavery—carefully noting that, according to natural law, all persons are born free.139 From Hermogenian, a legal writer of the third

The Chinese conception of world order was essentially that of a world state with a single hegemon—the Chinese emperor. The Roman vision was very different. In place of a benevolent universal ruler, it advanced the more abstract, but ultimately more powerful, idea of an impersonal and universal rule of law. Moreover, the Roman legacy of universal law, in both of its incarnations—natural law and the ius gentium—was sharply distinguished from Rome’s own civil (or national) law. This divergence between Chinese and Roman ways proved decisive. It would, eventually, determine that international law would be a product not of China but of Europe. Medieval Europe, however, would be no mere passive recipient of its classical heritage. It would make important innovations of its own.

In a nutshell, it was the idea that there is a body of law above and beyond that of state governments. More than that, though, it was the notion that this law actually constrains governments themselves, just as it constrains ordinary people. This law was not, however, always self-evident, and it was never self-executing. To some modest extent, these shortcomings could be dealt with by the Catholic Church. It possessed highly learned men who could expound the content of the law, and it had various spiritual weapons that it could wield against evildoers in high places. Medieval Europe accordingly had extensive experience in the defining and enforcing of universal standards against governments.

That the Roman emperor—who became officially “Holy” in 1157—was the foremost ruler in Western Europe was not doubted. But the claims that were advanced on his behalf were truly startling: of universal dominion. It was canon lawyers who first asserted that the Holy Roman emperor was the lord of the entire world (dominus mundi) and that, as such, he possessed a residual de jure sovereignty over the entire world. Rulers of the various kingdoms, on this thesis, possessed merely de facto power, which they had somehow wrested from the grasp of the universal monarch. A prominent champion of this theory was the eminent Italian Bartolus of Sassoferrato, one of the most famous and learned lawyers of the Middle Ages.

Between natural law and the Christian religion, there was a certain wariness. To contend that natural law was an adjunct of the Christian faith is very wide of the mark. Natural-law thought long preceded the advent of Christianity and was, in its inception, wholly a product of classical (i.e., Greek and Roman) civilization. It is impossible to overstate the importance of this point. Natural law was not religious either in content or origin, nor did the Christian faith have any privileged status within it. It was a law for the entire world at large, transcending the enormous diversity of the various human societies. At the same time, it is true that only Western European civilization devised such a body of thought. Indeed, natural law deserves to rank highly among the most distinctive features of Western civilization. What should be carefully appreciated, though, is that, even if the origin of natural-law thought was thoroughly and distinctively Western, the content of the law was held to be applicable worldwide. Natural law, in short, was a radically cosmopolitan, universalist corpus of thought. In this important respect, European civilization was sharply different from other societies. China had no such conception of natural law in the sense of a body of law applicable equally to all societies. The Chinese view was that China’s own society was innately superior to all others, and hence that other societies were to be evaluated according to how nearly they conformed to Chinese ways. It will be seen that much the same ethos prevailed in the Islamic world, where the one body of law was held to govern the true believers, with infidels left to their own devices—and with no “master law” governing both.

 It will be recalled that, to Aristotle, sociability was a “natural impulse” of humans—hardwired into the human biogram. It was automatically and inescapably part of the human condition.31 Under the rationalist scheme, however, that confidence was in danger of being lost. Aquinas salvaged it as best he could by simply positing that the rules of natural law are compatible with “our natural inclinations”—and that among these is “a natural inclination … to live in society” and “to avoid giving offence to those among whom one has to live.”32 Natural-law thought, therefore, even in its newer rationalist form, managed to retain the traditional commitment to the principle of the natural sociability of humankind. The world is, in this picture, fundamentally harmonious and orderly rather than chaotic and violent.

The first theory, which we will call the “dualist” approach, held the two bodies of law to be more or less wholly distinct. The second school of thought, to be labeled the “substitution” theory, held the ius gentium to be a kind of second-rate substitute for natural law. Finally, the “emanationist” school (as it is being termed) held the two to be very closely connected, to the point that the ius gentium was actually a logical derivation from natural law. Of the three schools of thought concerning the relationship between natural law and the ius gentium, the dualistic one posited the sharpest distinction. It held that the two bodies of law differed from one another in two key respects. The first was that the ius gentium was a human creation, while natural law was not. The second key difference—and the one justifying the label—was that the two bodies of law applied to different subject areas or spheres of activity. Of the three theories, this one bore the clearest mark of the Roman law origin of the ius gentium. In fact, it was basically
 Things covered by natural law pertain largely to the conduct of individual persons, such as marriage, the bringing up of families, and the fending off of assaults. Things falling into the ambit of the ius gentium, in contrast, are activities of states, including various aspects of war making and peacemaking.
clear enough. The ius gentium is a man-made law, but only in the very restricted sense that it is humans, rather than animals, who are able to employ reason and thereby to discover what natural law requires in a variety of specific cases. The effect, then, is that natural law comprises the broad general principles, and the ius gentium the conclusions which logically flow from them. Employing a geometric analogy, we would say that natural law corresponds to the axioms, and the ius gentium to the theorems—with the two being, of course, intimately connected by an unbreakable chain of hypothetico-deductive reasoning.

Nevertheless, broad agreement evolved on a fivefold schema of just-war doctrine, first set out in the early thirteenth century by Raymond of Peñaforte, a Spanish Dominican who taught canon law at the University of Bologna.46 The five elements—all five which had to be satisfied—may be identified briefly (in no special order). One element was auctoritas. This meant that war could be waged justly only by a sovereign or by a subject at the command of a sovereign. It could not be done by subjects on their own initiative. A second element was personae. This meant that certain persons were prohibited from participation in war, no matter how clearly just the cause was. Most importantly, this meant that clerics were barred from belligerent activity.47 Third was the requirement of res. This word, meaning simply “thing” in Latin, signified that the war had to have a defined goal or purpose—that the “thing” being fought over must be precisely identified. The clear implication was that, once this defined goal was attained, the war must stop. This principle, then, had the function of preventing a war from dragging on or degenerating into a conflict driven simply by the mutual hatred of the parties for one another. A fourth element of the schema—and in some ways at the very heart of the just-war idea—was the requirement of iusta causa. This meant literally a “just cause.” It should be noted that it meant a just cause in a strictly objective sense. In the dispute over the res, the just side is the one with the stronger legal case. It is not sufficient to fight in good faith, in the sincere belief that the law is on one’s side. The law must actually be on one’s side, or the war is unjust. In legal terminology, it would be said that there is strict liability on this point, meaning simply that no allowance is made for subjective considerations such as good faith.
The fifth and final element of the schema was animus. This referred to the subjective mental state of the combatant, though not to his opinion about the justice of his cause. Instead, it was a requirement that a fighter in a just war must do battle without personal animosity toward his foe. His battle must be against wrongdoing as such, and not against the wrongdoers as individuals. Here is the reflection, in just-war theory, of the Christian command to love one’s enemies. A just war should be seen as an enterprise in correction and instruction, and not in vengeance or bloodlust. War waged for greed or glory or for love of violence is unjust, even if the requisite iusta causa is present.

This was in marked contrast to the Christian idea of government as being, at best, a necessary evil—an instrument for suppressing or policing the basic depravity of the human character. Another Aristotelian political philosophy, with its key notion that states or governments are natural phenomena—and also are vehicles for the attainment of the fulfilling life.

Marsilius of Padua. Neither a lawyer nor a theologian, his professional training was in medicine. He supported Louis of Bavaria in his unsuccessful claim to the Holy Roman emperorship. More memorably, he wrote a major work of political theory, Defensor pacis (The Defender of Peace), in 1324.More than any other medieval writer, Marsilius dispensed with the idea of natural law. He did not reject the concept in principle, but he recognized it only as “the science or doctrine of right” and not as actual law. Law in the proper sense, he insisted, is “a command coercive through punishment or reward … in the present world.”71 The fundamental source of law, accordingly, is not reason but the will of the party promulgating it. Moreover, an indispensable sign of law is the omnipresent exposure to a sanction or punishment for its violation—just what natural law lacked. This is the clearest expression in the medieval era of what would later be termed the positivist conception of the law.

In all events, Valverde’s accounts of his experiences made a great impression on his hosts, and on one of them in particular. This was a monk named Francisco de Vitoria, who up until then had taken little or no interest in New World affairs.1 He was a theologian, chiefly distinguished as a leading figure in the sixteenth-century revival of the philosophy of that earlier Dominican, Thomas Aquinas. Vitoria hailed from a prominent family in Burgos. He studied in Paris in the early years of the sixteenth century, especially the works of Aquinas, and then returned to Spain to teach theology, first at the College of San Gregorio in Valladolid. He then moved to the University of Salamanca, where he held the prime chair in theology and expounded the works of Aquinas. He had connections in prominent humanist circles, being a personal friend of the noted Spanish humanist Luis de Vives and a defender of the famous scholar and polemicist Erasmus of Rotterdam from attacks by conservatives.

Vitoria was very impressed by the stories related by Valverde—though not in the manner intended. He was shocked by what he heard, and the more that he learned about the conduct of the Spanish in the New World, the more horrified he became. Later in 1534, he wrote in a private letter that “no business shocks me or embarrasses me more than the corrupt profits and affairs of the Indies. Their very mention freezes the blood in my veins.”2 In 1539, he went public with his concerns, delivering a memorable set of lectures, known as a “relection,” entitled De Indis (On the American Indians). In these, he discussed various issues largely from the standpoint of natural law and just-war doctrine. Vitoria’s conclusions, in some ways, were not so radical. He did accept that, in principle, the Spanish might have had some just cause for war against the Indians. But he doubted whether that amounted to a right of outright conquest and annexation of the Indian realms.

However impressive the Islamic conquests of the seventh and eighth Centuries, they fell far short of encompassing the entire world. It has been observed that, in the case of Christian Europe, an alternative universalist vision was offered by natural-law doctrine. On this point, the Islamic world offered a very striking contrast. Natural law was one notable element of the Greek and Roman classical heritage that did not have a great impact on Muslim thought.4 Where the natural-law tradition insisted on an ultimate and fundamental unity of the entire human race, the Islamic faith held there to be a deep moral chasm between believers and infidels. In order to be truly moral, in Muslim eyes, it was necessary to be a Muslim and, by extension, to know and live by the Muslim law, the sharia.5 It is true that the Muslim faith did not countenance active mistreatment of infidels merely on the basis of nonbelief. On the contrary, “people of the Book” (meaning Jews and Christians plus, in practice, Zoroastrians) were to be tolerated. But this was a toleration liberally flavored by condescension. Infidels were regarded as moral inferiors and were subject to various disabilities, such as special taxation.

The Aristotelian view, which was especially influential in the Dominican Order of monks (which included Aquinas), was fundamentally hostile to ideas of universal dominion and correspondingly supportive of ideas of mutual independence of states—with implications of non intervention by states in the affairs of one another.67 Aristotelianism, in short, was a philosophy of pluralism that directly challenged the universalist theses of empire and papacy. An expression of this new Aristotelian outlook can be found in the writing of a Dominican named John of Paris (Jean Quidort), who wrote in the late thirteenth century, in the generation after Aquinas. John was an avowed pluralist, maintaining that, because of the complexity of political life and secular power, it is not possible for universalism to reign in that sphere of life, as it can (and should) in the religious one. Different peoples have different modes of life, and there must therefore be different governments to accommodate them. Consequently, it is both necessary and desirable that there be a multiplicity of kingdoms.68 “There can be many different ways of living,” asserted John, “and different kinds of state conforming to differences in climate, language, and the conditions of men, with what is suitable for one nation not so for another.” He concluded, expressly invoking the authority of Aristotle, that “development of individual states and kingdoms is natural, [while] that of an empire or [universal] monarchy is not.”69

The Islamic ideal was that the Muslim world should comprise a single community of believers, united in a single polity and governed by sharia, the Islamic religious law. Within that world, there could be, in principle, no such thing as international law. Relations with the infidel world were, however, a different matter. The Quran, the sacred book of the Islamic faith, did not itself offer much guidance. But a body of law known as siyar gradually grew up to deal with such issues. (Siyar is the plural of the Arabic word sirah, which simply means conduct or behavior.)6 We must beware of thinking of the Islamic siyar in terms of our modern conception of international law because it was seen as a law exclusively for Muslims, not for infidels. It was a body of rules that instructed Muslim rulers on how they were to behave toward non believers. In modern parlance, it would be characterized as the Muslim law of foreign relations, rather than as international law per se.7

Since siyar was seen as part of Islamic law, it followed that it must, in principle at least, flow from the same sources as Muslim law generally. In practice, however, that was not really the case, since the traditional sources of Islamic law had too little to offer in the way of substantive rules of conduct. Siyar was therefore, to a large extent, separate from other branches of Muslim law, being derived largely from custom and from reason rather than from the prescriptions of the Quran or practices of the Prophet Muhammad (which were, and still are, the two

In an important sense, then, all Muslim wars against infidel powers—offensive and defensive alike—were regarded as, per se, just, provided that an invitation to convert was given prior to the launching of hostilities.

For all of these activities, the hardiness of the pioneer and the bravado of the warrior were greatly in demand. So too, however, were the skills of a more subtle and unobtrusive group of persons: lawyers. One of the challenges facing medieval lawyers was to determine the legal bases for these various external adventures. This was especially problematic for two of the four regions of expansion: the Holy Land and northeastern Europe. An important part of the lawyers’ task was to decide what kind of entitlement to govern was possessed by the preexisting rulers—who in all cases were non-Christians. In dealing with these vital issues, natural-law doctrine was summoned to assist.

Since natural law applied to all members of the human race (and even to the entire animal kingdom, in Ulpian’s version), there was no doubt that non-Christians were fully entitled to be owners of private property. More problematic was whether they had a right to exercise rulership, particularly over Christian subjects. There was a powerful strain of thought in Western Europe to the effect that pagans could not possess title to lands. This was the opinion of Hostiensis (also known as Henry of Segusio), who taught canon law at the University of Paris during the thirteenth century. In 1253, he contended that, “with the advent of Christ all offices and princely ranks … have with just cause been withdrawn from all heathen and transferred to Christians.”28 Giles of Rome, who was archbishop of Bourges and a follower of Thomas Aquinas, insisted, in this same vein, that a person cannot be “the lord of anything or … possess anything with justice unless he is also spiritually regenerated through the Church.”29 Aquinas himself held a somewhat more moderate stance: that, if sovereignty by an infidel ruler over Christians was “an established fact,” then it could be allowed to continue—but that it was subject to revocation by the church at any time. The reason, he explained, was that “infidels by their infidelity deserve to forfeit power over the faithful.”30

But this position did not, in the event, win official favor. The decisive contribution to the debate was made in 1243 by Pope Innocent IV (Frederick II’s nemesis).31 Invoking natural law, he pronounced that “[d]ominions, possessions and jurisdictions are lawful and blameless among the infidels, for these were created not only for the faithful, but for all rational creatures.”32 Pagan princes even had a lawful right to rule over territories that had been conquered from prior Christian rulers—with the notable exception (as will be seen) of the Holy Land in the Middle East. This natural-law right to political dominion was likened, in its universality, to sunshine, which warmed persons of all faiths and cultures alike. For these views, there could be a case for crowning Innocent IV with the contested title of father of international law.33

The logical implication of Innocent’s position was immediately apparent. In order for wars against pagans and infidels to be lawful, they would have to be brought within the framework of general just-war doctrine, or else some kind of alternative justification outside that framework would have to be devised. That posed something of a challenge. But there was no shortage of lawyers prepared to meet it. Justifications for Crusading If traditional just-war theory was to be employed to justify crusading, then a persuasive just cause (iusta causa) would have to be identified. One possible theory was repressive rule by the Saracens (in the form of persecution of Christians), which could be argued to justify forfeiture of their right to rule. This was put forward, admittedly not in very dispassionate legal terms, at the outset of the crusading movement to the Holy Land. The famous sermon by Pope Urban II at Clermont in 1095, in one of the versions in which it has been reported (supposedly firsthand), contained an extensive catalogue of atrocities attributed to the Muslims. These included the devastation of the Holy Land with “pillage, fire, and the sword,” the infliction of “cruel tortures” onto Christians, the destruction of churches, and the ruining of altars with “filth and defilement.”34

In the longer term, however, allegations of misconduct by infidel rulers lost their persuasiveness, and resort was had to two other theories that were devised outside the framework of general just-war theory. One of them, known as recuperatio (“recovery”), was applied to crusading in the Holy Land. The other, known as dilatatio (“expansion” or “widening,” cognate with the English word “dilate”), applied to the northeastern European crusading theater. The recuperatio theory was the more widely accepted of the two, since it had the support of Innocent IV himself. It held that the Holy Land must be seen as something of a special case. It was stated to be, uniquely, a res sancta (“sacred thing”) belonging, in permanent right, to the whole of Christendom. That meant that any infidel rulership over it could never be regarded as legitimate. Consequently, any Christian prince was entitled to reconquer it on behalf of the Christian community generally.35 Among the writers who supported this doctrine were John of Legnano and Bonet.36

The dilatatio theory was more controversial. It was essentially a Christian version of the Muslim thesis, identified earlier, that the conquest of foreign lands was justifiable as a means to the effective promotion of the true faith. Conquest of a non-Christian land could be authorized (the theory went) on the condition that the conquerors convert their new subjects to the Catholic faith after gaining control. The distinctive feature of this doctrine was the absence of any requirement of prior wrongdoing on the part of the infidel rulers. It should also be noted that, as in Islamic belief, the actual conversion of the population was still required to be voluntary, so that the dilatatio principle did not amount, strictly speaking, to forcible conversion. But it justified the employment of force as

an ancillary—and prior—aid to conversion. The dilatatio theory was not invoked in the original proclamation of the northeastern crusade by Pope Eugenius III in 1147. It first emerged in the context of European occupation of the Canary Islands in the fourteenth century. In 1344, Pope Clement VI made a grant of the islands to a certain Luis de La Cerda, a Spanish native who had transferred his allegiance to France. La Cerda’s grant included the enviable title of “Prince of the Fortunate Isles.”37 He was thereby authorized to conquer and rule the islands but was also instructed to employ his powers to promote conversion of the native population to Christianity.38 The following year, Clement VI conferred the status of crusade onto La Cerda’s plans for conquest. As it happened, La Cerda never embarked on the conquest of his felicitous principality. But the concept of dilatatio

the fact that nonadherence to the Christian religion was simply not, per se, a violation of natural law. Consequently, non-Christians could not be deprived of their natural-law rights on the ground of their status as nonbelievers.

Three years later, in 1455, Nicholas V followed this up with another bull, Romanus Pontifex (“Roman Priest”).62 This granted to Portugal “the right of conquest” of a somewhat vaguely defined portion of Africa extending through “all Guinea and beyond toward that southern shore.” The king of Portugal was given the right “to invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue all Saracens and pagans whatsoever, and other enemies of Christ wheresoever placed … and to reduce their persons to perpetual slavery.” He was also authorized to legislate and to levy taxes in the area. Trade with Saracens was permitted except in materials useful for war. Penalties for infringement of this grant were specified: excommunication for individuals, interdict for communities. The following year, Pope Callixtus III, in a bull entitled Inter Caetera (“Among Other [Works]”), reaffirmed Nicholas V’s grant and supplemented it by giving sole ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the area to the Order of Jesus Christ (a military order, of which Prince Henry was governor).63

The papal-grant theory received strong support at a junta held at the Dominican monastery of San Pablo in Valladolid in 1513. The occasion was the dispatching of an expedition to Panama, under the command of Pedro Arias de Ávila (often known as Pedrarias Dávila), to relieve Balboa of his command. King Ferdinand of Spain ordered its departure to be delayed, pending a consideration of the question of just wars against the natives by a committee of theologians. Two of the more noteworthy participants at this session were Matías de Paz and Juan López de Palacios Rubios. Paz was a Dominican friar and professor of theology at the University of Salamanca. Palacios Rubios was a distinguished lawyer and member of the Council of Castile. Paz set out this thesis in an exposition entitled De Domino Regum Hispaniae super Indios (On the Dominion of the Spanish King over the Indies). This was noteworthy in relying on the papal grants as the sole basis of legal title of the Spanish monarchs.76 The views of Palacios Rubios were expounded in a work entitled De Insulis Oceanus (On the Islands of the Ocean Sea). He contended that, even granting the position of Innocent IV that pagan princes possessed lawful sovereignty, that sovereignty could be revoked from them by the pope and transferred to other rulers (i.e., the Spanish crown).77 Neither of these

Palacios Rubios did not shrink from the full logical consequences of his thesis. It meant that the Spanish crown had sovereignty over the New World territories even prior to the conquests on the ground. The task of the Spanish in the New World was therefore to inform the natives that they now had a new sovereign in the hope that they would quietly accept the new state of affairs. If they proved uncooperative on this point, then they could be lawfully subdued by force—as rebels against their lawful sovereign, not as subjects of an independent foreign prince.

To facilitate this process of taking control of territories already granted, Palacios Rubios outlined a procedure that became known as the requerimiento. It appears to have been modeled on prior Islamic practices, which the Spanish became aware of during their reconquista of the Iberian peninsula.78 In essence, the “requirement” was a summons or ultimatum that was read out to the population of the area that the Spanish were intending to conquer. It informed the people that the Spanish were now their lawful sovereigns and called upon them to accept this state of affairs. As such, it has been derided by one modern historian as “surely the crassest example of legalism in modern European history”79 and by another, scarcely more gently, as “a strange blend of ritual, cynicism, legal fiction, and perverse idealism.”80 The text of the requerimiento began with a (necessarily brief) recitation of the history of the world. This included the key information that the pope had been made “lord and superior to all the men in the world” by God and that he had allocated the lands of the Indians to the monarchs of Castile. The hearers were invited to inspect the documents proving this, if they so wished. They were then called upon to “acknowledge the Church as the ruler and superior of the whole world” and the Spanish monarchs as their “lords and kings” and to permit Christian clerics to preach the faith. They were expressly assured that they would not be compelled to convert to Christianity against their own wishes. But they were required to acknowledge their political subjection to their new sovereign. If they refused (the Indians were told), the Spanish would “forcefully enter into your country and … make war against you … and … subject you to the yoke and obedience of the Church” and of the Spanish monarchs. Slavery and confiscation of property would follow.81 A notary was to be present to record in writing that the requerimiento had been duly issued.

The first recorded employment of the requerimiento in the field was in 1514 on the Caribbean coast of what is now Colombia. It appears to have been taken fairly lightheartedly by the Spaniards on that occasion, with stories of its being read out to trees and empty huts or intoned from the decks of ships as they approached Indian territories. But there was no significant contemporary opposition to it.82 It was dutifully employed by Hernán Cortés in his famous conquest of Mexico in 1519–22.83 It may have been read out to the Incans in 1532 in Cajamarca, by Pizarro’s chaplain Valverde—who was later to sojourn at San Esteban—although there was doubt on the point.84 The requerimiento continued to be employed until the 1540s. Its last use appears to have been in a campaign against Chichimec Indians in Mexico in 1542. It was read out on that occasion by a friar who stood prudently out of arrowshot range of the Indians—but probably beyond the range of audibility, too.85

From a legal standpoint, the requerimiento was far from airtight. To be effective, it would have to be heard and understood by the native populations. Making the requerimiento audible over a significant distance would have presented a challenge. Comprehension of it would have posed an even greater difficulty, since there is no evidence of the requerimiento’s ever having been translated into any of the native American languages. Unless a translator was ready to hand on the Indian side, the requerimiento could only have been so much incomprehensible gibberish.86 In recognition of this problem, a Spanish ordinance of 1526, promulgated by the Council of the Indies (the governing body for the Spanish colonies in the New World), required its proclamation in the native languages by interpreters.87

One of the doubters was a young scholar named Domingo de Soto, who was working as a teaching assistant to Vitoria at the University of Salamanca—and who would later be his successor in the theology chair there. In a section of his relection De Dominio (On Dominion), in 1534–35, he held that the popes had no power to confer sovereign rights onto the Spanish and Portuguese monarchs.88 Soto’s master, Vitoria, voiced the same conclusion in his De Indis relection of 1539. The pope, he argued, was not the lord of the whole world. He could confer no sovereign powers onto kings and princes “because no one can give what he does not have.”89 He could therefore allocate spheres of missionary activity to Spain and Portugal but could not grant sovereignty.90

Despite these misgivings, the Spanish and Portuguese governments, together with their legal servants, continued throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to assert that the papal grants did confer actual sovereignty onto their recipients. The most prominent advocate of this thesis—who has been described as “the chief jurist of the [Spanish] empire”—was the Spanish cleric Juan de Solórzano y Pereira.91 A native of Madrid, he spent twelve years at the University of Salamanca—that veritable hub of New World studies—and then became a professor immediately upon graduation. But the major part of his career was spent in royal service, which included an eighteen-year stint as a judge in the audiencia of Lima (in 1609–27). Upon his return to Spain, he served on the Council of the Indies. His massive study of colonial law, De Indiarum Jure (The Law of the Indies), written in 1629–39, served as the de facto official statement of the Spanish government position on colonial issues. In this work, he insisted firmly on the validity of the papal donation as the basis of Spain’s title.92

An alternative basis of title to the New World territories was acquisition by means of a just war. The Spanish government began to incline in this direction as it reduced its reliance on the requerimiento. A decisive step was the promulgation of a set of ordinances in 1526. These stipulated that all licensed expeditions of conquest must be accompanied by two clerics, and that their prior written consent was a prerequisite to the employment of armed force. If war was waged contrary to this policy, then the expedition contract was to be revoked.93 Remarkably, the constraints imposed by the Spanish government sometimes did have effects on the actual conduct of the conquerors. When the audiencia of Guatemala insisted on adherence to these laws, the would-be conquistador Juan Pérez de Cabrera abandoned his conquest campaign rather than submit.94

First was the obvious problem of determining whether the criteria for just wars were actually met in the cases at hand—that is, whether there really was a iusta causa of the kind required. Second was the question of whether even a just war could entail a right of outright conquest. The weakness of the Spanish case on both of these counts was exposed by Vitoria in his two famous relections of 1539. Vitoria devoted the bulk of his attention to the question of iusta causa. A thorough analysis of this issue was his most distinctive contribution to the debates over the Americas. He began by endorsing the standard canon-law position (going back to Innocent IV) that, prior to the Spaniards’ arrival, the Indians possessed lawful dominion over their lands.95 He then carefully considered a list of seven possible justifications for war against the Indians, finding all of them unpersuasive after close argument. Among these “unjust titles” (as he called them) were the punishment of violations of natural law, the claiming of title by right of discovery, and purported grants of sovereignty by an emperor or pope.96 These were regarded as altogether invalid in principle as justifications for war.

Without mentioning the requerimiento explicitly, Vitoria included among his unjust titles a failure on the natives’ part to convert to Christianity upon hearing “a simple announcement” of the faith. Only if the Indians refused to convert in the face of “miraculous signs or other reasons for belief” could compulsion be used—that is, if they positively repudiated the Christian faith rather than merely passively declined to join it. Vitoria added darkly that he had received no information of any such signs. “On the contrary, I hear only of provocations, savage crimes, and multitudes of unholy acts.”97 Vitoria then proceeded to identify eight bases on which, at least in principle, conquest of the Indians could be justified. These included possible violations by the Indians of various rights of the Spanish, such as a right of “natural partnership and communication.” War could also be justified for the purpose of spreading information about the Christian faith, protecting converts, and defending innocent persons against tyrannical rulers. Mental incapacity on the part of foreign peoples could also justify their conquest.98 Vitoria carefully held back, however, from pronouncing on whether any of these justifications had actually been present at the time of the conquests. The nearest that he came was in his endorsement of the lawfulness of assisting allies who were fighting a just war. He cautiously noted that “[t]his is what is said to have happened” during Cortés’s campaign in Mexico, when the Spanish allied themselves with an Indian state that was fighting against the Aztecs.99

There's so much! A lot of the craziest stuff is in the fossil fuel related bills. For example, I've seen multiple bills that make people fly to Washington D.C. to challenge natural gas fracking and fossil fuel pipelines in court and I've seen lots of automatic approvals of permits. There was also a truly scandalous bill that allows US taxpayer bailouts of foreign and domestic banks that trade the riskiest derivatives (the kind that literally crashed the world's economy in 2008). That bill was quietly attached by Rep. Kevin Yoder of Kansas to the 2015 funding law - which President Obama had to sign to prevent another full government shutdown - and is now law. That is still one of the craziest things I've ever seen in my life.

It has been observed that there was significant support for the thesis that the papal awards of the fifteenth century had merely been allocations of spheres of missionary activity and not grants of sovereignty over territory. That did not rule out the possibility, however, that the one might lead to the other. Moreover, there was a readily available legal doctrine tailor-made to accomplish just that intellectual jump: the principle of dilatatio, which was now applied to the New World rather than to northeastern Europe. In the reopened debate over dilatatio, the doctrine was justified on the basis of a more fundamental general principle of law: that, if jurisdiction is granted or a duty imposed, then the party affected must be understood to possess everything necessary to exercise the jurisdiction or perform the duty.113 On this thesis, the Spanish rulers could be entitled to acquire sovereignty over the Indian kingdoms as an adjunct to, or instrument of, the conversion process. This argument is interesting because it effectively conceded that the pope did not directly grant sovereignty to Spain. Instead, he granted the right to acquire sovereignty by means of forcible self-help, if that was necessary to effectuate the task of conversion.

With this argument, Vitoria had considerable sympathy, listing it among the potentially valid bases of Spanish title in his 1539 relection. He conceded that the pope “has power in temporal things insofar as they concern spiritual things.” It was also within the pope’s discretion to entrust evangelization programs to single states exclusively—and that this can even include a monopoly on trading rights “if this is convenient for the spreading of the Christian religion.” He went on to hold that monopoly trading rights in the allocated areas were necessary for the orderly progress of missionary activity and therefore were legally valid. Moreover, popes had the power to “distribute” the territories of Saracens to Christian princes “for the preservation of peace and the progress of religion.” That meant that popes had the power to “make new princes for the furtherance of religion … in places where there had never before been any Christian princes.”114 At the same time, though, Vitoria introduced an important cautionary note. If the Indians, of their own free will, allowed missionaries to come among them and preach, then there would be no need, under the circumstances, for the Spanish to depose their rulers and conquer their kingdoms.115 Not surprisingly, the king of Spain, Charles I (better known in his capacity as Holy Roman Emperor Charles V), was displeased to find his policies publicly questioned by self-appointed critics. He ordered the prior of San Esteban monastery to stop his charges from debating this sensitive matter.116 At the same time, though, Charles revealed that doubts were gnawing away even in governmental circles. In 1550, he ordered a suspension of all conquest expeditions and the convening of a special panel of theologians and advisers, to determine the criteria for the lawful waging of wars of conquest.

Of greater prominence than the panel members were the opposing advocates. Arguing against the policy of conquest in the service of conversion was a Dominican bishop named Bartolomé de las Casas. He was the most renowned champion of the rights of the native populations of the New World. Originally from a prominent merchant family of Seville, he emigrated with his father to Hispaniola in the West Indies in 1502, during his teens. There, he became a plantation owner, employing local Indians as slave labor and even participating in military expeditions and slave raids against the Indians. But his life’s vocation was to lie in a dramatically different direction. In 1510, he became a priest, the first to be ordained in the New World. The decisive change in his life, though, took place the following year, when he attended an eloquent sermon by a Dominican friar named Antonio de Montesinos, who denounced mistreatment of the native peoples of the Americas by the Spaniards.117 Las Casas was thereby inspired to enter the Dominican order himself and to make the welfare of the Indian population the great mission of his life.

He presented the panel with a 550-page treatise (Argumentum apologiae), which appears to have been an early version of his major work, In Defense of the Indians. It argued against the Spanish policies and in favor of a strategy of winning natives over to the Christian religion exclusively by peaceful means. On the question of the law applicable to the conquest of pagan peoples, las Casas closely followed Vitoria. Like his predecessor, he conceded the existence of a number of just grounds for war, including forcible occupation of Christian lands, impeding the preaching of the truth faith, and waging aggressive war against Christians. But he was more explicit than Vitoria had been in his emphatic denial, based on firsthand knowledge, that any of these abominable acts had actually been committed by the Indians.121

He took a similar approach to dilatatio. Like Vitoria, he basically conceded its validity. But he went on to argue that it could only serve as a justification for conquest if the acquisition of sovereignty was, in fact, truly necessary to effectuate conversion. In his opinion, it was not necessary.

Sepúlveda advanced four arguments in support of the Spanish conquest policy. The first was that the various sins committed by the Indians (including idolatry and sundry sins against nature) justified war against them. Second was the classic Aristotelian argument that the base nature of the Indians made them naturally suitable for the role of servants to the more advanced and civilized Spaniards. Third was the dilatatio principle. And finally, he argued that Spanish rule provided increased protection to weak and vulnerable natives.123 It is noteworthy that none of these arguments alleged the commission of any offense by the Indians against the Spanish specifically, though the first one rested on violations of general natural law.

If the great debate at Valladolid had little immediate impact, the position of las Casas won official favor in the longer run, largely as a result of the work of a lawyer named Gregorio López de Tovar. Originally from Guadalupe in Spain and educated at Salamanca, he served the Spanish government in various high capacities, including the important post of president of the Council of the Indies (in 1543–60) at the time of the Valladolid debate. He appears never to have visited the New World, but he was married to the niece of Francisco Pizarro.

López’s position was incorporated, in 1573, into a new legal ordinance regulating the conquest process.127 Henceforth, the word “conquest” was to be eschewed altogether, in favor of “pacification.” In dealings with Indian groups, the positive benefits of Spanish rule were to be stressed. But it was also provided that, if the natives were to oppose Spanish settlement and the preaching of the Christian faith, then force could be used against them.128

King Francis I of France is said to have scornfully remarked that he “should be very happy to see the clause in Adam’s will which excluded me from my share when the world was being divided.”137 The English government, not surprisingly, took much the same view.

The essence of the English case was that the Spanish had a right to undisturbed possession of whatever lands they actually controlled, but that they did not have a true legal title to other areas. Discovery of the lands did not, on its own, confer title. Vitoria shared this opinion. Discovery “of itself,” he insisted, “provides no support for the possession of these lands, any more than it would if they [the native rulers] had discovered us.”140 King Francis I of France was of a similar mind. “To pass by and eye,” he grumbled, “is no title of possession.”141 The conclusion to be drawn from this was clear: that until and unless the Spanish actually took permanent possession of lands and continuously governed them, other powers were free to step in, even if the Spanish had

law. Later generations (as will be seen) would adopt different terminology for what Suárez called the ius gentium proper. They would label it the “voluntary” (or “volitional”) law of nations. Later, it would more commonly be called the “positive” law of nations. The important point, though, is that Suárez was the first (since Isidore) to articulate the idea of a corpus of man-made international law alongside—and distinct from—natural law, and devoted specifically to the sphere of interstate relations.

Grotius’s conception of natural law, like Suárez’s, was squarely in the line of rationalist thought from the Middle Ages. His definition of natural law as “a dictate of right reason” was virtually identical to that of Aquinas.52 He explicitly voiced a preference for a mathematical approach to the subject, with conclusions rigorously derived from axioms in the manner of Euclidean geometry.53 He clearly distinguished natural law from divine law, which consisted of the commands of God. Natural law, as a purely logical system, was stated to be entirely self-standing, owing nothing to God.54 In a famous statement in his prologue, Grotius went so far as to assert that, even if there were no God at all, natural law would still exist in its full and complete form.55

security, as a primary natural-law right was nothing new. Aquinas had said as much.86 The key difference was that, for Aquinas, self-preservation had been only one of three core natural-law principles (the other two being the nurturing of the young and, crucially, the quest for harmonious social life).

For Hobbes, security was, in effect, the sole basic natural right. It authorized each individual person to take whatever steps are necessary to preserve his existence in a turbulent world. At the root of the Hobbesian “war of all against all” is the regrettable fact that opinions of people will differ as to how far they are entitled to go in exercising this right, with the melancholy result that the various individual rights of survival will clash with one another. Hobbes was, however, able to offer a means of escape from this living hell. This was by harnessing the one and only fundamental duty of natural law: the obligation to adhere to contracts that are freely entered into. Pacta sunt servanda was the standard Latin formulation of this principle: “Pacts must be observed.” The state of nature may have provided nothing that could be said to resemble an ordered human society, but it was within the power of humans to create such a society for themselves, by means of contracts. The way that this could come about, Hobbes posited, was for various individuals to enter into a contract with one another, pursuant to which they would all cede or transfer their natural-law right of self-rule to some third party—who would thereby become the sovereign of a politically ordered society. This sovereign would then have the task of providing for the collective survival of the contractors by making use of the pool of rights that they had conferred onto him.87

This came about as a result of the unsuitability of natural-law doctrine to a world in which powerful central governments were emerging, based in territorial states. In certain respects, to be sure, natural law was eminently suited to serve as a basis of law between sovereigns. Since natural law was radically cosmopolitan in character, it could, without any difficulty, be held to be applicable in the furthest corners of the earth, to every single kind of human society. No law, surely, could be more truly international than that. In other respects, however, natural law was profoundly ill equipped to deal with practical questions of international relations. The reason is that natural law was, from its inception, always seen as basically a set of rules about interpersonal relations rather than about interstate relations. Nowhere is this more evident than in discussions of the law of self-defense, which focused principally on the rights of individuals to use force when assailed by a wrongdoer.

The implications of Hobbes’s ideas for international law were many. One of them—and the one that has attracted the most attention—is that the political sovereignty created by this process was effectively absolute (or, at a minimum, very nearly so). This was because the contracting parties have given up the overwhelming share of their natural-law rights to the sovereign in exchange 

The first was it now became possible to think, more clearly than before, of a state as an entity that was quite distinct from its members—and, more importantly, as an entity with rights, duties, and interests of its own, which are different from, and superior to, those of its members. “A city,” declared Hobbes, “is one person, whose will, by the compact of many men, is to be received for the will of them all.”88 Where the Aristotelian city-state and the Italian communes had been seen as associations between citizens, the Hobbesian state was regarded as a sovereign above its subjects, and distinct from them. For this reason, it was Hobbes, far more than Bodin, who acted as the herald angel of modern conceptions of state sovereignty. It is immediately apparent that this gathering

This brings us to the second major implication for international law of the Hobbesian system. That is, that the sole legal tie between states is provided by natural law. Here, it must be remembered that the Hobbesian state of nature—in which the states of the world lived vis-à-vis one another—was far from harmonious. Its core feature was conflict. Strictly speaking, despite the use of some memorably lurid language, Hobbes did not really see humans as relentlessly bloodthirsty monsters. His state of nature was slightly more abstract than that. It was a condition in which the basic rights of persons (i.e., of states) overlap worryingly, without any means for drawing a sharp line to determine where one party’s right of survival begins and another’s ends. Drawing such sharp lines is the function of a sovereign—but the international arena possesses no sovereign. Consequently, there is an omnipresent potential for conflict, even when actual material warfare is absent. It was this omnipresent potential that Hobbes regarded as a state of continuous war. In principle, there would seem to be no reason that Hobbes’s contractual solution could not be applied at the collective level of state-to-state relations as well as to the individual level. On this view, smaller states would band together into larger ones, and then larger ones into yet larger ones until, eventually, the whole world was comprised in a single sovereign state. Hobbes did not, however, envisage that this would occur. It was still possible, though, for at least a semblance of international order to be brought about by deft employment of the basic natural-law duty to adhere to contracts. States could enter into treaties with one another—treaties that they would then be under a natural-law duty to fulfill.

Hobbesian vision of international order was indelibly marked by two crucial features. First, it was a world that was intrinsically conflictual rather than harmonious. Peaceful and orderly relations between states were not impossible, but they had to be painstakingly and consciously constructed by purely human initiative, from below. There might be islands of order, but they are protrusions from an ambient ocean of conflict, whether actual or potential. The second crucial feature of the Hobbesian international world was that any orderliness must be entirely treaty-based (although treaties did not necessarily have to be in the form of written documents, with fancy lead seals). There was no detailed body of substantive natural-law principles to guide the statesmen of the world.

One of Zouche’s contributions to international law was the invention of an early version of what became the modern name for the subject (albeit in the Latin tongue). In place of the received expression “ius gentium,” he suggested substituting “ius inter gentes.” That is, he favored speaking of a “law between nations” instead of a “law of nations.” The reason behind this proposed change was to make it clear that the law governing relations between states was importantly different from the original Roman-law ius gentium, which Zouche correctly explained to be merely “the common element in the law” in transactions between individuals.

d Politics (1670), followed by A Treatise on Politics, published posthumously in 1677. These writings were in a strongly Hobbesian vein. He followed Hobbes in holding that only natural law governed relations between states.108 “[S]ince … the right of the sovereign is simply the right of nature itself,” asserted Spinoza, “two states are in the same relation to one another as two men in the condition of nature.” He flatly pronounced states to be “enemies by nature.”109 If anything, he was even more radical than Hobbes in that he denied the existence of an absolute duty to observe treaties. Once the motive for concluding an agreement disappears—that is, once there ceases to be any advantage in adhering to a treaty—a state has a “full right,” he maintained, to break it.110 The reason is that a ruler owes a higher duty to his own subjects to protect their “safety and advantage” than he does to fellow sovereigns to adhere to agreements.111 Spinoza, however, was exceptional in his

The writing of Pufendorf aptly illustrates the marginal significance attached by the naturalists to treaties. He compared them to contracts in civil law. Just as contracts are private obligations between citizens without being part of the general law of the state itself, so are individual treaties merely private arrangements between states, and hence not component parts of a general law of nations. Some treaties, he conceded, replicated provisions of natural law and, on that basis, could perhaps be said to be something more than mere private arrangements. But he had an especially low opinion of treaties of this sort, on the ground that they risked detracting from natural law. “[C]ivilized men,” he grumbled, “should almost be ashamed to be a party to a pact the articles of which say no more than they may not clearly and directly violate the law of nature, as if without such a pact a man would not be sufficiently mindful of his duty.”118

The spider represented speculative thought, in which a writer spins out ideas from within his own mind, in the manner of a spider spinning out silk from its own glands. The ant represented mere mechanical conduct, the mindless piling up of facts without any theoretical guidance, like the ants piling up food for the winter. In between—and much the best of the three—was the way of the bee, which involved gathering in material from the outside world, but then transforming it qualitatively into something more useful.1

There is no law of nations outside of the customs followed by nations and the obligations contracted by States. —THÉOPHILE FUNCK-BRENTANO AND ALBERT SOREL

BY 1814–15, French revolutionaries and their grand principles were in very bad odor—at least in the eyes of the governments of the allied states that had defeated revolutionary (and imperial) France, after more than twenty arduous years of war. Among the products of the revolution that the victorious powers were determined to bury were appeals to natural rights against established authority. It had become all too apparent how much damage could be done by persons whom the British politician and polemicist Edmund Burke derided as “speculatists,” with their grandiose plans for the wholesale replacement of a corrupt present with a rational future.1 Burke had nothing but scorn for “those extravagant and presumptuous speculations” that lead revolutionary leaders “to despise all their predecessors, and all their contemporaries.”2 The proper course of action, in his opinion, is to build on the solid basis of the past, and always with due regard to the concrete realities of human experience. International lawyers in the nineteenth century—an unrevolutionary group if ever there was one—largely followed Burke’s advice. Ironically, in so doing they made a revolution of their own. The monarch they overthrew was not, however, of human flesh. It was natural law. It is true that natural law had been gradually loosening its grip over lawyers—at least those of the Grotian persuasion—throughout the eighteenth century. But the nineteenth-century positivists went a decisive step further, by rejecting natural law wholesale and in principle, instead of merely reducing their reliance on it, as writers like Bynkershoek and Martens had previously done. International lawyers would now, for the first time, begin to congregate at the extreme pragmatic end of the international-law spectrum. The age of the ants had arrived. This principled rejection of natural law 

An interesting challenge to this dualist picture is a situation in which a state is prohibited by its national law from doing something that is required of it by international law. An example would be a treaty that required extradition of any person, regardless of nationality, matched against a constitutional ban on the extradition of nationals to foreign states. When the extradition of a national of the state is sought, a direct conflict between the two obligations occurs. Which law prevails in such a case? Anzilotti was ready with an answer to this. He contended that, strictly speaking, the apparent contradiction is only an illusion. The reason is that, within each of the two systems—considered independently of one another—there is no contradiction. International law unambiguously requires one outcome, while national law, equally unambiguously, requires another. There is therefore no clash between the two systems of law, as such.49 It remains the case, though, that the state is in a dilemma. If it adheres to its constitution, then it must breach its treaty obligation. Conversely, if it fulfills the treaty obligation, then it must violate the constitution. The government of the state therefore cannot avoid making an agonizing choice between these two courses of action. Anzilotti’s point, however, is that it is the state itself that faces this dilemma, not either of the two systems of law. The legal systems both remain free of ambiguity or contradiction—and resolutely independent of one another. The real “solution” to this dilemma, then, is that governments should be scrupulously vigilant and take the utmost care that they do not carelessly incur incompatible obligations. The situation at hand, in other words, is merely a demonstration of government negligence, not o

Concerning the common-will version of positivism in general, it may be objected—and it was—that it is not really properly positivist at all. The reason is that the necessary basis of this system is the underlying principle of adherence to contracts (pacta sunt servanda). And this core principle, it may be argued, can only be a principle of natural law. It had been so regarded since at least the time of Hobbes. It may be contended, therefore, that the common will merely determines the content of legal obligations, and that it is the natural-law principle of pacta sunt servanda which actually makes agreements legally binding on the parties. Triepel accommodated this critique by conceding that international law rests, ultimately, on a nonpositivist foundation—not on natural law, but rather on general human psychology.

So high a value did the neo-Hegelian writers place on state sovereignty that they insisted that what was commonly referred to as “international law” was, in reality, merely the sovereign state’s own national law applied to the area of foreign relations—often called “external state law” (Das äussere Staatsrecht), on the precedent of Hegel himself.56 This reflected the essence of the voluntarist position: that the individual sovereigns of each state are the sole authorities who can make or accept law for that state, and that no external agency can impose legal obligations on a state against its will. It is not difficult to see that this approach comes extremely close to denying the possibility of international law altogether. It may be noted that this voluntarist theory entails the rejection of the dualist outlook of the common-will school. (In general, the voluntarists were scornful opponents of the common-will adherents.) According to the voluntarists, the difference in subject matter between domestic law and international law is merely a superficial one. Fundamentally, to the voluntarists, all law is the product of a single source: the will of single, individual states. Consequently, there can be no fundamental difference between national and international law.

From the basic rejection of natural law, combined with the image of international law as a consensual system based on the will of states, it was the shortest of logical steps to conclude that international law can only be understood as a product of history. Only a study of the actual experiences of states can reveal what agreements states have actually concluded at any given time. Here too, the affinity between the positivists and the historical school of law is clear. Furthermore, it became apparent, when such a close study was duly carried out, that one particular group of states had been responsible for agreeing on the corpus of rules known as international law. These were the countries of Western Europe, together with their overseas offshoots in the Western Hemisphere. 

The result of this way of thinking was an apparent paradox. Natural lawyers were, by temperament, social critics, ever striving to bring power to heel under the rule of law.105 At the same time, though, the law to which they were so devoted was static. It was an unchanging corpus of substantive rules—applicable, to be sure, in widely varying circumstances, but fundamentally unvarying. The nineteenth-century positivists were just the opposite. They were conservatives in the sense that they left governments with a largely free hand to operate as they wished, without any carping or nagging. They were nonjudgmental—perhaps to a fault. But their vision of law and lawmaking was intrinsically dynamic. Constant change was its very essence. In this very particular sense, the positivist lawyers could be called “progressives.” There were those who doubted, though, whether constant change, unleavened by even a scintilla of bracing criticism, was necessarily a good thing. Was it not possible that some kinds of change might be bad rather than good? For the overwhelming part, the positivist lawyers displayed little inclination to ask questions such as this. They saw great progress all around them and were conscious that they were playing a part in it, if only at the humble ministerial level rather than as policy makers.

truly, the “body politic.” Consequently, there is an urgent need to remove the myriad governmental distortions and interferences that prevent the natural mechanism from working smoothly. Highest on the physiocratic target list were the various programs under the general label of mercantilism—the elaborate network of monopolies, subsidies, taxes, quotas, employment restrictions, and sumptuary laws—that had the effect of diverting the natural flows and rhythms of the economy into artificial channels. “Laissez faire, laissez passer,” a phrase coined by A. R. J. Turgot in 1757, became their most famous motto. (Like all good propagandists, the physiocrats were very prolific in the production of mottoes.) This clarion call applied most directly to the dismantling of barriers to the free flow of grain between the provinces of France, with the immediate purpose of allowing supplies to flow freely from places of surplus to places of shortage so as to avert famines. It was primarily British political economists who took up the physiocratic ideas and applied them more widely. 

On this point, too, Bastiat was characteristically outspoken. “Our code is this,” he declared: “ ‘The least possible contact between governments, the most contact between peoples.’ Why? Because contact between governments compromises peace, whereas contact between peoples guarantees it.”47 With trade so highly praised as the key to world peace, it is perhaps not surprising to find Richard Cobden, one of the most dedicated British economic liberals of the century, grandly proclaiming that

Its written in legalese and discussed on CSpan instead of major channels. Plus at the time more people were focused on an impending government shut down. Its amazing what kind of egregious laws are passed with out people noticing. In my home state the voting laws were just changed so out of state students attending college would have to re register their drivers license and change license plates if they wanted to register to vote here and virtually no one noticed because people don't follow politics that closely or realize how much of an impact they can have.


One that works and benefits the people who must abide by that law.Assuming that by &quot;good&quot; we mean acceptable in the democratic concept, a &quot;good&quot; law is one which is:1) Clear2) Possible to follow3) Enforceable4) Consistent with the country's constitutional rightOthers would add that the law should also have a &quot;worthwhile purpose&quot; (although worthwhile seems open to value judgments) and which should also be &quot;fair&quot; (but we could also say that laws should be enforced equally or applied equally to all citizens)

If the majority of the population disagrees with the law and does not obey or contribute to its enforcement (say some drug laws) it is a bad law.
Good laws respect the right of individuals to self determination and choice. Laws which represent &quot;tyranny of the majority&quot; are also not good laws.
Every time you pass a law you create &quot;criminals&quot; so the fewest laws compatible with a functioning society is desirable.

You might have noticed that law has grown progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two. If you run a business, it's hard to do much of anything without calling your general counsel. Indeed, there is this phenomenon now where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs. It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. You need a lawyer to run the company, because there's so much law. But it's not just business that's affected by this, it's actually pressed down into the daily activities of ordinary people. 

Now for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm that lawsuits are out of control. And we read every once in while about these crazy lawsuits, like the guy in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars because they lost his pair of pants. The case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case. 

They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac. That's the only explanation. Because why would you have to tell people that something was actually hot? My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure. I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing. Five-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure, with a three pronged hook in the back, and outside it said, &quot;Harmful if swallowed.&quot; (Laughter)

Law sets boundaries, and on one side of those boundaries are all the things you can't do or must do -- you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes -- but those same boundaries are supposed to define and protect a dry ground of freedom.
13:18 Isaiah Berlin put it this way: &quot;Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn, within which men shall be inviolable.&quot; We've forgotten that second part. Those dikes have burst. People wade through law all day long. So, what's needed now is to rebuild these boundaries. And it's especially important to rebuild them for lawsuits. Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries for everybody else's freedom. If someone brings a lawsuit over, &quot;A kid fell off the seesaw,&quot; it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit, all the seesaws will disappear. Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit. And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms, merry-go-rounds, climbing ropes, nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four, because there's no risk associated with it.
14:06


And so here is the fourth proposition. This is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to. And there are two essential elements of it: We have to simplify the law. We have to migrate from all this complexity towards general principles and goals. The constitution is only 16 pages long. Worked pretty well for 200 years.

An affected Partner State may, following such consultation, exercise criminal jurisdiction over the alleged perpetrator provided that, within 90 days of the date of such consultation or within such other period as may be mutually agreed, the Partner State whose national is the alleged perpetrator either:
(1) concurs in such exercise of criminal jurisdiction, or
(2) fails to provide assurances that it will submit the case to its competent authorities for the purpose of prosecution.

The Manufacturers Aircraft Association Inc. (MAA) was created in 1917 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to administer a cross-license agreement, issue licenses to aircraft companies, aid the aircraft industry, and encourage aeronautical development. The subscribers were airplane manufacturers who were stockholders and paid fees for every plane that they manufactured. The association protected its members' patent rights. From the day of its incorporation the motives of the manufacturers and the government were publically attacked by the press and Congress. The association was investigated numerous times by congressional committees throughout its history. In 1965 the government filed an anti-trust suit against the association. After a lengthy legal battle, the M.A.A. was dissolved in 1977.
The Association came into being when the United States government realized the utility of aircraft in military operations in 1916. Therefore inventions, patents, and design rights applicable to aircraft became a national interest. Because aeronautical development in the United Stated was seriously retarded by litigation over the validity and value of important airplane patents, the government thought that natural expansion and normal growth of the industry seemed impossible. In 1917 the Hon. Franklin D. Roosevelt, then Acting Secretary of the Navy, and Hon. W.M. Ingraham, then Acting Secretary of War, requested the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to study this problem (the N.A.C.A. was created by congress in 1915 to advise the president and the executive departments on aeronautical questions).
The N.A.C.A.'s plan was to create an organization independent of the government. The Manufacturers Aircraft Association was formed to administer a cross-license agreement, issue licenses, aid the aircraft industry, and encourage aeronautical development. The M.A.A. was incorporated in the State of New York in 1917. The subscribers of the association were airplane manufacturers. They were stockholders and paid fees to the association for every airplane that they manufactured. In return the association protected their patent rights. It had a patent research division, extensive files on patent history, and published informational bulletins and reports for the subscribers.

A trial was held in 2008, concluding in May, to calculate damages. Judge Allegra found that the total royalties due to Boeing should be $16.9 million.

According to the judge's ruling, Boeing began experimenting with ways to reduce the weight of its airplanes in the 1970s and '80s, a move spurred by high jet fuel prices. The company's experiments focused on aluminum-lithium alloys, which had previously been shunned by the industry because they were thought to fracture easily.

Boeing eventually developed a composition that could be heat-treated with a process called low-temperature underaging to create an alloy suitable for airplane manufacturing, the opinion said. The company patented the underaging process in 1989 and licensed the patent to three aluminum manufacturers.

Around the same time, NASA began working on ways to reduce the weight of the space shuttle's external tank, in part because of weight restrictions related to construction of the International Space Station, according to the opinion.

The space agency contracted with Lockheed Martin Space Systems Co. to design a new external tank, the ruling said. In 1994, a team of NASA and Lockheed employees began using low-temperature underaging to strengthen the alloy used in the tank. The new super-lightweight tank first flew in a shuttle mission in 1998 and is still used today.

In 1998, Boeing came to believe that Lockheed was using its patented technique to develop the new tank and offered to license the patent to Lockheed, according to the opinion. Lockheed did not acknowledge the offer and told Boeing to take up any allegations of infringement with NASA.

According to the ruling, Boeing then sued the space agency in 2000.

NASA unsuccessfully argued that the alloy used in the shuttle had a different chemical composition and used a different type of heat treatment than alloys made according to Boeing's patent, the ruling said.

The patent-in-suit is U.S. Patent Number 4,840,682, issued in 1989 and titled &quot;Low temperature underaging process for lithium bearing alloys.&quot;

America’s largest tech corporations are using a business technique called “efficient infringement,” meaning they calculate benefits of stealing patented technology against possibility of getting caught, tried in court, and paying damages and penalties. If benefits exceed costs, they target and steal. Two aspects making patent theft extremely attractive are: 1) infringement is not a criminal act, and 2) those found guilty face no jail time. Being fined is the worst fate of the perpetrator, small change for defense contractors.
 
The most aggressive users of this patent theft business model are fifteen of America’s largest tech corporations, at least one on the missing MH370. Leading them all is Cisco, the biggest competitor of ZTE and Huawei, two Chinese defense contractors represented on board the Malaysian Airlines missing Boeing 777. Following Cisco are Intel, IBM – that had a CEO on board MH370, Microsoft and HP. For years, these multinationals have spent millions of dollars lobbying Congress to buy legislation that would weaken existing U.S. patent infringement laws


Market power can be exercised in other economic dimensions, such as quality, service, and the development of new or improved goods and processes. It is assumed in this definition that all
competitive dimensions are held constant except the ones in which market power is being exercised;
that a seller is able to charge higher prices for a higher-quality product does not alone indicate market
power. The definition in the text is stated in terms of a seller with market power. A buyer could also
exercise market power (e.g., by maintaining the price below the competitive level, thereby depressing
output). The Agencies note that the law is unclear on this issue.
Market power is the ability profitably to maintain prices above, or output below, competitive levels for a significant period of time. The Agencies will not presume that a patent, copyright, or trade secret necessarily confers market power upon its owner. Although the intellectual property right confers the power to exclude with respect to the specific product, process, or work in question, there will often be sufficient actual or potential close substitutes for such product, process, or work to prevent the exercise of market power. If a patent or other form of intellectual property does confer market power, that market power does not by itself offend the antitrust laws. As with any other tangible or intangible asset that enables its owner to obtain significant supracompetitive profits, market power (or even a
monopoly) that is solely “a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic
accident” does not violate the antitrust laws. Nor does such market power impose on the
intellectual property owner an obligation to license the use of that property to others. As in
other antitrust contexts, however, market power could be illegally acquired or maintained,
or, even if lawfully acquired and maintained, would be relevant to the ability of an
intellectual property owner to harm competition through unreasonable conduct in connection
with such property.

How can human beings rule over other human beings? God has dominion over human beings. Human beings have been made in the image of god. God hands that dominion over to human beings, dominion In Se, dominion over our own liberty. Using that dominion we create institutions. In particular two types of institutions. Dominion propietatis. Dominion euprincipitatiotes. Property is the other form of dominion. Property relations are not between humans and things, but between humans. Human relations of jurisdiction and dominion. They are not natural law.

Muslims now call for Sharia, muslims in the time following Mohammeds death attempted to divine sharia from the texts of the Koran. The laws were founded in divine authority. I.e. introduction of tax systems that were backlisted to mohammed to give them religious legitimacy. 
Traditional islamic law has very little to say about criminal law. Its about inheritcane law, its about property law. Its enforce by appeal to the Qadi, enforcement by local judges. The law was created by academics, not judges. the law is not made by god. the work jurisprudence is a human endeavor, they are trying to uncover what god has said, what does obedience look like. This is why the Hadith, why Shafi becomes important. People were using the word Sunna, and were wondering what this meant.   - -Similar to constitutional originalists - “judges deciding constitutional issues should confine themselves to enforcing norms that are stated or clearly implicit in the written constitution- the court should find a right to exist in the Constitution only if it is expressly stated in the text or was clearly intended by its framers. “discovered within the four corners of the document.” Meaning of a constitutional provision was set when it was adopted, and that it can be changed solely by amendment. For example - liberty and abortion.

A Constitution is unique because it is difficult to change. Great britain, for example, has no written constitution. Whereas legislative enactments can be modified by another statue, the Constitution can be amended only by a much more elaborate and difficult procedure. Why should a society generally committed to majority rule choose to be governed by a document that is very difficult to change? Laurence Tribe puts it: “Why would a nation that rests legality on the consent of the governed choose to constitute its political life in terms of commitments to an original agreememnt - made by the people, binding on their children, and deliberately structured so as to be difficult to change?” Hardly original to say “to prevent tyranny of the majority”. If the structure of government was placed in a statue, there might be an overwhelming tendency to create dictatorial powers in times of crisis. If protections of individual liberteis were placed in statues only, a tyrannical government could overrule them. If terms of office were specified in a statue rather than in the constitution, those in power could alter the rules to remain in power. 

Islamic law is the result of academic investigation instead of judicial ruling. What is most important is what god’s prophet on earth acutally said, and what traditions were legitimate, rather than deciding on the basis of equity.

Sell the idea that hitler had no real personal opinion on the jews. It was all manipulation of the german people.

Each man had to struggle between the instincts of self-preservation and the admonitions of duty. I, too, was not spared by this struggle. Always when Death was on the hunt, a vague something inside tried to revolt. It strove to present itself to the weak body as reason, yet it was only cowardice, which in such disguises tries to ensnare the individual. A grave tugging and warning set in, and often it was only the last remnant of conscience which decided the issue. Yet the more this voice admonished one to caution, the louder and more insistent its lures, the sharper resistance grew until at last, after a long inner struggle, consciousness of duty emerged victorious. By the end of the events in the Beta Sector this struggle had for me been decided. At last my will was undisputed master. If in the first days I went over the top with rejoicing and laughter, I was now calm and determined. And this was enduring. Now Fate could bring on the ultimate tests without my nerve shattering or my reason failing.  

For these people change their convictions just as the soldier changes his shirt in war – when the old one is bug-eaten. In the new programme everyone gets everything he wants. The farmer is assured that the interests of agriculture will be safeguarded. The industrialist is assured of protection for his products. The consumer is assured that his interests will be protected in the market prices. Teachers are given higher salaries and civil servants will have better pensions. Widows and orphans will receive generous assistance from the State. Trade will be promoted. The tariff will be lowered and even the taxes, though they cannot be entirely abolished, will be almost abolished. It sometimes happens that one section of the public is forgotten or that one of the demands mooted among the public has not reached the ears of the party. This is also hurriedly patched on to the whole, should there be any space available for it: until finally it is felt that there are good grounds for hoping that the whole normal host of philistines, including their wives, will have their anxieties laid to rest and will beam with satisfaction once again. And so, internally armed with faith in the goodness of God and the impenetrable stupidity of the electorate, the struggle for what is called 'the reconstruction' can now begin.

When four years have passed, or in the meantime if there should be some critical weeks during which the parliamentary corporations have to face the danger of being dissolved, these honourable gentlemen become suddenly seized by an irresistible desire to act. Just as the grub-worm cannot help growing into a cock-chafer, these parliamentarian worms leave the great House of Puppets and flutter on new wings out among the beloved public. They address the electors once again, give an account of the enormous labours they have accomplished and emphasize the malicious obstinacy of their opponents. They do not always meet with grateful applause; for occasionally the unintelligent masses throw rude and unfriendly remarks in their faces. When this spirit of public ingratitude reaches a certain pitch there is only one way of saving the situation. The prestige of the party must be burnished up again. The programme has to be amended. The committee is called into existence once again. And the swindle begins anew. Once we understand the impenetrable stupidity of our public we cannot be surprised that such tactics turn out successful. Led by the Press and blinded once again by the alluring appearance of the new programme, the bourgeois as well as the proletarian herds of voters faithfully return to the common stall and re-elect their old deceivers. The 'people's man' and labour candidate now change back again into the parliamentarian grub and become fat and rotund as they batten on the leaves that grow on the tree of public life – to be retransformed into the glittering butterfly after another four years have passed.

Rewrite as Beksinski

As I have said, only a very credulous soul could think of binding himself to observe the rules of the game when he has to face a player for whom those rules are nothing but a mere bluff or a means of serving his own interests, which means he will discard them when they prove no longer useful for his purpose.
An essential characteristic of what are called the great questions of the time is that thousands undertake the task of solving them and that many feel themselves called to this task: yea, even that Destiny itself has proposed many for the choice, so that through the free play of forces the stronger and bolder shall finally be victorious and to him shall be entrusted the task of solving the problem.
Thus it may happen that for centuries many are discontented with the form in which their religious life expresses itself and yearn for a renovation of it; and so it may happen that through this impulse of the soul some dozens of men may arise who believe that, by virtue of their understanding and their knowledge, they are called to solve the religious difficulties of the time and accordingly present themselves as the prophets of a new teaching or at least as declared adversaries of the standing beliefs.
Here also it is certain that the natural law will take its course, inasmuch as the strongest will be destined to fulfil the great mission. But usually the others are slow to acknowledge that only one man is called. On the contrary, they all believe that they have an equal right to engage in the solution of the difficulties in question and that they are equally called to that task. Their contemporary world is generally quite unable to decide which of all these possesses the highest gifts and accordingly merits the support of all.
So in the course of centuries, or indeed often within the same epoch, different men establish different movements to struggle towards the same end. At least the end is declared by the founders of the movements to be the same, or may be looked upon as such by the masses of the people. The populace nourishes vague desires and has only general opinions, without having any precise notion of their own ideals and desires or of the question whether and how it is impossible for these ideals and desires to be fulfilled.
The tragedy lies in the fact that many men struggle to reach the same objective by different roads, each one genuinely believing in his own mission and holding himself in duty bound to follow his own road without any regard for the others.
These movements, parties, religious groups, etc., originate entirely independently of one another out of the general urge of the time, and all with a view to working towards the same goal. It may seem a tragic thing, at least at first sight, that this should be so, because people are too often inclined to think that forces which are dispersed in different directions would attain their ends far more quickly and more surely if they were united in one common effort. But that is not so. For Nature herself decides according to the rules of her inexorable logic. She leaves these diverse groups to compete with one another and dispute the palm of victory and thus she chooses the clearest, shortest and surest way along which she leads the movement to its final goal.
How could one decide from outside which is the best way, if the forces at hand were not allowed free play, if the final decision were to rest with the doctrinaire judgment of men who are so infatuated with their own superior knowledge that their minds are not open to accept the indisputable proof presented by manifest success, which in the last analysis always gives the final confirmation of the justice of a course of action.
Hence, though diverse groups march along different routes towards the same objective, as soon as they come to know that analogous efforts are being made around them, they will have to study all the more carefully whether they have chosen the best way and whether a shorter way may not be found and how their efforts can best be employed to reach the objective more quickly.
Through this rivalry each individual protagonist develops his faculties to a still higher pitch of perfection and the human race has frequently owed its progress to the lessons learned from the misfortunes of former attempts which have come to grief. Therefore we may conclude that we come to know the better ways of reaching final results through a state of things which at first sight appeared tragic; namely, the initial dispersion of individual efforts, wherein each group was unconsciously responsible for such dispersion.
In studying the lessons of history with a view to finding a way for the solution of the German problem, the prevailing opinion at one time was that there were two possible paths along which that problem might be solved and that these two paths should have united from the very beginning. The chief representatives and champions of these two paths were Austria and Prussia respectively, Habsburg and Hohenzollern. All the rest, according to this prevalent opinion, ought to have entrusted their united forces to the one or the other party. But at that time the path of the most prominent representative, the Habsburg, would have been taken, though the Austrian policy would never have led to the foundation of a united German Reich.
Thus the foundation of the German Reich was not the consequence of any common will working along common lines, but it was much more the outcome of a deliberate struggle for hegemony, though the protagonists were often hardly conscious of this. And from this struggle Prussia finally came out victorious. Anybody who is not so blinded by partisan politics as to deny this truth will have to agree that the so-called wisdom of men would never have come to the same wise decision as the wisdom of Life itself, that is to say, the free play of forces, finally brought to realization. For in the German lands of two hundred years before who would seriously have believed that Hohenzollern Prussia, and not Habsburg, would become the germ cell, the founder and the tutor of the new Reich? And, on the other hand, who would deny today that Destiny thus acted wiser than human wisdom. Who could now imagine a German Reich based on the foundations of an effete and degenerate dynasty?
No. The general evolution of things, even though it took a century of struggle, placed the best in the position that it had merited.
And that will always be so. Therefore it is not to be regretted if different men set out to attain the same objective. In this way the strongest and swiftest becomes recognized and turns out to be the victor.

S_ECONOMICS


	Axiom - we build systems that we can’t understand, so we can’t predict all possible causes of failure. That is inherent in the business of building complicated systems. Does that mean we shouldn’t ever build anything of things will always be really risky. the answer is no, There is something you can do. Even though we can’t say all the ways in which it might fail, we can say all the things that must occur to succeed. What that means is that you can actually design a system to detect deviations of all the things that need to succeed. So to succeed, you need to stay within the bounds of certain state variables. You can separate yourself from the worry of all the ways it might fail, to focus on all the things that need to go right for it to succeed. Then you can always detect against that finite set of things that must succeed. - To respond to failure, it takes time. Since response takes time, if the response takes a long period of time, even though you can detect it, you still may not be able to do anything about it - so you have to be able to detect it early enough. So launch abort systems, you need to be able to detect whether or not the ship is exploding, or if the you are losing control so that you will not be able to abort in the future. Of course these are time dependent, because the signal may be sent too late.
	redundancy management - if I have a failure in one of these systems, I have another that can take over. That will only work if that take over and continue happen faster than the failures. - this is a fundamental axiom of control theory. If you are going to detect and respond to a failure, that detection and response had better be faster than the thing you are responding to.
		If you do an investigation, and no one is at fault, you can still fail.
triplex computing - 1:44
	prognostication - failure prediction
failure masking - three identical computers performing the exact same calculations, so the goal is to make sure you have correct computation from the set of three computers, so you could have a voting scheme. The voter says, if any one of the computers gives me a value that is differnt than the other two - so after the voting, you can be assured that you are getting the correct value, even if one of the computers is outputting an incorrect value. Even though the failure is internal, you never see it at the interface level.

temporal redundancy - git/p4
information redundancy - error detection and correction codes - put in extra bits into signal, when you recieve signal, firmware uses the extra bits to detect if there is a bit flip in a certain set of data, so there is enough information there to reconstruct the correct signal.
knowledge redundancy - how does one detect that oneself is getting dementia? You can not be an adequate judge of your own behavior. If your mind is going bad, you can’t use your mind to determine that. To determine if something is wrong, you can’t use the object itself to determine that. Using knowledge separate from the system itself to help make decisions.

Any engineered system has a goal. You can always talk about its purpose. For any engineered system, what ultimately matters is whether it achieves its purpose, or whether it does not. So the first step is to ask, what does it mean to suceed, then put boundaries around those behaviors, and anything that falls inside is acceptable, outside is not.

redundancy plays a central role in fault management.

We have an education bubble. Bubbles are characterized by things costing more than they are worth. They are characterized by intense psycho-social dynamics. Its very hard for people to suggest that you shouldn’t go to the best college you can get into, becaause people don’t know what else to do. Bubbles are characterized by abstracts from reality. Education is an abstract filler. What is it specifically you are learning? You are investing by consuming. Education is an insurance policy - its not worth as much as people are paying for it, but they are scared of falling through the cracks in our society, so they pay more and more for it. In reality, its the opposite of an insurance policy. Its a kind of zero sum tournament where what really matters is getting into the best schools. And then a diploma from a third tier university is really a dunce hat in disguise. Its a zero sum tournament masquerading as a higher education. The homogenization of higher education prevents individuals from asking of themselves, “What are you really good at, that other people aren’t so good at.” 

Complex internal politics [in large companies] makes it incredibly possible for smaller companies to not get squashed by larger companies.

All unhappy companies are alike in that they have failed to escape the essential sameness that is competition.

Capitalism and competition are antonyms.
Very capitalist companies that have no real competition do very well and innovate, but industries that are flooded with competition are valueless.

People who have monopolies pretend not to have them. People who don’t have them tend to have them.

There are two kinds of companies - those who are in competition and no one makes any money, and those who are monopolies and do very well.

Why are they fighting so intensely because the stakes are small?
If the stakes are small, it becomes difficult to differentaite yourself, and it becomes difficult, and you fight even harder.

Earth has begun to turn towards the resources that space has to offer. There are many initiatives, both public and private, to exploit these resources. The majority of which, offers itself in the lucrative asteroid mining business. Among these are gold, cobalt, iron, manganese, molybdenum, nickel, osmium, palladium, platinum, rhenium, rhodium, ruthenium, and tungsten. Near earth asteriods have been picked over. A class of easily recoverable objects (EROs) was identified by a group of researchers in 2013. Twelve asteroids made up the initially identified group, all of which could be potentially mined with present-day rocket technology. Of 9000 asteroids searched in the NEO database, these twelve could all be brought into an Earth-accessible orbit by changing their velocity by less than 500 meters per second (1,800 km/h; 1,100 mph). The dozen asteroids range in size from 2 to 20 meters (10 to 70 ft)

In 1997 it was speculated that a relatively small metallic asteroid with a diameter of 1.6 km (0.99 mi) contains more than $20 trillion USD worth of industrial and precious metals.[6][47] A comparatively small M-type asteroid with a mean diameter of 1 kilometer (0.62 mi) could contain more than two billion metric tons of iron–nickel ore,[48] or two to three times the annual production of 2004.[49] The asteroid 16 Psyche is believed to contain 1.7×1019 kg of nickel–iron, which could supply the world production requirement for several million years. A small portion of the extracted material would also be precious metals.
Although Planetary Resources says that platinum from a 30-meter long asteroid is worth 25–50 billion USD,[50] an economist remarked that any outside source of precious metals could lower prices sufficiently to possibly doom the venture by rapidly increasing the available supply of such metals.[51]
Development of an asteroid-orbit manipulation infrastructure could offer an irresistible return on investment.[52] However, astrophysicists Carl Sagan and Steven J. Ostro raised the concern that altering the trajectories of asteroids in nearby interplanetary space could cause a catastrophic collision with Earth. These scientists conclude that stringent controls on the misuse of orbit-engineering technology be instituted.[52][53][54]

	Early in the life of the solar system, dust and rock circling the sun were pulled together by gravity into planets. But Jupiter, the largest planet, kept a number of the pieces from coalescing into another planet. Instead, its gravity disrupted the formation process, leaving an array of unattached asteroids.
	The Main Belt once contained enough material to form a planet nearly four times as large as Earth. Jupiter's gravity not only stopped the creation of such a planet, it also swept most of the material clear, leaving far too little behind for a planet of any size to form. Indeed, if the entire mass of the Main Belt could somehow create a single body, it would weigh in at less than half of the mass of the moon.

At 590 miles (950 km) in diameter, or about a quarter of the size of our moon, Ceres is round yet is considered too small to be a full-fledged planet. However, it makes up approximately a third of the mass of the asteroid belt.

Privatized U.S. corporations have launched and funded space programs geared towards the wrangling of mineral rich asteroids into near earth orbit. Among these are AAMC - American Asteroid Mining Corporation, and GLI - Gold Leaf Industries. These coroporations dominate the space sector, and do so for multiple reasons.
AAMC was created in wake of patent litigation against John Knowles and co., an engineering group that patented an engine that allowed for travel up to ___, allowing trips to the asteroid belt and back in 30 days, in an extremely cost efficient manner. The American government’s anti-trust challenge was settled out-of-court. In return for the government's agreement not to pursue its case against Knowles Co. as a monopolist, Knowles agreed to divest the controlling interest it had acquired in smaller space industry companies, and to allow non-competing independent tech companies to utilize. Knowles co. became a government sanctioned monopoly and was rebranded AAMC. 


Litigation may also make smart-phones dearer. Mr White of Bristol York estimates that device makers already have to pay royalties for 200-300 patents for a typical smart-phone. Patent costs are 15-20% of its selling price, or about half of what the hardware components cost. “If 50 people [each] want 2% of a device's value, we have a problem,” says Josh Lerner, a professor at Harvard Business School.  ---- You can attack them by going after earth assets. --- Competitiveness via export/import bank. - See Aerospace Industries Association

AIA is lobbying congress to get bill that allows private resource gathering of M-type asteroids. This has national security interests because it would functionally corner the market on such metals a’la DeBeers monopoly on diamonds. Introduce artificial scarcity/market fixing, etc. Necessary to do it before Eastern nations do. Private American corporations want splitting market off the table because it would have a destabilizing effect on the economy - in order for it to work it would require a magnitude of trust across nation states never seen.

“The Experiment” is one such covert operation. A brain trust including engineers from AIA have banded together and produced an interesting result. This is what Beksinski destroys in the prologue. 

	First they have to invalidate Beksinski’s patent on the engine. Beksinski owns “Trade Secret” on engine, companies in AIA owns patents on manufacturing processes, but have failed thus far to re-engineer beksinski’s device. Beksinski’s trip has generated a kind of space race and focus on law reform. 




Stability means rigidity. Communism would introduce a whole new measure of existential crisis to the modern man. Our current mode of capitalism has abandoned the level of creative destruction that allowed humans to be human. Our corporations have existed for centuries, and there is no identity except through them. They own the capital, the patents, the foundation of our society.
Capitalism - trickle down conflict.

He at first tries to use the machine to his advantage, to fufill his dream of the dissolution of the nation state model.  focuses on his efforts and its effect on a few individuals on earth. However, as the story progresses, Beksinski becomes more and more convinced he has created ‘god’;  he believes that this is the highest form of intelligence attainable, and that it is responsible for creating universes, and that, somehow, this intelligence has become a prophet through which the intelligence of our universe can commune.
	Intro Conflict: Beksinski attempts to instigate global conflict by exploiting the weaknesses in the nation state model. The focus is on intellectual property, monopolies, international law, space law, and the patent system.
	Climax: 
	Cliffhanger: Moto discoveries strange weapons on Anatolia.

Book 2 focuses on the discovery of alien weaponry pointed towards earth on Anatolia, which is to be revealed at the end of book one. This discovery completely upsets Beksinski’s plan and the development of NWO on earth. Patent voided, treaties enacted that effectively cement nation state sovereignty as nations join together to create Fleet to deal with this external threat. Beksinski becomes ostracized as his dealings with the aliens and the destruction of the Expirement comes to light. Tensions with aliens flare in conflict over resources. Intelligence community plays critical role in analyzing capabilities of aliens and in creation of plans for debilitating first strike on alien industry.

Book 3 focuses on war and its rejection of structure. In the past, war was chaos because people died. When individual agents in the structure die, the system changes.

Jakub Beksinski - He was given technology by alien observers that would allow for efficient and speedy travel over long distances. They did so, because they estimated that humans were about to discover the technology within the century, and they wanted to make sure that the right person got it first. They did this because they were concerned that our society was still governed by the nation-state model. The few other societies that had developed such technology had a common law that applied to its own people, and as such they were not engaged in the creative destruction of the capitalist model. They viewed this model as only necessary if nations were at-odds with eachother. At what point can we slow down and gain stability for all citizens? The nation state body sanctifies and justifies inequality amongst civilians of the same planet. (e.g. rich american, vs. poor african). They worry about the effect this will have on space-faring communities. Bringing the beast to their egalitarian societies.

They, along with 2 other species have been appropriated resources in space sans-conflict, due to the structure of their societies.

Great differences exist between Louisianan civil law and common law found in all other American states. While many differences have been bridged due to the strong influence of common law, the &quot;civilian&quot; tradition is still deeply rooted in Louisiana private law and in some parts of criminal law.
One often-cited distinction is that while common law courts are bound by stare decisis and tend to rule based on precedents, judges in Louisiana rule based on their own interpretation of the law.[15] This distinction is not absolute, though. Civil law has its own respect for established precedent, the doctrine of jurisprudence constante. But the Louisiana Supreme Court notes the principal difference between the two legal doctrines: a single court decision can provide sufficient foundation for stare decisis, however, &quot;a series of adjudicated cases, all in accord, form the basis for jurisprudence constante.&quot; [16] Moreover, Louisiana Courts of Appeals have explicitly noted that jurisprudence constante is merely a secondary source of law, which cannot be authoritative and does not rise to the level of stare decisis. [17]
Property, contractual, business entities structure, much of civil procedure, and family law are still strongly influenced by traditional Roman legal thinking. Louisiana law retains terms and concepts unique in American law: usufruct, forced heirship, redhibition, and lesion beyond moiety are a few examples.
Due to the civil law tradition, Louisiana's constitution does not contain a right to a trial by jury in civil cases, although this right is contained in the Louisiana Revised Statutes. Additionally, appellate courts have a much broader discretion to review findings of fact by juries in civil cases.[18] Also, damages are apportioned differently from in common law jurisdictions; specific performance is almost always available, and juries may hear cases that would be considered equitable in other jurisdictions.
In commercial law, the 49 other states have completely adopted the Uniform Commercial Code standardizing the rules of commercial transactions. Louisiana enacted most provisions of the UCC, except for Article 2, which is inconsistent with civil law traditions governing the sale of goods. However, several articles regarding the incorporation of terms into a contract have been adopted into the Civil Code. Louisiana also refers to the major subdivisions of the UCC as “chapters” instead of articles, since the term “articles” is used in that state to refer to provisions of the Louisiana Civil Code.
Legal careers are also molded by the differences. Legal education, the bar exam, and standards of legal practice in Louisiana are significantly different from other states. For example, the Louisiana Bar Exam is the longest of any state, at 21.5 hours. The Multistate Bar Examination is not administered in Louisiana.

The kinds of changes that the Aurignacian people were experiencing in France were typical of the unstable world of northern Eurasia during this time. An excellent and dramatic example of these changes is provided by the pollen record from the Lago Grande di Monticchio in southern Italy. The pollen record spans the past 100 thousand years and so includes the period between 50 and 30 thousand years ago. The site records constant and rapid shifts in the landscape around the lake, from steppe through wooded steppe to forest and back. It is precisely these kinds of changes that were happening across many areas and to which the people of Eurasia had constantly to adapt and re-adapt. The most striking insight provided by Monticchio is the speed of change as the major vegetation changes were taking 142 years on average. This means that one generation of humans might have been living in a forested landscape, their children in wooded steppe, and their grandchildren in open steppe.
       	The kind of brusque ecological ghanges that we saw in Monticchio were not unique. They typified the contact zone at this time of huge climatic and environmental turnover. The Siberian Arctic was, paradoxically, stable though cold but humans only managed incursions here after 36 thousand years ago. But the animals of the far north did come south and west as their habitat expanded and they came into contact with humans on the fringe areas of southern Siberia and west all the way to France. This edge between woodland and treeless habitats waxed and waned many times along a narrow belt between plains and mountains. This was the tension zone, in places like the Altai, the Carpathians, and they Pyrenees, wehre humans were being stretched to the limits of their ingenuity and it is right across here that we see cultures and technologies that we define as transitional or early Upper Palaolithic. This was the novelty sector were over and over again, for fifteen millennia, survival battles were won and lost.

The decade that started in 1998 saw a heated debate between scholars in pursuit of an idea. As it turns out it was a sterile debate without hope of being resolved satisfactorily, for the simple reason that both sides failed to recognize the limitations of the evidence at their disposal.

By the time the classic Neanderthals had emerged, during the last interglacial around 125 thousand years ago, they were already a people doomed to extinction. Like the hippos, rhinos, and elephants of the Eurasian forest, the Neanderthals were a population of lifing dead, existing on borrowed time. Like these other mammals, the Neanderthals had a short-lived moment of reprieve as the climate warmed up. The next time the climate would be this generous, 100 thousand years lateer, Neaderthals, straight-tusked elephants, and narrow-nosed rhinos would no longer be. Only their fossils would remain, buried and waiting to be discovered by another human who would ponder the nature of his own existence and presumptuously imagine his involvement in the debacle of his distant cousin, the Neanderthal.


It's probably best not to think of space as a physical object, although to an extent that's more of a philosophical question, I guess. I find that it's usually not helpful to think of space as something physical - something that can be sliced, bent, twisted, and broken like soft cheese - because it often leads people to jump to incorrect conclusions about the nature of the universe. Space is not &quot;sucked into a black hole&quot;, for instance.
When we talk about space expanding or warping, you can think of it as us changing the rules of geometry, rather than us actually bending a physical thing. When space expands, it's the same as saying that the distance between objects is increasing. When gravity &quot;bends space&quot;, we're saying that that there's a sort of &quot;space-time distance&quot;, and that this &quot;distance&quot; between points changes when there's gravity. Or, we're saying that a &quot;straight line in space-time&quot; is something that is affected by gravity.
Thinking of space as a physical object may be a useful analogy, but it may really be best to think of &quot;bending of space-time&quot; etc as geometry just following different rules that you're used to: that angles, distances, and straight-lines do not follow the classical rules.

Heating gas hydrogen and deuterium gas. If you think of the diff states of matter, you heat from solid/liquid/gas, if you heat further, you reach another state of matter - plasma. that is reached as soon as the atoms are split into their electrons and their ions. You separate atoms into pos and neg. particles. The cores lose the shell that is compoosed of electrons. It makes the whole atom neutral. ONce they leave the ion, the whole ion conglomerate. Its like an electron soup where they all float around.  So what are the physicla properties. Its not a gas. Its more accurate as a two fluid model. The charges of the two atoms are now visible. If you have electromagnetic forces, you see the plasma react to tehse fields. A neutral gas doesn’t react to this, a plasma does. You can split negative electrons and positive cores by putting a neg. electromagnetic field around it. THere is a mag. field. particles will actually separate. From that separation, there arises an electric field. There are also acts on itself. There is self effect of the plasma, and that leads to all sorts of new physcis. 

The challenge for fusion reacion power plant, you have to manage the plasma. it is extremely hot, so you can’t let the plasma touch the bucket its in. The temp is above 10 mill degeress, which is hotter than any material, so we need to control it in a way that it doesn’t touch any surroundings. So we generate mag fields to use Lorentz force to manage the particles, and the plasma as a whole. So first there is magnetic confinement. There is a mag field, and the particles are confined in the field lines. So they make a torus mag field. particles are confined in that regard. At this point, there is separation of particles, the ions will drift to the upper, the electrons to the lower, so the

The best theoretical explanation for understanding why neutrinos travel faster than light is the following theory: When Neutrinos are produced at CERN in Switzerland, they travel at the speed of light, but, as soon as they pass the border from Switzerland to Italy, they do not respect laws any more, and they travel much faster than light.

S_HISTORY

/u/TheGreenReaper7
Your second question (serfs answer to lords who answer to kings) is rather easily disproved off-hand by examining Occitania where land could be held in allod (ie. 'of' no one). While the Occitan aristocracy might owe 'feudal' obligations for certain territories and titles they also held lands entirely in their own right not owing services to any king for them. On the issue of serfs and peasants, if the model was as neatly cut as you wish to believe then how could a king demand the homage and fidelity of his entire populace as John of England did in 1209? Surely he would only need the homage of his aristocracy and could rely on the rest through the feudal pyramid. There were also royal dominions (demesne - although like 'fealty' that term is anachronistic; dominion and oaths of fidelity are less loaded and useful) in which peasants answered directly to the king. In no small part 'feudalism' is being discarded because it enables these kind of oversimplifications.
The medieval world was rather diverse. It doesn't fit into neat categories and systems. The chief problem with feudalism is that it is anachronistic on the one hand, and impossible to usefully define on the other. It has little merit either as a representation of what was going on in medieval society up to c.1200x1300 or for systematising that society as historians.
Edit (addition):
This was a working draft of a conference paper I wrote (now discarded because it's far too long) but it explains the role of homage and its multiple functions:
I begin with a description and explication of one of the most famous medieval rituals: homage. Homage was an act in and of itself, but the ritual was often combined with two other distinct and not wholly necessary acts. As you can see from the image here the doer, kneeling, places his clasped hands between those of the receiver, while doing this he would utter his intention to become the man (hominium) of the receiver. Then, standing, the homager would recite an oath of fidelity, while touching a holy relic or the Gospels to sanctify his oath. Finally, the doer and the receiver would kiss. These rituals are layered in nuanced meaning carefully weighed for the public that would witness them – a vital mechanism for enforcement in a non-documentary legal culture – but even when legal apparatus began to take a written form the ritual remained popular and public.
Homage was done in this manner but there were a host of performative variables which are almost invariably lost to us in the dry charter source which survive. Did the doer bow their head in submission or meet the gaze of the receiver? Did the two share a cup or dish at the feast to further demonstrate their friendship, if a feast held at all? Yet its meaning was not solely constricted to one interpretation or used for one purpose. Homage can be somewhat anachronistically systematised into four key archetypes: 1) feudo-vassalic; 2) peacemaking; 3) recognition of status or rights; and 4) lateral agreements. So what do these archetypes mean? Well, they encapsulate the entire scope of high medieval politics in the Middle Ages.

Peter Thiel - 
If you have technological progress, that encourages a capitalist system. On the other hand, if you dont, you end up with much more of a zero sum game, with much less progress, and someone’s gain is someone else’s loss. In this scenario you get a bull market in politics, where people try to use government to get things for their particular interest group, and the whole thing can spiral downwards. It can become a vicious cycle where more government regulation leads to less technology, leads to greater demand for politics to redistribute the pie that is no longer growing. Fastest airplanes have gotten slower, medicine/healthcare has seen limited progress over last 20 years, energy has very limited progress. A lot of these sectors correlate with heavy government intervention.

If technology is stalled out, you will see a trend towards more government, even though it is less likely to fix things. 

Our gov is not engineers - substance and building things

            <Text>Chapter 4 : Moteah
  
______________


        Mandrameen was a poet, and Seculla was a trial lawyer. It might seem that these two callings are as distant from each other as Man is from Woman, but according to Seculla, they were essentially the same - just like Man and Woman. A poet and a lawyer both peddle in the Truth and appeal to human nature.The poet crafts verse and hopes that it will sing when played on the human heart, and the lawyer does the same, just does it more bluntly, with less rhyming and more certainty. The only real difference is that people’s lives are at stake - that and the fact that the lawyer gets paid by the hour.
        Whenever Mandrameen would lay with Seculla, he’d tease her about this. He would say, with a great deal of comic exaggeration, that if a lawyer is just a poet working for money, then a lawyer is no better than a whore. Money cheapens Virtue. A whore cheapens Honor. A lawyer cheapens the Truth. 
Seculla would wave him off with her usual air of grace. She’d argue that there’s no such thing as the Truth. A single murder recounted by three different witnesses will result in three different stories. Unless there’s a bloody knife in hand, we’re all invincibly ignorant. Almost everything boils down to a he-said she-said, yet everyone picks a side. They choose who they want to believe and then invent a rationale for it later. At least a lawyer’s accounting of the Truth is put through trial and error; that alone is enough to make it more valuable than anything any poet has ever written. 
It is little wonder that the two disagreed on how Jeketian society should be structured. Mandrameen believed that all human beings have certain fundamental rights, and that the Law should emanate from these and protect them. Seculla would say that it didn’t matter what anyone thought the law should be, there’s only what it is - a practical thing, a subject to circumstance, politics, and power. She contended that no one has anything by natural right; you only have what you can take for yourself, and you’ll have it for as long as you can defend it. There are no noble laws written on the hearts of men; there is only the law of self-interest.
Perhaps if Seculla had been alive to see the dynamics within Ayram’s band, she might not have been so quick to doubt that Humanity has an intrinsic moral compass. Perhaps if Mandrameen had seen it, he might not have liked the direction that the compass' needle was pointing, for it didn’t point to Liberty or Virtue, it pointed to Ayram. He was a Law unto himself. Within his band there was no contest of wills, there were no practical concerns of property or freedom. Everything was Ayram’s. Not just whatever gold and wealth they found, but every mind, every body, every husband, child, and wife; it was all offered in submission - and that was the thing - Ayram hadn’t taken it, it was all willingly given. 
It was strange to Pyetle, but he could see the natural sense of it. Ayram was just that big. He seemed ageless. In the evening, at the golden hour, when they climbed out of the pit and headed south over rolling dunes to where the horses were hidden, Pyetle thought he could see Ayram’s shadow extending out to the horizon. There was room enough in it to fit all of them.
Moteah trudged up and down the dunes at Pyetles' side. She was his minder.
“The time’s come, Pyetle” she said as Pyetle paused to catch his breath. “We’re going out to the Sand. There ain’t no place there for outsiders, so, you need to make a decision.”
“A decision about what?” Pyetle asked.
“Are you with us?”
“Well, yes,” he said. “I’m here. I’m with you.”
“No, Pyetle. Being with us means being one of us. There ain’t much of a distinction there, but - We don’t take on passengers.”
“You’re telling me to pull my weight.”
“Kind of. I don’t know why Ayram brought you here. You ain’t no killer, and you too old to learn. You don’t offer to help with anything, so you can’t be a roper.”
“A roper?”
Moteah nodded. “A roper. It’s what I call it. I’m a roper. We tie the group together, keep things running smooth.”
“Ah.”
“Every now and then, someone tries to run, and I rope them down.”
“You don’t need to threaten me. I’m not going to run anywhere.” 
Moteah laughed. “It’s a figure of speech, Pyetle. Can I call you Pye?”
Pyetle shrugged.
“Alright, Pye. What I mean is, sometimes some people forget what we doin it for, or they get sad, lonely, or just sick of it - the Sand ain’t a fun place to be - and that’s when I step in with my sunny disposition.” She looked at Pyetle and put on a big smile. Pyetle couldn’t help but smile back.
“You’re in charge of morale?” Pyetle asked.
“I ain’t in charge of nothing. I do what I can for people cause I want to. You have to want to do it.”
“You don’t think I’m that kind of person?”
“Obviously. That’s why I’m talkin to ya. If you ain’t good in a fight, then you need to be good out of it. So Pye, what good are ya?”
“Well… I know bean-curd.”
“Bean-curd?”
“Bean products, but mostly bean curd.”
“You a cook?”
“No. It’s more the buying and selling of it. I would buy soy-bean in bulk from farmers out in -”
“You a middle-man?”
Pyetle nodded. “It’s not as simple as that, but...I guess it doesn’t matter. Not many beans out here.”
Moteah laughed. “Not much buyin or sellin either.”
“I guess I could help out with whatever you need help with.”
Moteah shook her head. “Nah. We’ll find somethin. Ayram put you here, Pye. I learnt a long time ago that he knows best. But still, you need to make a decision to buy in - not just ‘cause we don’t tolerate outsiders. It’s for your own safety.”
“Safety from what?”
“There be things in the Sand that only Ayram can save you from. He won’t save you if you haven’t taken the oath.”
“And what does that involve?”
“It ain’t nothin serious. Well, it’s serious, but I mean, it ain’t nothin too painful.”
“Too painful?”
“It’s a blood oath, Pye. There’s gonna to be blood.”
Pyetle grimaced. “I don’t suppose I have a choice?”
“Oh, we’d kill you if you say no. But you shouldn’t take the oath just because you don’t want us to kill you.”
Pyetle laughed.
“What?” Moteah asked. “You’ve got to be doing it for the right reasons.”
“What reasons are those?”
Moteah shrugged. “It’s different for everyone.”
“Why did you join up?”
“Nah. That’s between me and Ayram.”
“So I either take the oath, or you kill me. That just doesn’t seem like… Well, let’s say I took the oath, but I just said the words without meaning them.”
“There’s no words.”
“Well, ok.... Let’s say I just went through the motions.”
“It ain’t that kind of oath. It’s more… how should I say it… It’s more primitive. Maybe oath ain’t the right word.” Moteah stood up. “You got until we reach them hills over there.” She pointed ahead to the tall foothills of the Junei Mountains. At their pace, they’d reach them by nightfall.
“Is that where the horses are?” Pyetle asked, eager to get in a saddle.
Moteah nodded. “Just about.”
“Well I can already tell you,” Pyetle said as he stood up. “I’m in.”
“Alright.”
Pyetle looked behind them, and say that Mazyd was struggling along. “What about Mazyd?” he asked.
        “The Seilsi?”
“Yeah.”
“What about him?”
“Well, Urghiz is a long way off.”
“Yeah.”
        “He’s in pretty bad shape. You think he’s going to make it?”
“Shit, I don’t know if you gonna to make it.” Moteah looked Pyetle up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness. “You don’t know how bad it is out there. It’s not just the heat.”
“I’ve been on caravans.”
“We ain’t keep to the roads.”
“Well if you’re concerned about me, then how is he gonna make it?” Pyetle asked, nodding in Mazyd’s direction. Moteah stopped him, and looked in his eyes with intent.
“Pye, I’m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.”
Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi, and there was no telling what he was capable of. There were rumors that Seilsi had strange biologies, but these rumors always conflicted, so Pyetle never gave them credence. One day a man would claim he saw a Seilsi jump over a crowd just because he could, while another would say he saw a Seilsi struggle to get up into a saddle. Some said they could see through walls, others said they were nearly blind.
There was a lot unusual about Mazyd’s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.
Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. 
“I could help with the Seilsi,” Pyetle suggested.
“Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.”
“I am worrying about myself. I’m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that’s something I could do.” 
Moteah rolled her eyes. “I’ll ask Pella about it.” She turned back to the course and trudged along. “Come on, we almost there.”

            <Title>Cascading Conflict: The Science of Violence</Title>
            <Text>Integrating complexity science with the study of violence.
Night on bear mountain - emotion, psychology, fear. The ways that we think in terms of violence - blaming warmongering leaders and so on - vs. Looking at fundamental mathematical principles. Trying to suss out statistical regularities, that don’t have to do with that kind of emotion, psychology, or individual agency. Universal laws that move from the micro to the cellular, even further to genes, fundamental principles of energy and matter, all the way to the macro of complex organisms and even social systems. 

- Lewis Richardson spawned this thinking- the coastline paradox - fractals. Scale-free theories. Things that occur at different scales but still occur at regular patterns. Richardson, using very little data and rudimentary math, posited that the frequency and the severity of deadly quarrels of all kinds could follow these universal statistical patterns called power laws that could explain severity and duration. 

Evolutionary thinking: Most people are neo-darwinian in their thoughts about warfare and violence. That goes back to Darwin’s The Descent of Man - in that book darwin describes war as an agent of human evolution, that somehow conflict facilitated a series of transitions into the modern state - borrows from Hobbes Leviathan - primitive state of existence is one of hostility. Elaborated by Herbert Spencer in his Social Statics in 1851 - But really, Darwin’s primary debt was to Malthus - pop growth/distribution of scarce resources leads inevitably to conflict. 
1940s and 50s, game theory pops up. Formal study of conflict of interest. 1960s darwinian theory got integrated with game theory.  Bill Hamilton - 4-fold classification of social behavior - behavior is : cooperative, selfish, mutualistic, spiteful. 

How do you move from selfishness to a state of cooperation?

In the last decades, that question has been revised. Question is probably wrong. Cooperative behavior is as primitive as selfish behavior. Returning to the question of culture. *IF* cooperation is as fundamental as selfishness, what role does culture play? Complexity lens looks for analogies between human conflict and conflict in the immune system. Is conflict just like aging and death? Is conflict just a result of copy-error that doesn’t get repaired? Issues of algorithmic intelligence. Is warfare just an instance of rule-systems gone wrong. We’re miscalculating some solution that manifests as aggression. 

Conflict avalanches in Africa - 
Ethiopia and Sudan - great lakes area 

Analogies in bio systems. If you watch the way these conflict events appear across the map, they’re not appearing randomly, they’re related to one another in some way. If you were to watch the patterns cascade and grow and die away, the system that came to my mind was of the brain. If you look at neurons in the brain and you track their activity, florescent indicator, you see something similar - neurons firing generating cascades of activity. 

Something active - spatial temporal activity - if I were an outsider looking at this abstract data set, I would say that things that are close to one another are related in some way.  What does it mean for two events that occur at different parts in the continent to be related? What you get when join these events together in clusters are these avalanches that move around in space. They grow and die. This is not what we think of as a war or battle. By constructing these structures we see things that are evocative of things elsewhere.

Richardson: once you get to a certain scale (tens of millions of fatalities), events grow in a self-similar and regular way.

Question of resolution of data set - conflict is hard to measure.

Biology avalanches - theres something about collective dynamics that imposes macroscopic regularity. Neural avalanches, Earthquake distributions, fires, - something universal going on with complex structures that take place within space and time. 

Oliver Sax - talked at length about how lesions in the brain change behaviour. 
The two extremes of explanation: biological determinism, and collective constraints is human freedom, where responsibility matters. We can’t *ignore* the limbic system.

Policing works better than pacifying
ONe common observation in primate groups is a division of labor. Individuals are voted into a position of authority that gives them the right to intervene into conflict without retribution.  Infinite debate on who polices the policers, is moot, because in society, that position is assigned to you. 
Pacifying is: “I’m angry.” “Ok, calm down, it’s not worth it, that person’s a jerk, etc”
Policing: intervention into an ongoing conflict. A more diplomatic solution. That kind of intervention can be extremely efficient, You only need a very small number of individuals who do policing in a population - leads to two possible outcomes : utopian outcome- whole population experiences low levels of aggression. If policing fails, where third-party intervention doesn’t work out, you get a police state: where everyone is policing.
On the one hand, policing is more efficient that Pacifying (You don’t need many police). BUT if policing fails, then you have a proliferation of the policing role, which is what you don’t want. 
The key point to policing working, is that the police are voted for. Its an emergent power structure. If the policing is imposed, that’s when it tends to fail. Systems of distributed control internally generate hierarchy - the hierarchy is voted for - thats what makes it work.

Conflict, if it is small and contained, can be beneficial.
You will have differing sources of infromation depending on where you are in the system. At some point, these differing sources of infromation have to be resolved if you are going to make a decision in society. If you are getting different information from different parts of your visual field, how can you reconcile those different pieces of information in order to make a decision about what to do in that environment. That is a low-level behaviour.
Analogy: if you go to a society, people have diversity of experiences, and have different informtion. You have to decide how that is going to be resolved. To a certain extend, some kind of conflict is necessary to resolve that information. There are some systems where noise plays a functional role - What Conflict is? Doesn’t necessarily mean people are going out and fighting.  What does conflict look like in these different systems? Does it make sense to compare conflict of physical information to conflict of physical violence?

Conflict and creativity exist in some complicated relationship. 
Conflict and computation: Ongoing conflict, by virtue of extending sampling, allows you to arrive at a more accurate read on power disparities. Conflict gives you extra time to evaluate the true nature of things. E.G.  We fight, I win, but unclear if it was a fluke, so we fight again. 

Conflict - biological : relative fitness - misaligned interests - for a certain outcome, in order to achieve my goal, you would have to pay a cost, and in order for you to reach your goal, I would have to  pay a cost.
Conflict - violence : conflict that violates a social norm. 
Conflict - warfare : use of technology to achieve objective.
Plants and animals using venom - these are all weapons that look like war.

A bird flock requires only a few to change direction - only a few individuals can stoke the conflict. Thats import because, say, this bird only has local information, but maybe this bird is the only one that sees the hawk. The information that it recieves has to be able to propogate to the entire flock - where almost nobody else can see the hawk. That ability to transmit info over long scales can serve a functional role. 
So what about conflict? Something that we’re exploring. In the context of monkeys, we can push certain individuals into it. 
Policy - when you impose a certian way of making decisions - in a democratic system, it becomes different - there is some sort of weak point; when you have a system that poised at the divide, you have a kind of dictator. If a person at the fulcrum, they can dictate the outcome.  In terms of voting systems, there are various systems that indicitive of who these individuals are.

Graveyards are full of people that were righteous

Mandrameen and Seculla first met at an evening river party. It was a government function, some Imperial Senator was entertaining some foreign dignitary, and so the wine was thin and the air was thick with ambition. Not a place for depressed people. They don’t have the stamina for it. Both Mandrameen and Seculla filtered through the pretension and collided in one corner of the tent where they clustered together for sanity. This sparked a relationship. They began to write letters back and forth.
Mandrameen found it difficult to explain that he was depressed because he came from old money. It’s not a sympathetic cause and so even he, with his prodigious creative talent, couldn’t mix and match words well enough to communicate the depth of it. Instead, he settled for talking about it in the abstract. He wrote to Seculla about how he hated the word ‘depression’.
 He remarked that a ‘depression’ is just a bit of land that’s a little lower than the surrounding area. It can vary in size, but if you’re walking along you’ll get through it in good time with no great effort. It’s not like climbing a mountain or swimming across the sea. It’s just a phase in what is otherwise perfectly healthy, normal, level ground. In other words a depression isn’t depressing. 
Mandrameen thought the use of the word was prejudicial. It gave well-put-together people the wrong idea about him. Made them feel that they understood where he was coming from. After all, everyone’s been sad, so everyone’s been through a little depression, so everyone thinks they’ve got the place mapped, but a real meaty nihilistic stupor, well Mandrameen knew it wasn’t on any goddamn map. You get lost there. You don’t come back.
Seculla wrote back that he was, again, being a fool. She pointed out that the most desolate and tortured place in the world was a depression: the Empty Portion. It’s an immense bowl of sand and it comprises almost a third of the continent. Unrelenting winds have whipped it since the dawn of creation: the Shamal blows in from the Caltian Sea, and the Kharif brings monsoons in from the south-west. 
The Empty Portion is not just a true desert, Seculla argued, it is the desert. No one has ever made it through the heart of it, much less to the Inner Mountain and back again. If ever there was a fitting object for Mandrameen’s analogy, that was it, and it was a depression, and it most certainly was on a map.
Mandrameen was too sentimental about the Sands to agree with her. The Empty Portion was unforgiving, yes, but for him it was full of mystery and feminine allure. He’d wax on about virginal passages and rich young men who fought to be the first to expose and penetrate its secrets. Besides, the Gods lived there, the Desert Fathers lived there, and so he couldn’t possibly think of it as depressing.
Eventually, and this took months, subtle lust worked enough agreeableness into them that they shared a conclusion: the feature of the Earth best suited to the task was the Underworld. The sun can’t reach there, so you can only see as far as the light that you carry. There is no color or life. There’s just the maze of rock, the abyss, and your own private thoughts. There’s nothing to do but wander and wait for death.
What they didn’t consider - what they didn’t know - was Fear. Not the blunt, cerebral fear that might keep the depressed in bed, but the sharp, waking fear that keeps a man running through the Underworld. Neither Mandrameen nor Seculla had ever truly gazed into the abyss. The real things, the avens of the Earth, they’re chittering-chattering throats that threaten to vomit out teeth and claws and demons should you turn your back. They spike the body with tension, they push out all thoughts and worries save one: Back. Out. Slowly. 
If Mandrameen and Seculla had ever been forced to crawl through the damp dark of the Underworld, as Pyetle was forced by Ayram and Hill, their error would have slapped them in the face. The only thing keeping Pyetle from losing his wits entirely was the drink. He couldn’t fixate on the terror even if he tried.
He would cast wary glances into dark tunnels as he passed them. He struggled to figure if the glowing eyes and shifting shadows he thought he saw were real or just glistening bits of rock. Ayram and Hill were moving too quickly to let his blurry eyes bring any particular fright into focus. ‘Keep moving’ was the order. Not just because of whatever might lurk in the dark, but because an icy breeze, the billows of the Earth, it was cold enough to condense the vapor of his breath into ice. 
With only a thin cotton tunic, Pyetle was especially chilled. The drink helped with that, too.
“Where are we going?” He whispered as he tramped along behind Hill. 
Hill didn’t stop to answer. He just grunted. 
“I just want to know where the hell -”
Hill paused and whipped round. “Were you never told stories of Swadin?”
Pyetle nodded. 
“Then be quiet!”
At this point Ayram had stopped as well. “We’ve got some miles to cover,” he said.
“Miles?” Pyetle mumbled. “You can find your way for miles?”
But Ayram was already turning back round to the path. Hill grunted again and followed along. Pyetle came flying behind.
The way meandered up and down, but it kept to a relative mean. Pyetle expected to be confronted at every turn by a vertical shaft or impassible slump of boulders - and there were plenty of these - but Ayram knew the ways around them. As they shifted around the ledge of one particularly jagged rent in the earth, a rock broke out from under Pyetle’s foot, and it fell into the darkness. The silence was horrifying. After a long age of seconds a stupefying, far-off boom rumbled below. Behind it came a cloud of steam and a wheezing, sulfurous hiss. Pyetle thought he saw a flash of green light deep down in the abyss. 
“Twelve seconds,” Ayram remarked.
“That makes it what?” Hill asked.
“Almost two hundred lengths.”
“Not deep enough.”
“Deep enough for what?” Pyetle asked.
“Let’s just say,” Hill said as he looked knowingly at Ayram, “that we’re safe for now.”
 Ayram led them on through a winding fissure and through a series of low-hung corridors. At times they had to crawl or squeeze through cracks, and again, it was worst for Pyetle. His cotton tunic did nothing to brunt the shocking chill of the rock and mud against his skin. It didn’t help that the torch-light’s narration of these passages was unreliable; hidden edges and shadowed protrusions stabbed and bruised his flesh as he scraped along. In an hour his tunic was reduced to wet rags. 
Each time he stumbled out of a crack he found that Ayram and Hill were further and further ahead. When it got to the point that he couldn’t see their dark figures cut out against torchlight, he yelled for them to wait. 
“Hill! Ayram!”
He hurried along, chasing the orange glow of Hill’s torch. If it grew any fainter it would take the rock around him with it. He could feel the darkness pushing in, closing down on him.
“Ayram!”
He rushed round a corner and nearly spilled onto marbled rock. Here the floor was carved and polished and cut with an intricate diamond pattern. It was as wide as a carriageway. The light of Hill’s torch climbed up straight and even walls then fell softly into shadow, unable to reach the distant ceiling - if indeed there was one. At the distant end of this great hall, Hill and Ayram stood at the threshold of an enormous double-door. 
They were whispering to each other. Hill seemed upset. Ayram shook him away, then pushed on the massive door. An awful grinding noise echoed down the hall towards Pyetle, and once there was enough room for Ayram to slip inside, he went in. Slowly, the door closed behind him. 
Hill turned round then jumped in fright when he saw Pyetle standing there in the middle distance, dimly lit, half-naked and muddy, with eyes as wide as saucers.
“Shyza!” Hill screamed. “Pyetle! I thought you a witherman!”
“Not one yet,” Pyetle grumbled as he marched towards the warmth of Hill’s torch. “But I might be made one soon in this damned place… Would it kill you to slow down?”
Hill smiled. “It could. Here, take this.” He handed Pyetle the torch, then undid the clasp of his black cloak and unwrapped it, then put it on Pyetle’s shoulders. Pyetle tugged it tight.
“That’s not how you wear it. Wrap it here, across chest, under arm. Yes. There you go. Is good?”
Pyetle nodded, then turned toward the doors. They were three times his height, arched in the middle, and engraved all up and down in rows were lines of soldiers.
“What is this place?” Pyetle asked. 
“Oh, don’t think of it.”
“Do you live here?”
“No, no, no, no. This is bad, bad place.”
“Can I go in?”
“NO. No, no, no, no.”
“Hill. Give me something here. I want to know what the hell is going on.”
“Oh… no for me to say. Let’s say that - Ayram do business here. But don’t think of it.”
“Don’t think of it? This is incredible! I’ve never even heard of something like this in the Underworld. The fact that people braved this foul place long enough to carve a-” Pyetle’s next words got stuck in his throat as his eyes fell upon the carved demon’s head set atop the door frame. Granite shoulders popped out of the rock next to it, and long, spindly arms spread all the way around the door-frame to the floor, where hands clutched the bottom of the doors, as if holding them up. 
“People built this, right?”
“Don’t think of it.”
“Ugh. Hill, man, what the hell do you expect me to think about? We’re in the Underworld, and that’s a fucking demon door, and Ayram just walked inside.”
“I think you still drunk, my friend.”
It surprised Pyetle to realize that he was still drunk. He looked back at the door. Nope. Still a demon door.
“Come, Pyetle, let me show you a thing.”
Hill took Pyetle by the shoulder and led him back down the hall and into the more familiar, the more natural part of the Underworld. Instead of turning left or right, he kept walking straight until he came, across the way, to another hall. 
This one was carved in the style of the early ancient Empire. Instead of swirling abstractions on the floor, there were columns and faces. There were figures embossed in the granite rock - slaves, cattle, brewers, butchers, weavers - enough obsequious faces to flatter the eternal slumber of any Solean Dynasty . 
Hill and Pyetle walked through them until they came to a stretch of graves dug into the wall. These were each sealed by a stone nameplate bearing the titles of a long-forgotten noble. 
Hill picked a rock and began to smash them in. Just a few hard blows was all it took.
“What are doing!?” Pyetle shrieked.
Hill continued to hammer away, shattering plaque after plaque. He would reach into the graves and sweep out a jumble of tattered woolen cloth and bone, then move on to the next. 
“Don’t do that!”Pyetle shouted.
“Why not?”
“They may be watching!”
“Let them watch. They’re dead. The selfish dits.”
“Fool! They might well be here!”
Hill stood up straight and looked around. “No see. No hear. No problem.”
“No problem? Don’t disturb them!”
“They are assholes. Assholes get disturbed. Heh.”
“Whatever these people did, their fate is yours if keep tempting it.”
“It’s not what they did, it’s what they are doing.”
“What are they doing?”
“Look at them!” Hill exclaimed, sweeping his arm out wide to point to all the graves.
Pyetle looked around expectantly. Squint as might, he couldn’t the slightest green shimmer of a wandering soul. He looked back at Hill in confusion.
“Where are they?” he asked.
“In the graves, idiot.”
“What of them?”
“These grelcha. They so indulgent. They so - how you say - full of themselves. Try to claim earth for all eternity.”
“You are mad that they built tombs?”
Hill nodded. “How selfish do you need? Steal a spot of earth even after you die. If I want that spot of earth I’m taking it. You dead. You not use. I will.”
“You’ll use it how? Are you going to crawl in one of these graves for a nap?”
“Oh, no. I do this on principle.”
“You do it out of spite.”
“What this mean - ‘spite’ ?”
“Your Common is too good to not know that word.”
Hill smiled. “Okay. I stop. Anyway, this not what I want to show. Come.” 
He led Pyetle further into the hall and stopped at a hole in the ground where part of the floor had given way to the abyss. It was about two lengths wide and it fell straight down. 
“What is it?” Pyetle asked.
“Listen to this.”
Hill pulled out his cock and began to pee into the hole. 
“Ew!” Pyetle howled. “You wanted me to watch you pee?” He grimaced and turned away. 
Hill snickered and kept at it. “You hear it?” he asked. 
Pyetle listened. There was no a-trickling splash. There wasn’t anything. There was silence. He looked over and saw Hill’s golden stream quietly speeding away into darkness.
“So what? It’s a deep hole. That’s what you wanted to show me?”
Just then, a tinny, zinging sound came echoing out of the hole.
zshhINGGGGgggggg
Hill looked back at Pyetle, smiling from ear to ear.
“Is weird noise, no?” he asked.
“Your urine made that noise?”
“What else?” Hill gave his cock a few shakes and put it away. “I think it have to do with how the rocks shape sound,” he said. 
Pyetle listened closely as the echoes ringed away. “I’ll have a go.”
“Yes! Go on.”
Pyetle handed Hill the torch then stepped over to the hole. He started to pull his cock out of his underwear, but stopped.
“Back up a bit, will you?” he said to Hill.
“Oh, sorry. Sorry. I Curious. You know.”
Pyetle shook his head and turned back to the abyss as it unfolded beneath his feet. He began to consider what it would be like to fall down it. How long would he hang in the darkness? As far as dying goes, he supposed the falling wouldn’t be so bad - but he didn’t like the darkness. He’d rather be able to see the bottom. There’d be something cathartic about falling for so long, a good ten seconds, knowing for at least that long that you’ve finally done it, that your fate is certain, its right there rushing up at you. That’s the moment he wanted frozen in his mind forever. 
His palms began sweat. He pulled out his cock and began to pee before the anxiousness could really have its way with him. 
Something brushed his shoulder. He screamed. He slipped. Urine sprayed all about. 
He fell into the hole.
Hill screamed after him. “Pyetle! shit!” He leaped so quickly to where Pyetle had stood that he almost fell down himself. He got down to his knees and lowered the torch down into the hole to see what he could see, but there was nothing but black.
“Pyetle!”
“I’m here!” 
Hill looked up to the ceiling and muttered a quick blessing to the Dreamer.
“I’m alright!” Pyetle yelled. “Your cloak snagged on something! I can’t reach it.”
“Don’t reach it, idiot!”
“Help me up.”
“Can you see me?”
“I can! I’m not far down. Lower a rope or something.”
“Hill! What are you doing?”
“Oh, Ayram! I was just… Pyetle - he pee into hole and then-”
“Ayram! Ayram, I’m stuck on a rock or something. Gods, I pissed myself.”
“Hill, why is Pyetle stuck in your piss-hole?”
“Don’t look at me! He jumped!”
“I didn’t jump! He pushed me! Well, he didn’t push me, he - fucking - I don’t know. Put a rope down!”
“Do you have rope, Hill?”
Hill shook his head.
“Did you just shake your head!?” Pyetle screamed up.
“You’re in a bit of a bind, Pyetle.” Ayram shouted down.
A drunken groan echoed up out of the hole. Hill put a wary eye on Ayram and whispered, “You have no big plans for him do you? He only a little old man. Little old cock, too.”
“Hill, he was your responsibility. That’s the second one you’ve disappointed. First Salavan, now this.”
“You can’t blame me for that! Or this! He was pissing… he jump into the hole!”
Ayram sneered.
“You can’t blame me for -”
“No, no. It’s the smell.”
“Oh.”
“Pyetle!” Ayram shouted.
“Yes?”
“I’ll lower down my bow as far as I can. That’s a few lengths, but you’ll have to climb up to it. I can’t see you, so I don’t know how far you’ll have to climb.”
Pyetle looked up at them - two dark heads cut out against the warm light, one much bigger than the other. He looked down into the unfathomable black. He wondered which prospect was preferable, up or down. Sure, he’d live if he climbed out, but living wasn’t all it’s cracked up to be. 
The cloak was snagged as good as if it had been sewn into the rock. Its threads were strong, tight-knit, and had been dry-waxed with a special unguent made from cow hoof, salt-sap, and spit, and Pyetle was as light as men come; there wasn’t a chance the cloak would rip any further. Not before he died of thirst. Or cold. He’d rather fall. Instead he just hung, legs and arms as limp as the rags of his tunic.
He curled and stretched his toes. He couldn’t see them. He twirled his feet.
“Pyetle. You climbing up? We not see.”
“Ayram!” Pyetle shouted.
“Yes?”
“Who are you?”
“What?”
“Who are you?”
“Are you climbing?”
“I’ll not climb until you answer.”
“Is he bargaining?” Hill whispered.
“Just spooked,” Ayram said.  Then he shouted down to Pyetle,  “There isn’t time for whatever the hell you think there’s time for.”
There was a moment of silence. Then Pyetle’s shrill voice came ringing up again.
“Who are you?”
“Climb on out!”
“I asked, ‘Who are you?’ ”
“Who are you?” Ayram asked in return.
“I am Pyetle! Who else could I be?”
“When I walked over here,” Ayram said, “all I saw was Hill shouting into a hole. Now a strange voice is shouting back. Pyetle might have fallen in, but he might have fallen to his death. You could be a demon lurking there in the dark!”
“Do I sound like a demon?”
“Aye, you do! 
Hill shouted down, “It be the way the rocks shape sound!”
“Hill!” Pyetle screamed. “Tell Ayram that I’m Pyetle!”
“We no can see you.”
“Climb on up!” Ayram shouted. “At least get high enough so that we can at least see who you are.”
“I can’t climb!”
“Why not? Do you have misshapen demon limbs?”
“The walls are smooth!”
“What are you talking about? There’s a crack here!” Ayram slapped part of the rock face where a deep crack ran down the side of the hole. “Doesn’t it run all the way down to where you are?”
“It does.”
“How wide is it?”
“About the width of three fingers.”
“Good! Perfect. It tapers down. It shouldn’t be too hard to climb up it.”
“I don’t know how to climb a crack!”
“Just stick your fingers in and pull down until they jam. Use your thumb for support or like a shim to get a tight fit.”
“Or stick your hand in side-ways,” Hill added.
“Yes, you can stick your whole hand in sideways and squeeze down. Get the meat of your palm and your fingers to stick.”
“Alright.”
“Squeeze, brace with your thumb, do what you can to inflate your hand in the crack so it’s nice and jammed.”
Pyetle spun himself round to face the rock. He reached up and stuck his fingers in and pulled down. He expected them to slip right out but they locked in place. He then felt out with his toes for a small cleft or angled face so that he could step and push himself up, but there was nothing but smooth undulations.
“What do I do with my feet?” he asked.
“Just stick them right in the crack. Keep your soles inward and your knees bowed out so that as you step up, your foot will naturally twist into the crack and jam in.”
“That sounds too easy.”
“It won’t be. It will hurt.”
As soon as Pyetle stuck his left foot into the crack he knew that it was going to hurt a lot. Even with a slight jam and twist, the rock threatened to rip his bare skin right open.
“I don’t think this will work!” he shouted up.
“You shouldn’t need to climb far.”
“Alright.”
Pyetle stuck his fingers back in and pulled again. He could already feel the skin starting to split on the sides of his knuckles. He stuck his right foot in the crack above his left. As he stepped up his foot twisted round and jammed in, but he hadn’t placed his hand high enough in the crack. As his body separated from rock face, his fingers started to slip out. He shot his other hand high into the crack to steady himself. Once recovered, he reached up even higher, high as could, and started again.
He did a little more this time to save his fingers. He groped around for a more relaxed fit, a more rounded edge. There was no saving the top of his foot. The bottom was calloused enough but the top of his foot’s skin was as soft and webby as pampered old woman’s.
He bit his lip and pushed up.  
“The crack gets wider!” he shouted.
“Yes. It tapers down.”
“It’s too many fingers!”
“Use a fist, then.”
Pyetle stuck his left fist in and wiggled his thumb around and pulled until it set. Up he went. With his next step he found he could fit his whole leg in the crack, up to his buttocks. He shimmied up like this until the crack got even wider, so wide that he could fit his fore-arm into a horizontal brace.
“Can you see me?” he shouted up.
“We can!”
“Well? How about it?”
Hill waved the torch around, trying make out more of Pyetle than the bald spot on the top of his head.
“You are not a demon,” he said, smirking aside to Ayram.
“How about you, Ayram?” Pyetle asked. 
Ayram stared down and Pyetle looked up. Pyetle can make out his eyes - just an immense figure. Even more sure that this wasn’t a simple human.
“On my word,” Ayram said, “I’ll tell you who I am if you climb up out of there.”
“Damn it!” Pyetle slammed his fist against the rock.
“Come on up, Pyetle.”
Pyetle shook his head and began to mutter to no one but the rock. 
“You losing him,” Hill whispered.
“Alright, Pyetle. Alright, “Ayram said. “You will come up if I tell you?”
Pyetle slapped his forehead against the rock. “Yes,” he said.
“Alright. But I can’t simply tell you.”
Pyetle looked up and asked, “Are you a demon?”
“No. You’ve no word in your language for me.”
“You aren’t a man?”
“Do you think I’m merely a man?”
“No.”
“And so it is.”
“What are you then?”
“My kind maps to form but not to language. I am something that is shown. I’m felt. Even across a distance - do you feel me now?”
Pyetle nodded. There was a pit in his stomach and it was filled with sorrow, rage, sdfaw.
“That is who I am. We have an accord, Pyetle, because you’re so lost. You’ve given up. I’m drawn to that. Without knowing it you called out to me, so here I am. We are in accord.”
“What does that mean?”
“Listen!” Hill shouted down.
“You are dead. As good as dead. Your life is torn and there is no putting it back together. Do you understand?”
“Yes.”
“Have I answered  your question well enough?”
“What do you want with me?
“You are a tool, and since you won’t use it, I am. I’m already pouring my will into you. You can feel it. Now climb out.”
“I don’t want to hurt people.”
 “You just killed a man!” Hill interjected.
 “Ignore the fool, Pyetle. You wont do anything you don’t want to do. Climb on out.” 
“Well. Okay then.”
Began again to shimmy up the hole.

 
Ayram grabs pyetle. Takes him under his arm. Something along the lines of  “Don’t want you jumping down any more holes.”
Pyetle was fine with it, because he was tired of walking.

Mazyd, trying to sympathise
The Empire is just a tool. We want the same thing. Murderers, rapist, thieves purged from the earth. The Empire was created for this purpose - a single culture that can bind the people together. For as long as there are other cultures, a suffuse of races, there will be excuses in the minds of men to murder, rape, and steal at demonic scale. That is Our purpose - to elimnate parochial altruism, to eliminate fear of the Other, by eliminating not ‘The other’, but the very notion of otherness. And the Empire is just a tool to do it - you must see that. If another, better way makes itself known, we would take it. But there is no other way.

Foul teeth. Foul breath. Foul words. But the foulness of it conveys a sense of reality, of certainty, of truth. Shiny white teeth and healthy smile would have no cause o call for the death of a man.  This was the earth itself and it could not be wrong.
Pyetle had a clubbed foot. He was old and bald and haggard. He had to gulp his sorrow before he spoke. He had lines in the tooth. He saw himself reflected in the rage. So he stood and screamed along with them. 
One sharp yelp. 
“Death!” 
Mazyd looked in his direction. The poor man’s stare was broken. Understanding. Forgiveness. Even shame. 
It locked Pyetle’s jaw and he pooped his pants.




“Now, my purpose. For those of you that don’t know, ‘Mazydei’ means ‘lights’ in Carcinian tongue. Saulistides intended for them to be the light of the world, beacons of virtue for all men to follow. Not human - for human could be so perfect. 






The Sacrosanct kept secret just how many Mazydei there were at any given moment, but there weren’t many. It should have been a great surprise to Pyetle to find himself locked in a cave cell with one of them. He was completely oblivious to the magnitude of the moment.  
His only concern was his discomfort. His centuries-old cell had been hollowed out of the sandstone, but it retained a bulbous and natural shape, so there was no corner in which to tuck himself away. He was forced to sit right up close to this stranger, who was slumbering away in the dark. There was just enough light that Pyetle could make out that the man was almost nude was covered in dried blood. What’s more is that he was missing his hands, and that on the stubs of his forearms were bandages so caked with glistening blood and pus that they were leaking. The poor wretch just lay there in the cool darkness, beaten and bloody, looking so much like a tortured soul from hell. The stench was haunting. Pyetle hardly dared to breathe.
This was a regular outlaw, Pyetle assumed, a thief of thieves who was being punished for his crimes in brutal frontier fashion. Pyetle did sense an aura about him, but it was unnaturalness, not greatness. Each time he looked upon the near-corpse of a man he was filled with a strange sense of discordance. When he finally mustered the courage to place it, he found that he wasn’t sure if the man were a man at all;  his features seemed feminine, and his frame was lithe and skinny, and the cloth which wrapped his groin seemed wrapped so tight that it couldn’t possibly contain any private parts. If he wasn’t a woman, he must have been a young castrato - older than boy, but young. 
There was also the fact that he didn’t seem to have any hair. There was no scruff on his chest, and he wasn’t just bald, he had no eyebrows. Though it was too dark to really tell, he seemed to be missing even his eyelashes.
All in all, it disgusted Pyetle. So great was his revulsion that he shuddered and tucked in his feet when the young man’s body suddenly curled up in a violent coughing fit.
Blood and spittle flew, and when it was over, the poor wretch wiped his lips with the pitiful stump of his arm. Pyetle expected him to whimper or sob after such a brutal wracking, but the lad simply lay his head back down against the rock and sighed.
He was awake.
The hairs on Pyetle’s arms and legs pricked up when he noticed that the young man’s eyes were open, glinting in the darkness. They were searching him over, studying him. Pyetle returned a weak smile, but felt foolish when he realized that he was sitting in the shadow and the young man probably couldn’t see it. They were just sitting there, the two of them, staring at each other in an uneasy bond of silence.
Pyetle felt he should say something, but the young man spoke first.
“Are you one of my jailers?” he asked. His voice was quite soft and clear, nearly a woman’s voice. It put Pyetle off a little to hear such pleasant tones coming from someone in  such a wretched state, and so he took an odd beat to respond.
“No.” he said. “I’m Pyetle. I’m not in control here if that's what you want to know.”
“Well, Pyetle, my name is Mazyd.” The young man closed his eyes and sighed again, wincing in pain as he tried to find a more comfortable position.
But Pyetle was eager for conversation.
“Fine day, Isn’t it?” he asked.
Mazyd did not answer. Instead, he took a deep breath, sat upright, and [c]asked a question out of turn. 
“Why are you here?”
“Well…” Pyetle mumbled as he searched for a good answer. “I guess you could say I’m a new recruit.” 
At that the Mazyd laughed, or rather, he tried to laugh but he fell into a cough - this time when the blood and spittle came out it stained Pyetle’s toes.
“Pardon me. Sorry. I would cover my mouth with my hands but -” and he held his arms,“ I was recently robbed of them.”
“Well... I, uh…”
“It’s all good,” Mazyd said with a chuckle. “I don’t blame you for falling in with these demons. We all do what we must. But why are you in here with me, if you’re one of them?”
“I was told that they don’t trust me just yet. Don’t want me slinking around their hideaway.”
“They don’t trust you?”
        “I’ve only just joined.”
“Do you trust them?” Mazyd asked.
“No… Well... I suppose I do a little… Actually no, I don’t at all. I was just thinking that, you know, I must be trusting them a little to let them whisk me away and throw me in here, but then again, I don’t really care if I live or die, I don’t care what happens to me, so it’s not really a matter of trust.”
Again the young man’s eyes flashed over Pyetle, who cut nearly as pitiful a figure there in the damp dark. Pyetle was small, skinny and balding. Every part of him was disheveled. 
“You don’t care if you die?” the young man asked. 
“Not really, no.”
“Why not?”
“Well…” Pyetle paused to consider his lot. “Im old. Old enough. I’ve lost too much. Too much loss, too late in life. Mix in some betrayal.”
“I see.”
“I just don’t have the energy or will to start up again. There’s just not enough time left for me, so even if I wanted to go back to the grind and work my life back up, there wouldn’t be any time left to just enjoy it all. So, it’s just a good time to give up.”
“Yet you took up with thieves?”
Pyetle shrugged. “This wasn’t planned. I’m only here because of a strange coincidence.”
“There’s no such thing as coincidence,” Mazyd said.
Pyetle nodded in mock acceptance. “Yes, yes,” he said. “Everything happens through the will of the Gods.”
        “That’s not what I mean.”
“Oh?”
“Just because you can’t see the chain of consequence that leads to your misery, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t one.”
“Well it’s good that you feel that way.” Pyetle said. He was a little stunned that Mazyd could be so sure of himself, considering his state. “That’s really good,” he repeated. “Impressive, really. If I were in you I’d be cursing everything. Fate especially. ”
“No, this is my fault,” Mayzd said. “At least, I don’t think it defies imagination to say that somewhere along the way I made a few mistakes.” Mazyd said this with a great deal of levity, and it surprised Pyetle to see the glint of Mazyd’s white teeth. The bloody pulp of a man was actually smiling.
“I suppose you’re right,” Pyetle said, smiling in turn. “But it doesn’t matter. Let’s just say that I happened upon the most striking person I’ve ever met at a pivotal crossroad in my life. That’s why I’m here.”
“Who was this person?”
“The leader of this robber band. His name is Ayram. You can’t have missed him.”
The young man shook his head and said, “I’ve only heard voices.”
“Well, when you meet him you’ll know who he is.”
Mazyd grunted in a show of indifference and slumped down against the rock. 
“Do you owe this man a debt?” he asked.
Pyetle sat back and considered Mazyd’s question, as he hadn’t thought of it. Did he owe Aryam a debt? Ayram had saved him from Death, but that in itself didn’t bother him. Sure, it would have been cruel to die at Salavan’s hands, so he supposed he could thank Ayram for that - but a debt? Ayram was going to kill Salavan anyways. The whole thing was just a coincidence.
He didn’t spend too long thinking about it, because even if there was an honor debt to be paid, he no longer cared about honor. That was a game for people with something to lose.
“No, he’s just an interesting person,” Pyetle finally said. “He’s immense. It’s not just his size, it’s his presence. It’s exciting just to be around him.”
        “So you decided to float along in his wake?”
“Something like that.”
“Well…” Mazyd said, straightening his back to sit upright, so that he might treat with Pyetle more personably ,“It’s nice to meet you, Pyetle.” He stuck out his arm for a handshake, then looked down at his bloody stump, and laughed. Pyetle laughed along with him.
“How about an elbow?” Pyetle asked, and he stuck his out. Mazyd bumped it with his own, and smiled again.
“It seems like neither of us have any friends here,” Mazyd said, “and I’m in a pretty bad way. Pyetle, I need a friend right now, and you’re it. You don’t have a choice. I don’t care if you’re not interested, do what you want. I’m a little desperate. I just need the glimmer of hope that a friend can give - even if it's a one-way deal.”
“I’m not -”
        “No, no, no,” Mazyd interrupted. “ You just do whatever you want. Just know that from this point on, whatever trust you put in me, I’ll treasure it.”
        Pyetle shrugged his shoulders.
“You do what you want,” Mazyd repeated. “My life isn’t worth much at the moment. They’ll probably kill me before tomorrow. I just don’t want to die without a friend nearby.”  
Pyetle wasn’t sure how to handle this doomed man’s wish. If Pyetle were younger, he would have humored Mazyd out of pity, but time had squeezed the empathy out of him. Plus, he didn’t know why Mazyd was locked up, nor why Ayram had elected to chop off his hands. It could have been simple theft, but it could be something unforgivable - Mazyd could be the kind of person to set his hands on another man’s wife. 
“Why are you in here?” Pyetle asked.
Mazyd sighed. “I was marching along with my people towards Jeket when your people ambushed us in the Junei hills.”
“What were you doing out there?”
Pyetle’s question gave Mazyd pause. He began to scrutinize his new friend. “We were about the Emperor’s business,” he said.
“What?”
        “That surprises you?”
“Well, yes. I figured you to be a thief.”
“No.”
“So, what, you’re a soldier?”
“More or less.”
        “Why did they cut off your hands?”
“Because I’m a magus.”
“Really?” Pyetle said, his voice pitching in excitement. “Could you show me a little something?” he asked.
        Mazyd just held up his bandaged arms to remind Pyetle of his predicament.
“Right,” said Pyetle, disappointed as much as the absence of proof for Mazyd’s story. “Well Mazyd, you’re either a fantastic thief and liar, or you’ve got the worst lot of any person  I’ve ever met - well anyone that’s lived past twenty. How old are you?”
“One hundred and twenty two.”
“What?
“One hundred and -” But before Mayzd could repeat the number, he was interrupted by the echoes of feet slapping on the damp stone outside. Then keys scratched at the lock, and the door creaked open. Torchlight flooded into the cell, giving Pyetle a clean view of Mazyd. The shock of him was nearly blinding. He wasn’t just covered in blood. His body from his feet up to his neck were covered in intricate arrangement of symbols tattooed in black. It was the unmistakable markings of a Mazydei. 
Pyetle’s jaw fell open.
“Oi, Sandie! He’s awake!”
“Well, bring him out then.”
One of the two captors stepped into the cell. He was a scruffy looking man with a long nose. 
“Can you stand up?” he asked Mazyd. “I’d help but I don’t want to touch you, mate.”
The woman behind him chuckled.  “Oh, help him up Deedee. You twit.”
“I’ll do no such thing.”
Mazyd looked to Pyetle, but Pytle was still stunned by the sight of him, so  he put his feet under his butt and labored up to a standing position by using the wall behind him for support.
“What about you?” Deedee asked. “You’re alright, right? Name’s Pyetle, right?”
Hearing his name spoken aloud snapped Pyetle to attention. “Yes, that is my name,” he said. 
“We’re off to a bit of a meeting. You’re invited.”
Pyetle stood up and stretched his back, all the while gawking at Mazyd. He’d never dreamed he’d see a Mazydei this up close, or in this place of all places. He followed Mazyd and Deedee out of the cell and into the cave proper, where Sandie waited. She was holding the only torch, and it’s flickering light illuminated the narrow slip of rock under her feet. The rest of the ground fell into a large blue-green pool of mineral water. 
Pyetle wondered what part of the continent’s drainage system this could possibly be. He had never heard of such a cave in this part of the world. It’s walls were waxy and seemed to be frozen mid-melt. Glistening strands of hard seemed to drip from the ceiling like saliva on the roof of a lizard’s mouth. The water was alive. Shapes moved and little lights flashed in its depths. Deedee swept Pyetle along before he had time to worry.
They moved on into a tunnel that led up towards the surface. With each step the rock became dryer, and the going got steeper. Mazyd struggled along. He walked with his elbows tucked tight against his body, fearing to brush his arms against a stray shadow of a rock. It compromised his balance, and coupled with the recent loss of blood, he was sure to move slowly.
The others accomodated him. Mazyd cut such a tragic figure that, even though Deedee and Sandie despised him in principle, they couldn’t help but pity him. They weren’t cruel people, but this little march felt cruel.
Here and there they would pass a tunnels that spread off in odd directions, up and down, skewing this way that, leading off into some unknown abyss.
“What created this place?” Pyetle wondered aloud.
“Hell if I know,” Deedee said. “Ayram might.”
        “Ayram knows,” Sandie corrected, but she didn’t expound upon it. Pyetle didn’t feel like he was in any position to ask to do so.  
Eventually, they came out into a massive open-air pit cave. Pyetle’s eyes took time to adjust, for the circle of sky above was bright and blue, and the sun’s light angled down the colossal sandstone walls and fell upon the sand in a dusty, radiant glow. 
Twenty-five of Ayram’s band were in attendance. They were a motley crew of every race and color, and they congregated on the shadowed side of the pit across from where Pyetle stood. This wasn’t a living space, and so there weren’t many furnishings - just a few logs and makeshift chairs to sit on, as well as a few crude tents set up on the sunny-side of the pit. There wasn’t anything that couldn’t be packed away at a moment's notice. 
Pyetle spied a few others high up on the rim. They were supposed to be lookouts, but they were eager to be down with the others, eager to be part of the buzz of excitement that filled the pit. This excitement was contagious. It worked its way into Pyetle when he, Mazyd, Deedee and Sandie made their way out into the sunlight. 
All chatter ceased and all eyes turned to them. None seemed to care much for Pyetle, as Mazyd’s pale and bloody pulp captivated the crowd.
One of their number stood up, and like the shadow of a tree he towered over the others. He let loose a shrill whistle for attention. Everyone else promptly sat down. The giant then began walke to Pyetle and his company, out of the shadow and into the light, and Pyetle saw that it was Ayram. Who else.
 Pyetle looked at Mazyd who stood transfixed in Ayram’s gaze. He wondered.Then there came a tugging at Pyetle’s shirt. It was Deedee.
He was beckoning Pyetle to follow and whispered, “Come on!” 
Pyetle trailed him around the edge of the pit to join the others in the pit’s shadow. Ayram began to speak just as he sat down.
“Before we decide what to do with this prisoner -” Ayram slapped Mazyd on the back. The action nearly buckled Mazyd’s knees. He looked like a child next to Ayram. Everyone does. 
“Before we decide what to do about him, we need to address Papi and Colm. It’s come to my attention that some of you are blaming Elrahet for their deaths.” Ayram had his arm extended out, and his piercing blue eyes were scanning the crowd, as if to accuse them all, even the ones who dared listened to the gossip. “That stops now.” 
He let the finality of his words echo around the pit. Whatever ill-will his people bore towards his witch, it was now gone.  
“In case you aren’t aware,” he continued, “this man here is a Mazydei!”
He shoved Mazyd forward and down to the ground. 
A chorus of whispered mutterings broke out in the crowd. Not all had descended from the Empire or the Solean religion, but they had all by now heard the rumors about their prisoner, and this startling confirmation settled on them like a wet blanket. 
Pyetle was especially moved to see a Mazydei brought so low.
“For those of you who don’t know,” Ayram said, “this slight excuse for a man is one of the Empire’s most lauded generals and one of its most coveted weapons. He could have killed us all in heartbeat if Elrahet’s storm hadn’t raged.”
“Elrahet!” cheered one of the crowd, and the rest clapped in approval.
“We should also thank Pella for her quick decision to take this scoundrel’s hands.” Even as Ayram said it, the cheers and plaudits grew loud for Pella. Pyetle followed Deedee’s gaze and saw an old woman soaking it. She was smiling and waving as if all the others were her children.
“Many more than just Papi and Colm would have died if it weren’t for that bolt of fire from the sky,” Ayram declared. “If my command is not enough, and any of you still have something to settle about Papi and Colm, then it's me you need to see. There’s no room in this life for bitch talk and rabble rousers. You have a problem, come see me.” He slapped his great chest with his fist, daring them to actually do it. “ I’ll be fair for as long as you are honest.”
“Now,” he said, turning to the crumpled form of Mazyd.  He reached down with one hand, grabbed him by the neck, and pulled him up to his feet. “What are you doing in my desert?”
Mazyd stood there, his face drawn tight in pain, and did not answer. 
“Speak, man!” Ayram shouted. “Is the Empire so scared of my family that they’d send you to root us out?”
Mazyd looked up at Ayram and said in the most matter of fact tone imaginable, “I don’t even know who you are.”
        Ayram grinned beneath his beard and a wild look came into his eyes. “You know, I can tell when someone is lying.”
“All I know is that your name is Ayram.”
“And your what is your name, sir?” Ayram asked.
“Mazyd Uro.” 
“Pella! Is this the one who burned your family alive?”
Pella shouted her answer. “No! I’ve not heard that name.”
“Mazyd Uro…” Ayram repeated. “You were sent to hunt us, yes? A devious Imperial trap, no?”
“Have you not stopped to consider,” Mazyd said with frustration, “That you were the trap for me?”
“Aye, but I don’t think anyone would reasonably expect that such a small band of simple thieves could overcome a Mazydei mage. No one would send a wolf like you into a den of foxes and expect it to lose. Hah!”
“Yet here I am.”
“Here you are indeed. But why? This won’t be over until I get an answer. I can get Elrahet involved if you like. A little blood magic will tease it out of you. You’ve got enough of it left, no?”
Mazyd looked out at the faces of the crowd. He found Pyetle’s and smiled.
“I was looking for your hovel in the mountains,” he said.
“We have no such place.”
“The Jandrian tribes. The place they’ve all fled to. It's some ruin in the mountains.”
“Urgiz?”
“Yes, that’s what they call it.”
“And what do you care about that forsaken place?”
For the first time, Mayzed took Ayram eye to eye, and said, “I was tasked to deliver a sword to your king.” 
A stillness swept over the crowd. One of them stood and shouted, “He lies!&quot;
Another stood and tried to shout him down. “A Mazydei does not lie!” 
Mazyd looked out at Ayram’s followers to let them judge for themselves the earnest truth written on his face. 
“The light of the law is coming to you and your kin!” he shouted.
“You mean the light of War!” 
“Barbarians make war,” Mazyd spat. “The Empire makes peace!”
His words set the band of outlaws buzzing. Pyetle was pushed into the sand as others rushed over him, each shouting “Murderer!”, and “Demon!”. Deedee was enraptured. He stood next to Pyetle’s and shouted, “Genocidal Demon!” so many times and with so much gusto that he nearly fainted. 
Ayram himself was unmoved. He held out his hand, but when that didn’t work he let loose another shrill whistle. The outlaws settled back down.
“We did find a sword,” Ayram said. “We found seventy-seven of them!”
At that there was a great cheer. Mazyd rolled his eyes.
“But yes, we did find an unusual one, too. Pella, bring it here.”
Old Pella got up, walked to Ayram, and pulled from her bundle of robes a wooden sword. It was immaculately carved and polished to a sheen. The base of its blade and its guard was inlaid with gold, and its half-shell pommel was trimmed with jade stars. Burned into its comically dull edge were words in old Carcinain. They read, “This blade will do as well as any other.”
The message was clear: when the Empire comes knocking, you might as well defend yourself with a stick.
        The sight of the sword quieted what was left of the grumbling crowd. A few wept. They were outlaws and they killed, but what the Empire had done to them and their kind was another thing entirely. 
        “This man thought he could stroll right into Urgiz and present this sword to Lindrimuud. He was so sure of his power that he thought he could stroll right out again! Look at him now. Well, I shall not be the one to stand in your way, Mazyd Uro. This sword belongs to Lindrimuud, and since the Emporer sent you to give it to him, then damn it, you’ll give it to him. But -” he brought his face close to Mazyd’s, “- you’ll not be walking out like you planned.”

            <Text>The Empty Portion
(Empty Quarter)
Middle Quarter

I thought of Buzz ldrin’s depression, his alcoholism, the way his existence was at once magnified and belittled by the experience of walking on the moon.

Desert or desart in their reports -f rom Latin adjective desertus, past participle of dererere: to abandon.

Europeans had no real conception of the world’s dry deserts until they started going to them. Look at the paintings of St. Antony. It was not only that vegetation was a requisite compositional device, the sheer sparsity of the Egyptian desert was as beyond imagining as the moon. Scarcely any of these paintings are without trees, and many show the abbot sitting primly in a landscape as lush as the apenninines in spring. 

Felix Fabri - dominican friar: Firstly, this country is called the desert because it seems to be, so to speak, deserted by god, as though god had used it to improve or adorn the rest of the universe… Secondly, this country is called the lonesome place, because no one longs for that land… Thirdly, this country iscalled the solitary place, because it is unfrequented by men. It is solitary because none of the countries which lie round about it wish to have any connection with or likeness to that land.

He goes on to tell that the desert is the image of death, that nothing grows there, that it is waterless, salt, pathless, inhabited only by serpents, scorpions, dispades ( a kind of snake whose bite causes intolerable thirst), worms, dragons, fauns, and satyrs; a place of demonic temptation, where great merit isacquired, and where lthe laws and commandments were given.

W.J.McGee - 1906 “Desert Thirst as Disease” - doctor and geographer
Finding guy left in the desert for just four days with one  days ater:
Pable was stark naked; his formely full-muscled legs and arms were shrunken and scrawny; his ribs edged out like those of a starving horse; his habitually plethoric abdomen was drawn in almost aganst his vertebral column; his lips had disappeared as if amputated, leaving low edges of blackened tissue; his teeth and gums projected like those of a skinned animal, but the flesh was black and dry as a hank of jerky; his nose was withered and shrunken to half its length; his lostril lining showing black; his eyes were set in a winkless stare, with surrounding skin so contracted as to expose the conjunctiva, itself black as the gums; his face was dark as a degro, and his skin generally turned a ghastly purplish yet ashen grey, with great livid blotches and streaks; his lower legs and feet, with forearms and hands, were torn and scratched by contact with thorns and sharp rocks, yet even the freshest cuts were as so many scratches in dry leather, without trace of blood or serum; his joints and bones stood out like those of a wasted sickling, though the skin clung to them in a way suggesting shrunken rawhide used in repairing a broken wheel. 

^Desert gothic. It is as if he has been possessed by the spirit of the desert or rendered into some calculus of all its extremes. The impression above all is of an organic being reduced to the mineral - this is what the desert does, before it scatters you. He is half-deaf, half-blind;  and there’s one last foul detail: “his tounge shrunken to a mere bunch of black integument.”
McGee douses him with water, “the skin first shedding then absorbing it greedily as a dry sponge.” From shrunken rawhide to sponge. Valencia’s revival from living mummy is in fact remarkably quick: within an hour he is drinking, within two he cna manage a little “ bird fricassee with rice and shredded bacon.” All it takes is water.
Having set out on foot, he became disoriented and exhausted. His canteen was soon empty. “He found some relief - after the fashion of all Mexicans and most Americans in like cases - by occasionally filling his mouth and gargling his throat with urine.
Two days after leaving the camp, he lay down in an arroyo and discarded his shoes and trousers. This shedding of clothes is common among those dying in the desert - instinctive but lethal, since clothing is all that shields you from the sun. The following day he chewed some paloverde twigs and ate som spiders. He became convinced that Rios had deliberately abandoned him (perhaps he did). It was this conviction that “spurred him on with the aim of knifing his deceiver.”
He found a familiar trail that would return him to camp, but soon fell under the heat and lay all day long in an arroyo. That eveneing, as he made his way along, he glimpsed a coyote following him at a distance. By no the urine he had been carrying in the canteen as mucho malo, “very bad.”
Five days after Valencia’s last taste of water, the buzzards which had been monitoring him for two days came almost within hand-reach. The next day his urine having ceased to flow, he felt his last recourse gone. The following evening McGee was woken by those distant bellowings, the dead man was alive, or rather he was not wholly dead.
McGee isolates five stages of thirst:
“Normal dryness”, “functional derangement, “The cottonmouth phase,” “The phase of the shrivlled toungue, “THe stage of structural degeneration,” “Death”.
Modern medics: mild (dry mouth, rapid breathing), moderate (reduced skin-turgor, sunken eyes and irritability), extreme (cold extremities, no blood pressure)

The Immesurable world:

A depression the size of France, occupying a third of the Arabian Peninsula, the Empty Quarter is bounded to the north…. THis tremendous bowl of sand has been stirred, clockwise for perhaps two million years, by two great winds: the shamal that sweeps across the arabian gulf from Iraq, and the Kharif that brings the south-west monsoon to soak Dhofar.

A blade of light drops from the distant peaks of the rincons, down the foothills and towards me across the alluvial plain, until slowly, like a lava flow, the threshold where light meets shadow approaches the cabin - and then: there!

The Desert Fathers, the third- and fourth century solitaires of Upper Egypt, and the first of them, St. Antony. 

St. Antony and St. Paul and a loaf of bread.
When St. Antony left his home, the young man retired alone to a hut in the desert - bit it wasn’t far, hardly the true desert at all, just a place outside the village walls. There he was besieged by the devil’s temptations: memories of his former comforts, his abandoned sister, the promise of money and glory, and above all the “spirit of fornication.” 

“In the bole of a dead tree.”

He traveled still further into the desert, deeper into the devil’s domain, like a military scout preceding an invasion. 
“By now he has become an iconic figure and must fend off acolytes as well as demons. He travels still deeper into the desert, until he reaches the place that would be his home for the rest of his life: the foothills of the south galala mountains. This story of a step-by-step progression into oblivion, from the lush Nile floodplain to the arid interior, became a model for others wishing to renounce society. According to St. Athanasius, “ cells filled with holy bands of men who said psalms, loved reading, fasted, prayed, rejoiced in the hope of things to come, laboured in almsgiving and preserved love and harmony, one with the other.” 

“Even among the women, the metaphor of sexual conquest was near-ubiquitous: time and again the feminised desert was unveiled, exposed, vanquished and finally penetrated. My bedding was dusty with dried binding-glue. 

For geographoers, deserts are simply places where the average annual rainfall is less than 250 millimeteres, and where precipitation, by rain or fog or dew, is exceeded by potential evapotranspiration (evaporation and the transpiration of plants). The aridity index four categories of drylands:  Hyper-arid, arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid. 

The model desert journey is a progression from the sub-humid to the hyper-arid, from the Nile to the “Inner Mountain,” 

In the Vitae Patrum, the collected sayings and biographies of the Desert Fathers, published in the seventeenth century, we learn of the paneremos: at once the place of uttermost lifelessness, and teh locus where the desert’s identity was most purely asserted, and that point furthest from the periphery. Polar explorers have another term: the Pole of Maximum Inaccessibility. This it seemed was the ultimate objective of every desert traeller: the axis where the absolute coexists with the infinite. 

A depression the size of France, occupying a third of the Arabian Peninsula, the Empty Quarter is bounded to the north…. THis tremendous bowl of sand has been stirred, clockwise for perhaps two million years, by two great winds: the shamal that sweeps across the arabian gulf from Iraq, and the Kharif that brings the south-west monsoon to soak Dhofar. 

Rub’ Al-Khali - none have ever crossed the heart of it. It is a name of terror throught rbia. 

Two kinds of tribes: those who you have a blood feud with, and those who dont. Both want your camels and arms, the second want your life as well.

It hs become difficult to be a pioneer. THe world has been done. THere are only the adventurers now, this new breed of fanatic: rangy large-toothed guys seeking not knowledge or even territory but novelty, managed suffering, “Experience”, mterial, sponsorship - K2 by canoe, the Amazon by bike, the North Pole on stilts. 

A brief catlike rigidifying, then the recovery of sangfroid.

I could feel his breath on my eyeballs - breathing the same air.

We had left the peripheral gravel plains behind. Underfoot was a floor of cracked white clay dusted with red sand. Between us and the mountainous pink dunes that fomred the horizon were only two salt bushes, long dead. 

As Nigel spoke, the realisation was dawning on me that I would die if Hassan, our guide, did not return. Never before had I known so intensely my life’s dependence on another. It was as if I had been dosed with poison whose antidote he alone possessed. And where was Hassan?


Rolling scrolls of circulation (wind) are known as Hadley Cells.
Deserts in equator, but als, Along the western coasts of the continents, se winds cool the air, reducing its capacity to hold moisture and preventing the formation of clouds, contributing to the creation of ‘coastal’ deserts such as Chile’s Atacama and southern Africa’s Namib. This effect is amplified in the southern hemisphere by the influence of anti-clockwise ocean gyres, which carry cold water to the west coasts of the continents. Meanwhile, winds arriving from the east have surrendered any moisture to the parched land. Moreover, the sheer remoteness and size of many deserts - thos of australia and central asia - mean that vapour from the sea simply can’t reach them. So dryness is partly a factor of isolation. 

In Oman fertile land exists in two thin strips: the arable corridor of Batinah, which runs north-west from Muscat; and in the south the Dhofar coastal plain, where Salalah lies… When air confronts a ountain range, such s the jabl Qara, it cools as it climbs, forming rainclouds that sap its moisture. 

We entered the nejd, a rubbled karstland dissected by broad wadis that had not run for generations and scattered with cement-coloured bergs of limestone. Pink sand had been banked along the road’s eastern verge by last night’s winds.

The alluvial boulders strewing the hamadah became rocks; the rocks became smaller black nodules of basalt, laid down in rows upon the paler grit as if by a harrow. THe land had been progressively degraded, growing flatter and smoother as it became drier.

Hasan was from a mountain tribe. He had a neat black beard and a steady, strategising gaze of  the kind I associate with both artists and military men… He wore a white headcloth, and a white dishdasha, grease-fingered across its front. ON his feet were perished black rubber sandals. 

Dust devils shimmied in the middle distance. You blinked and they’d vanished. In the heat-haze the horizon lifted like a page in a draught. For eighty kilometeres just these gavel plains, more relentless in their aridity than even the Empty Qurter’s heart. At least in the Sands, for Bertram Thomas and his retinue, there had been occasional waterholes; here, for camel-days, there would be nothing, not so much as a frond of ailing saltbush, and no shelter for anything bigger than an invertebrate.

There had been a quiet sifting of the land as we’d dropped down from the mountains: solid to particulate, coarse to smooth, hard to soft; almost indiscernable.

A boulder warmed will expand; cooling it will contract. Repeated over a hundred thousand days and nights, the opposing pressures will begin to undo the rock’s integrity. Tiny fractures will appear and widen; in high-altitude deserts frost will enter these cracks and jemmy them apart; salt will seep into the rocks as a solution and in crystallising expand the cracks still further (a process known as salt-jacking). The boulder thus divides and subdivides, spalling and flaking and crumbling, and with the wind and water, the pieces will be dispersed. And so mountains become boulders, and boulders rocks, and rocks stons, then gravel, shingle, grit sand - ultimately, dust. 

Rising from the plains, the dunes were visible from twenty kilometers away. After the hours of ash-like grey and pale cracked clay, it was as if we were nearing a new reality, one that seemed as gorgeous and auspicious, from afar, as the world of dreams. Here was a place for a checkpoint, I thought, a true border. I sensed Hassan’s relief. 
From the desert’s edge, crescent dunes no bigger than whales encroached on to the plain like scouts sent ahead of a vast school clamouring to their rear. 

Religious ablution (ritual washing)

We entered the dunes and almost instantly it was impossible to tell in which direction lay the plains we had just come across. To one lost in a maze, teh outer passages are indistinguishable from the interior. I was reminded that one of the Arabic words for desert is a synonym of labyrinth. 
The dunes at the desert’s edge were beach-size, but kilometere by kilometee their stature grew. It was like nothing I had experienced save for being at sea. As if hassan were piloting a skiff over choppy straits, our path up and down the dunes assumed a rhythm: a pass identified; a roar of acceleration; then the momentary sensation of equivocation on the wind stropped cresst, before the sudden plumet. 
After an hour we found Mohammed’s Land Cruiser in the centre of a flat rink of gypsum. Soran the camel was couched nearby. 

Under the seat of his Land Cruiser he kept a ceremonial sword, which he would sometimes unsheathe and, with a glance to ensure you were watching, throw spearlike into a dune.

So loved was Mohammed by Soran that the mere sound of his vehicle approaching would send the camel into groans of exaltation. 

I clambered barefoot to teh summit of a tall dune nearby. It took twenty minutes. The sand under my soles was losing its warmth, as if life were abandoning it. Like a pond it was cool beneath the surface. From there, maybe thirty meteres up, the desert laid out before me was brinkless, its coulours shifting by the second as the sun went down; but its vastness was not of the sublime kind that induces unease. The scale wasn’t belittling, because one had no sense of one’s own size in proportion to it. 

Camels’ night vision, Mohammed told me, is exceptional. “If your camel looks slowly left to right, it is a fox. If your camel stops chewing and stares into the darkness, something is wrong.”
Soran was yellow, with a dark bushy hackle along his spine, smaller than the all-black brutes loitering alongside the road from Thumrait. He wore a smile of beatific forbearance, and was the object of lavish tenderness on the part of Hassan and Mohammed - tenderness born of respect, even love. They would no more shout at or beat him than they would the sagest of grandfathers. 

The main quality sought in a desert campsite, other than shade from the sun as it rises, is shelter from the wind. It’s thought that most of the dunes accumulated some million years ago, during the Late Quaternary period, when winds even stronger than today’s winnowed sand from both the wadis of the peninsula’s interior and the Arabian Gulf. The wind continues to be a potent presence: it shapes and reshapes the dunes, and , during the day, is as constant as the sun. The sun heats the morning sands, the warm air rises and must be replaced. Hence the wind ubiquitous in desert literature. 

Army sent to vanquish the lord of the desert wind. 
Bertram Thomas: story of a party of the Mahra tribe who pursued a band of camel raiders into a part of the desert unknown to them, only for a wind to rise and obliterate the tracks they had been following. “Six months later one of my own party of rashidis came upon the seven skeletons and the bones of their camels.”
THe desert is mobile and wind its engine. The wind shapes the dunes. To travel in the Empty Quarter is to see their forms - “species”, as they are known - in their infinite permutations. The desert is formed chiefly of the uruq variety (from the arabic ‘vein’ ), towering parallel ridges sometimes tens of kilometers long, and crescenet-shaped barchans(From “horn”), whose tips point in the direction of the prevailing wind. But few deserts, even the great ergs or “sand seas” of the Sahara, ar forme dof sand alone. In the southern marches you experience not a pure dune-land, an endless beach, but a rather a complex of arenas. THe sand is quartz; anything softer will be ground to dust and blown away. Each surface grain accumulates a rind of ferric oxide, and it is this that accounts for the arabian dune’s characterisitic redness. 
The dunes are spearated by Shuquq, interdune corridors - elongated plaines of brown gravel and white gypsum; while the dunes are barriers exahausting to man, camel, and vehicle alike, these flat plains are the desert’s highways. From their edges archaologist have recovered the bones of water buffalo, the shells of freshwater molluscs, and the teeth of hippopotami. For, some twenty five-thousand years ago, during a cold phase, these plains were lakes. 

IT was where the sand melded into a gypsum plain that two ravens came to inspect me, as I was walking alone the following morning, soon after dawn.


Sulphurous water - there is no water so tainted, that a thirsty camel will not drink it.

That night, nigel was in pain. HIs inner thighs brused from the hours of riding’ but eh was genial and solicitous, and from time to time he woudl get up from his cmp chair to speak tenderly to soran, to stroke his muzzle and feed him flatbreads. 

Better to be straddling a camel, miles from the nearest waterhole, than hemmed in by men made from beeswax and snuff

You might trvel to escape the self, but in the desert of all places, where there is little else, you are thrown back upon your mind and your body with intensified force. Quietness offers no liberation, after all: there had been midnights when I swear my libido - whatever it consists of - was audible (somewhere between a stiff door and a backed up drain). Nope, the body was there; the body was there more than ever, and with it all its claims.


A badu asked for the heart of another pure black speciment which he proposed to eat whole because of some virtue it possessed.

The desert was not only vast: there was intimacy in its involutions and granularity- the cool mouth of a tunnel dug by a mouse; the arc scribed by a windblown strand of vegetation; the campfires dome of light. 

“The sands,” wrote Thomas, “are a public diary… No bird may alight, no wild beast or insect pass but needs must leave its history.”

A frission passed between us when his quick marks resolved into recognisable form. 

Its glutted smirk. 

Guy drawing in th sand. Again and again, between animals, there was the woman. When she first appeared he laughed, as if she had come unbidden; we both laughed. But then, as the face emerged, he became quiet with concentration. THe point of the twig moving across teh sand was suddenly the desert’s centre. 

Hour after hour,” Thesiger wrote, “Day after day, we moved forward and nothing changed; the desert met the empty sky always the same distance ahead of us. Time and space were one.”

Stillness - but the desert is not still. As a shaping force, the wind has a quality that water lacks: the ability to flow uphill. From the pinnacle of a dune a skein of spindrift is spun into the sky; along a dune-brink, a hundred tiny cyclones shimmy in line; a sheet of sand scuds over a ridge like a spool of paper rushing through a press. 

The desert is refashioning itself. Nod off in an exposed place and you will wake to find you have been partnered by a buttress of sand, The smallest twig will accumulate a humb in its lee. It is how the mega dunes began. Subtly the desert is in motion. 

Father of European monasticism, John Cassian, who had lived for years in Wadi Natrun, described condition known as accidie, which, he said, “we ma describe as tedium or perturbation of heart. It is akin to dejection, and especially felt by solitaries, a persistent and objnoxious enemy of those who dwell in the desert.”

Tinnitus, deafness, reaction from noiselessness of the deasert

Without witnesses, how do you conduct yourself? In the secrecy of any imagination, to what extremes might the mind wander? I’d found I was drawn to the lawlessness of the desert; not only the way norms might be suspended but how, in the absence of regulation or judgement, the word good itself was loosed from meaning. 

Nuclear bombs tested in the desert.

Coming upon your own tracks you made 4 years earlier

Fence to stop camels from falling in - similar to seals on a cliff, they just have no concept of height, of falling, having never come into it before. 
 
A characteristic of eucalyptus is that its bark peels off in long ribbons, and at yalata these ribbons hung from the limbs and swung back and forth under a slight breeze.

At first I mistook the low intermittent roar I kept hearing for jets, but I realised that it was only the noise the wind made in the dry boughs of the malee. Although it was not particularly loud, there was somehow a massive suppressed energy contined within it, like the enrgy of a rally waiting to be addressed.

This was also the liberty the desert permitted: the moral liberty available to us in drems, the liberty to perpetrate outrages.

The Anangu’s relationship with the land is a matter of religion. You do not, for example, clear a waterhole in order to maintain a watersupply, but because it is your obligation to the ancestors. Your lawful obligation. THere is no founding myth of alienation from nature no Fall, for the distinction doe not exist: there is no “nature” to be alienated from. The desert is a place neither of banishment nor of tonement. It is not  your proving ground. It is not your sanctuary. It is not St. Antony’s relm of demonic temptation; nor, above all, is it the “hideous blank” of the pioneers.
The desert monotheisms tip their heads skywards, seek divinity in the heavens. Anangu know that it is the land, the ground beneath the feet, where the creative spirit resides. 

With whom was a white man expected to sign a treaty? Could a wandering black be said to “own” a claypan or a mountain? Does the dingo own the plain he crosses in search of food? Does the kangaroo own the rockhole he pauses to drink from?

Now, to shoot a dog in front of an aboriginal person is a real big nono. Because tey treate those dogs like children. Literally like children. They sleep with the dogs, they use them for hunting, the use them to keep warm. I’ve seen a dead bitch with six pups there, and the old girls will walk straight over - the dog might have got run over - and the pups will be looking for the mother for milk. THe girls will walk straight over, grab the whole six pups, and they’ll go to the young women, and they might have a baby on the tit, they’ll give them two pups, and she’ll put a pup on the tit straightaway.

Edie when she entered the shower blcok was relieved to see another black woman: but when she spoke to her she received no answer; the woman merely stared. It took her a moment to understand that she had spoken to her reflection, that she was lone.

He went to sleep in the rain drunk, and got pneumonia and died.

“Whenever a white man finds something of value to him in any aboriginal area the aborigines are pushed aside, he said.
“This individual was placing the affairs of a handful of natives above those of the British Commonwealth of Nations.”
- 

150 km of peak-and-trough sandhills. Occasionally camels could be spotted milling in mobs between trees. Ahead of us was the claypan, a two-km wide disc of red like an unglazed plate glowing in a kiln. Emu Field. 
In its clarity the air was to normal air as normal air is to water. It was as if I had been given back the vision of childhood. It is a characteristic of arid places, this clarity caused by the absence of vapour. Claypans are ephemeral lakes, basins into which surface water will drain when there is sufficient precipitation, carrying with it fine sediment. In arid environments, where evaporation exceeds precipitations, such basins are usually covered with water only briefly and shallowly for a few days each year. What chiefly characterises claypans - like theyr counterparts, playas - is their flatness, their furface being graded and swept afresh with each inundation of water. 
The floor of the pan, scarcely rising or falling so much as a centimetre in elevation across the entire five square kilometers of its expanse, was cracked into irregular polygons and scurfing like a eucalyptus, and each of its palm sized scales shoe with a fine and perfect salt glaze. It was like walking over the surface of an old oil painting. The gloss added to the illusion o fwetness; where it reflected thesky, the ground was blue. A last cruelyt to the dying trveler. The appearance tryly was of water, even from a fairly short distance, like the ghost of its last flooding. 
I followed a line of prints, camel prints made when the pan was wet, gouged deep andmessy, the pan-surface littered with the scuffed up clay. Despite their soggy appearance the prints and the clay alike were, of course, hard and unyielding as terracotta. 

The world was assuming the mauve tinge of night

A few weeks earlier a man’s body had been found in the northern territory alongside his bogged car with a note: he’d been collecting brush to put under his wheels for traction, and had been snakebit.

Desert people white and black, accustomed to the phenomena of the desert and knew that dust storms did not make their approach in windless silence. - inject this into ch1 where elrahat is summoning.

The camp moved twice - each time there is a death. 


But emplymentwas not enough to tempt them to set foot here. It was not just that it had been made hazardous and a place of grief, or that they were haunted, it was more that to go there was akin to necrophilia. THe land was dead, and only the mad consort with corpses.

If the desert is a hiding place for human crimes it is also an abyss into which those who shame, disgust or threaten us may be swept.

In china, people exiled to the desert. Families of criminals who had been executed for, say, murder, or incest, or treason. Disgraced government officials, or troublemakers, who had criticised official corruption or associated with ocnvicted trators. Ttooed on both temples like a double stamp of lading: your crime on the right; on the left your destination. 

Whereas for indigenous australians the desert is an infinite mosaic of symbols and storie, they hyper-arid deserts of china have figured as mere interstices, or collectively as a dread realm entered under duress or to reach the next oasis, even among those who populate the desert’s edge. 
V”The wester roads are difficult and bad;sand streams stretch far and wide; evil sprites and hot winds, when the y come, cannot be avoided.”

The blacksmith’s son was ‘so profligate that his father took a sledge-hamer and crushed his head as he lay asleep’.

“Inspired by sorrow too heavy for the careful balance of literary values, yet unbearable unless expressed in words.”

West was teh Gobi, a rugged, ash-coloured plain coated with grit and low clumps of tamarisk and camel thorn. 

It was impossible to know where one named desert ended and the next began, where Gobi became black gobi, where gashun gobi degenerated into the kumtag desert and the salt-fields of lop nor, where the threshold was between lop nor, and the taklamakan. And no sooner had I established that one desert lay here and another there, or that this one abutted that, than I read or was told that, no, the black gobi ends here and teh gashun gobi is not there, but five hundred kilometers north.



A solitary christian grave could be made out, with its double headstone, epitatphs sand-scoured to illegibility. 

Personal friendships were slightly scorned in the toostrong mental atmosphere of evangilne’s home, where anything approaching sentimentality was anathema. She herself was ‘robustuous, obstreperous, and rebellious, and convinced that there was something so essentially wrong with the world that nothing but revolution could set it right. 

Her terrifying task was to tame herself in the glorification of God.

STANDARD MANUSCRIPT FORMAT
          by A. Nonymous

         Standard manuscript format is often required for novels so that
work can easily be read by editors. It allows editors to estimate
word count and determine roughly how many pages will be required to
produce a book using the page size, style and font used by their house.
This PDF file was generated using Scrivener's Compile feature and
was created using the &quot;Novel&quot; project template.

         Manuscripts for full-length novels require a separate title
page. The author's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address
should be shown in the upper-left corner of the title page,
single-spaced. The title of the story should appear in all-caps about
half-way down the page. The author's name follows the title on the
by-line as the author wants it to appear when published. A real name
or pseudonym may be used and may include initials, actual given name
or professional designation.


                                                               Nonymous / STANDARD FORMAT / 2

         All text should be double-spaced and left-justified with a
ragged right margin. Paragraphs should be indented by about five
spaces (half an inch) and not separated by an additional blank line.
(It used to be traditional to separate each sentence with two spaces,
but in these days of word processors this is now less common.) A
12-point font such as Courier, Times New Roman or Arial should be
used throughout. In Scrivener, however, you can write using any font
and formatting you choose--the &quot;Formatting&quot; pane of the Compile
dialog can be used to change the formatting in the compiled document.
In the &quot;Novel&quot; project template, the Compile settings will deal with
changing the font and formatting to those required for standard
manuscript format.

         Top, bottom, left and right margins should all be approximately
one inch, not allowing for the page header. Each page except for the
title page should include a header comprising the author's real
surname, the title of the work (or a key word from the title) in
capitals, and the page number. In Scrivener, all of this is handled
in the &quot;Page Settings&quot; pane of the Compile dialog.

                                                          #
         Scene breaks are indicated with the hash character. Do not
simply add an extra line space as this can be missed by the typesetter.
The &quot;Separators&quot; pane of Scrivener's Compile dialog can handle this
for you if you are writing each scene as a separate text document.
         Indicate italics by underlining. In Scrivener, you can use

italics and set them to be converted to underlines upon export or
print by using &quot;Convert italics to underlines&quot; in the
&quot;Transformations&quot; pane of the Compile dialog.

                                       Another Chapter Folder

         Begin each new chapter on a new page like this with the chapter
number about a third of the way down the page. In Scrivener, this
can all be dealt with in the Compile settings. The &quot;Separators&quot; pane
of the Compile dialog can be set to start a new page for each chapter
folder, and the &quot;Formatting&quot; pane can be used to add page padding
at the top of the new page and insert the chapter number (the latter
by selecting &quot;Section Layout...&quot;). All of this has already been done
for you in the &quot;Standard Manuscript Format&quot; compile preset, used by
default for the &quot;Novel&quot; project template.

         Although it is often said that writers should not use the
word-count features of their computers to determine the number of
words in a manuscript, most publishers and editors will happily
accept a word processor word count these days. In Scrivener, you can
insert a word count of your manuscript by using Edit &gt; Insert &gt; Draft


                                                               Nonymous / STANDARD FORMAT / 5

Word Count. (In the &quot;Novel&quot; template, where the Draft folder has been
renamed &quot;Manuscript&quot;, this menu option will also be renamed
&quot;Manuscript Word Count&quot;.) For a full-length novel, you may wish to
choose &quot;Rounded to Nearest 100&quot;, as on the title page of this
manuscript, or &quot;Rounded to Nearest 1000&quot;. Note that the actual word
count will not be inserted, but a tag that will be replaced by the
word count upon export.

         In reality, the formatting of a manuscript is often only really
crucial when submitting directly to a publisher--first time
novelists will usually submit to an agent first, and agents are often
less picky about format and will point you in the right direction
before submitting your work to a publisher.

Remove a column supporting a roof, and theres no longer compression - you’ve got a zone of tensile stress, where the material above the tunnel is trying to pull away from itself. Many materials react differently to tension that compression, and soil and rock are no different. Soil has lotsofstrength against compression, but none against tension. You can’t make a rope out of soil. It has no tension strength.  So if you build a tunnel in soil, you have to replace the column you removed with some other way to transfer the load of the tension above. Rock does have tensile strength. You could make a rope from it. Rocks have breaks, cracks, jointing. Natural jointing follow specific patterns that can be mapped. Rocks that are whole are called massive. Jointed rocks have no tensile strength- the’ll fall right out.</Text>

            <Text>This book of short stories really fucks you up as a writer. You’ve got to remember this was his entire life here. Not one-year of short stories.

At that time he was spending all kinds of money around women trying to make himself seem a man and fool people, but it did’t have any effect on people that knew anything about him. He owed me over 600 pesos and he wouldn’t pay me. “Why do you want it now?” he’d say. “Don’t you trust me? Aren’t we friends?”
… There’s a queen for you. You can’t touch them. Nothing, nothing can touch them. They spend money on themselves or for vanity, but they never pay. Try to get one to pay. I told him what I thought of him right there o the Gran Via, in front of three friends, but he speaks to me now when I meet him as though we were friends. What kind of blood is it that makes a man like that?

A Natural History of the Dead
When that persevereing traveller, Mungo Park, was at one period of his course fainting in the vast wilderness of an african desert, naked and alone, considering his days as numbered and nothing appearing to remain for him to do but to lie down and die, a small moss-flower of extraordinary beauty caught his eye. “Though the whole plant,” says he, “was no larger than one of my fingers, I could not contemplate the delicate conformation of its roots, leaves and capsules without admiration. Can the being who planted, watered and brought to perfection in this obscure part of the world, a thing which appears of so small importance, look with unconcern upon the situation and suffering of creatures formed after his own image? Surely not. Reflections like these would not allow me to despair; I started p and, disregarding both hunger and fatigue, travelled forawrd, assured that relief was at hand. 
In war teh dead are usually the male of the human species although this does not hold true with animals, and I have frequently seen dead mares among the horses. 
Most of those mules that I saw dead were along mountain roads or lying at the foot of steep declivities whence they had been pushed to rid the road of their encumbrnce.  THey seemed a fitting enough sight in the mountains where one was accustomed to their presence and looked less incongruous there than they did later, at Smyrna, where the Greeks broke the legs of all their baggage animals and pushed them off the quy into the shallow water to drown. 
Regarding teh sex of the dead it is a fact that one becomes so accustomed to the sight of all the dead men that the sight of a dead woman is quite shocking. 
We agreed too that the picking up of the fragments had been an extraordinary business; it being amazing that the human body should be blown into pieces which wxploded along no anatomical lines, but rather divided as capriciously as the fragmentation in the burst of a high explosive shell.
Color change in caucasian races is from white to yellow to yellow-green to black. If left long enough in the heat the flesh comes to resemble coal-tar- especially where it has been broken or torn, and It has a quite a visible tarlike iridescence. They grow larger each day until sometimes they become to big for their uniforms, filling these until they seem blown tight enough to burst. The individual members may increase in girth to an unbelievable extent and face fill as taut and globular as balloons. 
The smeel cannot be remembered. IT is gon as completely as when you have been in love; you remember thigns that happened, but the sensation cannot be recalled.
The first thing you found about the dead was that, hit badly enough, they died like animals. Some quickly from a little wound you would not think would kill a rabbit. Some died like cats; a skull broken in and iron in the brain, they lie alive two days like cats that crawl into the coal bin with a bullet in the brain and will not die until you cut their heads off. 
The only natural death I’ve ever seen, outside of loss of blood, which isn’t bad, was death from Spanish influenza. In this you drown in mucus, choking, and how you know the patient’s dead is: at the end he turns to be a little child again, though with his manly force, and fills the sheets as full as any diaper with on vast, final, yellow cataract that flows and dribbles on after he’s gone. 
…that had seen the hot weather with a half pint of maggots working where their mouths have been. 
…wearing an alpine hat with an eagle feather in it and a hole in front you couldn’t put your little finger in and a hole in the back you could put your fist in, if iti were a small fist and you wanted to put it there. 

“A peasant with a black beard and high leather boots stood beside the grave. The sexton stopped shovelling and straightened his back. The peasant in the high boots took the spade from the sexton and went on filling in the grave -&gt; It’s the way he repeats ‘peasant in the high boots’  - reduces the man to a peasant in high boots. A prop. No room for dimension.
NO pronouns.
“The reset of the time it was spoiled by the sun. We were both tired of the sun. You could not get away from the sun.” 

Hemingway: the only shadows were made by rocks or by they hut that was built under the protection of a rock beside a glacier, and in the shade the sweat froze in your underclothing. You could not sit outside the hut without dark glasses. 

Hemingway: German peasant came to bury his wife: “No. He can only come, from where he lives, on skis until the snow melts. SO today he brought her in to be buried and the priest, when he looked at her face, didn’t want to bury her. You go on and tell it,” he said to the sexton. “SPek German, not dialect.”
“It was very funny with the priest,” said the sexton. “In the report to the commune she died of heart trouble. We knew she had heart trouble here. She used to faint in church sometimes. She did not come for a long time. She wasn’t strong to climb. When the priest uncovered her face he asked Olz, ‘Did your wife suffer much?’ ‘No,’ said Olz. ‘When I came in the house she was dead across the bed.’
“The priest looked at her again, He didn’t like it.
“ ‘How did her face get that way?’
“ ‘I dont know’, Olz said.
“ ‘Youd better find out,’ the priest said, and put the blanket back. Olz didn’t say anything. THe priest looked at him. Olz looked back at the priest. ‘You want to know?’
“ ‘ I must know’, the priest said.”
“This is where it’s good,” the innkeeper said. “Listen to this. Go on Franz.”
“ ‘ Well,’ said Olz, ‘when she died I made the report to the commune and I put her in the shed across the top of the big wood. When I started to use the big wood she was stiff and I put her up against the wall. Her mouth was open and when I came into the shed at night to cut up the big wood, I hung the lantern from it.’
“ ‘ Why did you do that?’ asked the priest.
“ ‘I don’t know,’ said Olz.
“ ‘ Did you do that many times?’
“ ‘Every time I went to work in the shed at night.’
“ ‘It was very wrong,’ said the priest. ‘Did you love your wife?’
“ ‘Ja, I loved her,’ Olz said. ‘I loved her fine.’ “</Text>

            <Text>
When Sober, Pyetle would take the opportunity to wallow in his depression. Sober as he was, and stuck in the Ayramun’s pit cave, he had little else to do, so he closed his eyes and conjured up the memory which would not let him be: the memory of his father marching out into the Sand.
Pyetle could still recall the excitement of the day. All of Drissel had turned out to see his father off because the prospect that Sol’s Stone could be found by the men of their town was a point of local pride. It was also a holiday, the twelfth of Zun - Sol’s birthday. That meant all the little boys got to chase the Great Demon Damdramood through the streets. Even though Pyetle was only ten, and small for a ten-year-old, it was he who tackled Damdramood and knocked the prop stone out of his hands. As part of the celebrations, he gave the stone to his father. His father joked that now he didn’t have to go, since Sol’s Stone was sitting right there in his hands.

His father was marching under the command of a pale Imperial prince, and they were marching out to the Inner Mountain to find. His father was twenty-eight. The pale Imperial prince who rode at the head was just fourteen. Pyetle waved and waved until he couldn’t distinguish his father’s white silhouette from the rest of the expedition. 
Later that day, a smithy  could remember those telling him how legendary his father would be, how proud he should be. But Pyetle had reached that age where people arent sure how much the child really understands, how much he really sees, so the didn’t make any around him to hide their jesting comments of doubt, their smiles and about open positions here there, fresh opportunities for advancement. 
It was then he realized that no one thought his father would make it back. He didn’t.
Pyetle had no more tears for this memory. He’d already cried at every part of it. At the _. At teh _. And that’s what made so effective as a depressing instrument; it was a long drawn note that had lost it’s soul. IT could no longer stir the fire inside of him. At this age, it had finally pulled it all out. 
Out in the sand, Pyetle’s story wasn’t an uncommon one. He looked at around at the rest of the Ayramun, at their strange deformities, and wondered just how bad they’d had it as kinds. That tempered the mood. He had spent his long life feeling sorry for himself , but now, stuck as he was in the cold shadow of the Ayramun’s pit cave, he felt a little guilty about it. Only a little, though. All the other Ayramun had clothes and leathers to keep out the cold breath of the Underworld as it crept into the pit cave. All Pyetle had was Hill’s cloak. The thin, ragged tunic he’d gotten from Salavan’s wasn’t doing a thing.
When he asked if he could climb up and out of the cave so that he could get warm, Hill had said no; no one was allowed to leave until dusk for fear of being spotted by Imperial eyes. Pyetle wasn’t allowed a fire for the same reason. Hill told him to just bear it. “This the life of us Ayramun,” he had said. “And it not so bad. You not complain earlier?” 
Hill left before Pyetle could explain that the reason he didn’t complain earlier was because he drunk, so when the icy breath of the Underworld chilled his fingers and toes he couldn’t ignore it. His sobriety was making him regret the whole situation, so he decided to scan the cave for signs of alcohol.
The rest of the Ayramun were mostly huddled together in little groups. None of them were drinking. Those that weren’t sleeping were whispering about things Pyetle couldn’t hear, sometimes in languages he had never heard. Without anything to do dwell on his discomfort, Pyetle turned away, wrapped Hill’s cloak tighter around his bare skin, and tried to sleep.
He lay there for half a hand or so, shivering, counting his miseries: Twenty for his freezing fingers and toes. Five for the cuts he’d gotten on his hands and feet while scrambling through the Underworld. Count his blessings? There weren’t any. At least, there weren’t any until Moteah sauntered over with a bothered look on her face.
“Did Renny come by yet?” she asked as she leered over him. “He was supposed to give you some clothes.” 
“No,” Pyetle said. “I Haven’t heard of anyone named Renny.”
“Of course you haven’t. I should have known. He is an idiot.” Moteah said. “One thing you should know is that most of these boys are idiots. Idiots in their own, unique, way. You’ll never stop being surprised by new kinds of dumb. Come on. Let’s get you sorted out.” She motioned for Pyetle to follow, and so he did.
As they made their way across the pit they passed Mazyd. He was sleeping comfortably under a blanket. Just beyond him a burly man sat smoking a sash of freeweed. As Pyetle stepped closer he realized this man wasn’t thick-set, he was just hunchbacked and his head seemed impacted down on his shoulders. At a distance it gave the impression of a strong upper body. Like the rest of the Ayramun, Renny’s sun-leathered skin had gone red from years of lathering it with protective kell-oil, and his greasy hair was sunbleached like a Jandrian child’s. All the Ayramun were blended together by years of kell-oil and sun; pale Carcinians, dark Zozans, native Jandrians, at a glance the Ayramun could be mistaken for a blood tribe. If it weren’t for the more glaring physical deformities it would be hard to tell them apart. 
Moteah stopped right next to this man, shook her head, and pointed at him with an accusatory finger.
“Did you give that Seilsi a blanket?” she asked. The hunchback nodded and said, “I did. I wanted the bastard to freeze but Sob was sick of the whimpering. Made me gave him a full set of wools, too.”
“Unbelievable,” Moteah said.
“I know. You’d think Sob would want to make the bastard uncomfortable. Sob should want it more than anyone.”
Moteah then nodded towards Pyetle and asked, “Renny, do you know who that is?”
Renny’s eyes flicked to Pyetle. “That’s the new guy,” he said.
“His name is Pyetle,” Moteah corrected. “And is there anything wrong with him?”
Renny paused is piping and gave Pyetle a good once-over. As his eyes went up and down, his leathered face slowly scrunched up, like he’d smelled something bad. “He’s a bit old, isn’t he? It’s not nice pointing out flaws though, is it?” he said.
Moteah gave Renny a quick smack on the back of his head. “He’s nearly naked,” she said. “You were supposed to get him some clothes.”
“That’s Sob’s fault,” Renny whined. “I tried to get Papi’s clothes from Sob, but he wouldn’t give them.”
“He wouldn’t give them?”
Renny pointed over his shoulder with his thumb, “Sob is right over there. Ask him yourself.” 
“That’s no excuse. You were supposed to get the clothes.”
“I don’t deal with Sob. Man’s an idiot.”
“Oh, is he?”
“He’s right over there,” Renny repeated.
It seemed to Pyetle that Moteah was seriously considering giving Renny another smack. The way that Renny was trying his hardest to flaunt a lack of concern, by smoking his weed, pretending to savor it with a easy sigh, pretending to let Moteah’s glare run off his hunched shoulders, it was as good as challenge. 
But with the grace of a woman whose learned long ago to pick her battles, Moteah turned on her heel and headed off to where Sob was sleeping. Pyetle followed.
Sob was a gangly man, and he was stretched out against the cave wall. He was sleeping in such a way, face down, that it seemed like he was trying bury himself into the crack between the ground and the foot of the rock. 
Moteah pointed at him with an upset finger. “This is Sob,” she said.
Sob stirred when he heard his name, but he’d heard the the irritation in Moteah’s voice too so he just grunted and didn’t move further.
Then Moteah jabbed Sob in the ribs with her foot, and Sob rolled over to sneer. 
The shock of Sob’s face nearly knocked Pyetle over, for Sob’s bony features were twisted around his head to the right, as if something had knocked his face that way as a child and it just kept growing in that direction. It was so askew that his right eye and his nose were almost even with his right ear. His left eye and mouth were more or less where they were supposed to be, so his whole face was stretched in two directions. He could look at two things at once. When Sob glared at Moteah, he other eye was glaring at Pyetle, too. 
Moteah was unmoved. She gave Sob another kick. 
“You’re a damned idiot,” she said.
“Come off it,” Sob moaned.
“You gave the Seilsi a blanket, clothes, but you left Pyetle in rags?”
Sob shrugged and made to go back to sleep, so Moteah gave him another kick. This one was a little harder.
“Hey!” Sob shouted. 
“You’ve got shit for brains,” Moteah said.
“That Seilsi wouldn’t stop whimpering ‘til I propped him a cover,” Sob protested.
“And Pyetle? Should he have to whimper to get your attention?” Moteah then pointed to Sob’s pillow. It was a bundle of clothes that had been rolled up with twine. “Are those Papi’s clothes?” she asked.
Sob patted the bundle with care. “I needed a pillow,” he said. “Besides, this old boy, Pyetle is he? He’s no Ayramun. Not yet. Let him freeze.”
Moteah tried to kick Sob again, but Sob recoiled before the blow could land. 
“Alright! Alright!” he shouted. “Put your damned pointy foot away. I’ll get him out o’ those tatters.” 
One of the many unfortunate things about Sob’s twisted face was that it gave him the sense of being two-faced, because even when he put on a genuine smile, the right half of his face didn’t seem to agree with it. Nonetheless, he made an effort, and Pyetle was present enough to take it for what it was, even though it made the hairs on his arm stand on end. 
“Go on, then,” Sob said, tossing the wrapped bundle of clothes at Pyetle’s feet. “But you need be remembering whose clothes those really belong.”
“I’ve heard,” Pyetle said. “They’re Papi’s.”
“No.” Sob scowled. “They’re Ayrams.”
“They’re Ayram’s?” Pyetle repeated in astonishment. “I can’t fit into his clothes.”
“They’re not Ayram’s, Ayram’s,” Sob said. “Everything’s Ayram’s ‘ere. Clothes on me back. Even your tatters. Moteah’s shoes. The food in yorn belly. It’s all loaned out, if ye like. We’re the Ayramun. Everything’s Ayram’s. Never yours. But go on. Pick summat out.”
Pyetle picked up the bundle. He pulled at the plaited hemp string and unrolled the clothes onto the ground. He picked out a few items that looked comfortable. There was a thick white linen tunic that was crumpled with salt and sweat, some brown leather pants with a black stripe sewn vertically down the sides, and a pair of rawhide sandals that, when he put them on, seemed cut perfectly to size. It was all in good shape, but the shirt had a blood stain around the collar and the the sleeves were singed near the wrists. He didn’t complain though. He was just thankful to have some comfort from the chill.
When he had finally put it all on, Sob looked him up and down with a keen interest and said, “Those be Papi’s things.”
“I thought you said they were Ayram’s.”
“Yeah, everything’s Ayram’s. Papi was wearin’ them, though.”
“Who is Papi?” Pyetle asked.
“His name was Papillian,” Moteah said.
Sob nodded. “Lad’s dead,” he said. He pointed to Pyetle’s shirt and his lips spread into another warped smile. “That’s three days old blood, that is. He was wearin them clothes when he died, he was. Bit rude to be wearin’ them clothes so soon, innit?”
Pyetle looked down at the burn marks on his sleeves. He wondered if this was some kind of joke. “I don’t suppose you’ve got anything else I could wear?” he asked.
“There’s nothing wrong with those,” Moteah said.
“You don’t want a run of Papi’s luck, I take it?” Sob asked.
“He won’t have to worry about that,” Moteah said. “He’s got Hill’s cloak.”
“Does he now?”
Moteah smirked and affirmed it. “He’s got Hill’s lucky cloak. In fact it’s already saved him once.”
“Hill’s lucky cloak, has he? Well… How’d you get it off him?”
Pyetle spread the cloak out behind him with a flourish. “Hill gave it to me,” he said. “Didn’t know it was a lucky cloak, though.”
“He simply gave it? Lucky you. But not so lucky now with Papi’s things, I think. Probably the clothes all cancel it out.”
“What do you mean?”
“You have a good luck cloak there but bad luck everything else. Bad luck ‘cause, well, Papi was wearin’ ‘em, weren’t he?”
“So, the luck all cancels out?”
“Aye. But you can’t have no luck at all. No luck is just bad luck.”
Moteah rolled her eyes. “Sob knows all about luck. Don’t you Sob,” she said.
“Right I do. Here - what’s your name again?” Sob asked.
“My name is Pyetle.”
Sob took a round pouch the size of a fist from his things and loosed the string to reveal an assortment of rocks and pebbles rolling about inside. “Alright, Pyetle, take one o’ me rocks. As token of apology. These rocks have been tested. They’re only small measures of luck, sure, but they should do the trick.”
“They’re lucky rocks?” Pyetle asked as he eyed the stones with an eyebrow raised.
“Of course,” Sob said with a sneer. The fact that Pyetle was expressing doubt seemed offensive to him, and so Sob drew out his frustration with a sneer. “If I say they’ve been tested, they’ve been tested.”
“Tested how?”
Sob threw up his hands. “How do you test anythin’? You pick it up, try to do somethin’ with it, then see what happens. If it works, good chance the thing is lucky. If it works ten times over, then its been tested, ain’t it?”
“I guess.”
“You keep the real unlucky rocks, too,” Sob continued. “They’re not as good as a curse pot, but if someone gets to pesterin’ you, and you think they need a spot of bad-luck, slip a bad-luck pebble into their pocket. They’re good for that. Little stones of retribution. I keep mine separate.” Sob then took another pouch from out of his things, and opened it to reveal another bunch of rocks. Each of these had a white ‘X’ carved into them. Sob picked one of them up and smiled at Moteah while he thumbed it’s grooves.
“Ever seen one of these, Moteah?” he asked.
She didn’t say anything back.
Pyetle, eager to cut through the hostility that was shaping up between the two, decided to distract the hostilities with a question. He didn’t have to put much effort into pretending to care about the answer, because this was a tactic he’d learned from his mother while even in the womb. “The thing I don’t understand is, how does it all work?”
“What do you mean?” Sob asked.
“How does luck move from a thing to a person? Does luck rub off like dust, or is it some kind of ‘aura’ which accounts for all the things on a person, or what?”
“Don’t get him started,” Moteah said, but Pyetle’s question had hooked Sob with ease. The poor man jumped right into his theory of luck.
“It’s a bit strange, isn’t it,” Sob said. “You could certainly think of it like luck rubbing off. But I suppose more like a flow of energy. But there’s mechanics to it. There’s little quirks you got to learn by experience. You may wonder why I was restin’ my head on Papi’s clothes, considerin’ they’re unlucky. See, when your sleepin’, unlucky things will drain the un-luck out of ye, and good luck things will drain the good luck out of you. But that’s only when you’re sleepin’. ‘Cause when we’re sleeping we become inanimate things, subject to natural forces. Otherwise, when we’re awake and moving about and decidin’ things, it’s the normal mechanics of luck. But like I say, there’s quirks to it.”
“What are the normal mechanics of luck?”
“You know - luck. You know how luck works.”
“I don’t.”
“You don’t know… A fella as old as you?”
Moteah snorted. “He’s putting you on, Sob,” she said. “Nobody cares about this.”
“I am not,” Pyetle lied. “I want to know how luck works. I mean my life’s been shit, and maybe that’s because I’ve not been paying attention to this kind of thing. If there’s mechanics to luck, it’s worth hearing about.”
Moteah was stunned. “Look at him,” she said, pointing to Sob. “If it’s possible to know how luck works, you think he knows about it? Sob’s the unluckiest bastard I’ve ever met. Look at his face. Oh, he doesn’t mind. He knows he’s ugly as hell. But even without that, it’s not like he’s in a better way than any of us. He’s Ayramun, and by any law of Nature, he should be dead, just like the rest of us.”
Pyetle was a little stunned by Moteah’s bluntness, but Sob wasn’t. Neither was he offended. His face was alight with relish, his smile was the wry smile of a man whose combantant had just set him up with the perfect stage to make a point.
“But that’s just the thing!” he said, left eye wide with excitement. “It’s the lucky ones that don’t know a thing about luck because they don’t need to! They putter around, never steppin’ in any holes, and so they think that holes don’t exist! Never trust a lucky man’s view of things. But someone like me, I’ve stepped in all the holes, I know my way around them by now. I’ve got Luck mapped as well as anybody whose ever lived.”
“There’s no real thing as luck,” Moteah countered. “And if there is, you certainly don’t know about it.”
Sob turned to Pyetle to plead his case. “Pyetle, if I shoot an arrow at you, what says whether or not it kills you?”
“Luck?”
Moteah interjected. “Luck has nothing to do with it. It’s skill.”
“It’s luck!” Sob retorted. “Skill says whether or not you hit the target. Aim at the neck, and if you’re skilled, you hit the neck. Luck says whether it hits a vein or the muscle.”
Moteah groaned. “No one walks away from a shot in the neck,” she said.
“What do you call this, then?” Sob replied. He pulled at his collar to reveal a long white scar that wrapped round the left side of his neck. “Arrow that did this was shot from just twenty paces. Right through me neck. Was a shot by some merc from the Isle of Screte, no less; as skilled as any Aryamun with a bow. But his arrow as unlucky. The count of the luck between the the wood, the feathers, the glue, the string, the arrowhead, it wasn’t enough to beat me. And half my luck is these stones. I’d wager more than money that my stones is what saved me. Like you say, my natural luck is shit.”
“Alright then,” Moteah said. “Let’s make a bet. Let me ‘test’ one of your ‘lucky stones’.”
“You know I don’t bet. Not morally right for me to be takin’ advantage of others in matters of luck. But enough talk,” Sob said, eager to move on before Moteah could press the issue. “Go on, Pyetle, take one o’ me stones and see for yourself.” 
“Actually I was thinking that I want to get some experience myself.” Pyetle said.  “Like you say, learn the quirks. I think I’ll just pick up a stone off the ground, then test it, like you say.”
Sob’s face lit up. At least, the left side of it did. “That’s good! That’s the spirit!” Between his exlamations, Sob’s nose wiggled and WRM.
Pyetle stepped over to the cave wall and pulled a little black shard of rock from it. He chose that particular piece because it stood out from the red sandstone. He thought it was a piece of jet, but it was quite rough to the touch, didn’t catch the light the same way, and it was shaped like a short, fat, carrot, fitting quite comfortably in his palm. 
“Odd choice.” Sob said. “I go for smaller, rounder stones. Easier to accumulate. But before you get to testin’, you need to be makin’ sure your luck is balanced out as best can be. How’s your natural luck? Naked as you came, how unlucky are you?”
“I’d say I’m pretty unlucky.”
“You could be cursed. Are you cursed?”
“How would I know?”
Sob shrugged. “You best be finding out, no? But Hill’s cloak is strong, I’ve seen it in action. It should keep you nice and balanced. Keep in mind, though, it takes time to get a feel fer these kind o’ things. You shouldn’t be expectin’ quick results.”
Pyetle stuffed his new stone into his pocket. Then he pointed at Sob’s pouch of rocks. “What if Ayram wanted those?” he asked.
Sob cocked his ear. “What?”
“Well, they’re not your rocks, right? They’re Ayram’s. You said everything was Ayram’s.”
“What do you mean?”
“You said that everything was Ayram’s,” Pyetle repeated. “ You said that everything is ‘loaned out’. That includes your lucky rocks, right?”
Sob glared at Pyetle.
“Now why would you want to know about that?” he asked.
“I was just wondering. You said that -”
“Now hold on. I want to know what you’re on my lucky rocks fer.”
“I was just wondering if -”
“Don’t be out here wonderin’,” Sob said, cutting Pyetle short. “Wonderin’ about other people and what they’ve got will get you into trouble. So you just worry bout your rocks and I’ll worry bout mine.”
“I warned you not to get him started,” Moteah muttered.
“Get me started?” Sob said in mock offense. “I’m not started. I’m just tryin to keep the man focused on what’s he needs to be focused on, his own damned luck.”
“Alright, alright,” Pyetle said, trying to calm Sob down. “What should I do then. How should I test my new rock.”
“What do you want to do?”
Pyetle thought for a moment. “Well,” he said, “I’d like to get up and out of this cave.”
“That’s not how it works,” Sob said. “You don’t wish-upon-a-stone. You’ve got to use the stone to do somethin’ like -”
But before Sob could finish explaining that the stone’s got to be part of the test, that it’s got to be thrown or stabbed or something, he was interrupted by a bird whistle fluttering down from above. It was a soft little twitter, nothing obnoxious, the kind of thing Pytele would’ve brushed off if Moteah and Sob didn’t look like they’d just heard a divine command. Even when the twittering died down, the two kept their eyes skyward, clearly expecting something more. 
It didn’t take long for Pyetle to put two and two together: this wasn’t some rare desert bird peeking in, tweeting warnings that big mammals were near the nests and holes; it was an Ayramun signal. It had come from one of the scout’s up above, a near perfect imitation of the real thing.
Pyetle looked around at the rest of the Ayramun - they were all awake, alert, and silent. Most had their heads craned upwards like Sob and Moteah. All were clearly expecting another message.
When nothing came, Sob broke the silence.
“You might just get your wish, Pyetle.”
Pyetle was about to ask what he meant, but Moteah shushed him.
Then another tweeted song came floating down. This one, Pyetle recognized.
“That’s a purple starling,” he said under his breath.
Moteah nodded. “An Imperial starling.”
Just as the words were out of her mouth, the cave went abuzz with whispers and ruffled movement. Here and there, Ayramun rushed to roll up their tarps and padded skins. Some simply dropped whatever they were doing and started to climb up and out of the cave. Hill was one of them. He and a few others free-climbed up the wall via series of ledges. Even though they carried bags up with them, strapped to their backs, they kept a clean, steady pace. Pyetle assumed they’d done this hundred’s of times, this particular climb. There were no searching hands or feet, they just floated up the rock-face. Once at the top, they disappeared.
“Well ain’t that interestin’,” Sob said as he finished bundling the clothes that Pyetle wasn’t using. “You’re stone is either the luckiest in the world, or the unluckiest. Might just be cursed.” He looked up at Pyetle with excitement. “Needs more testin’, don’t it.”
“What do you mean?” Pyetle asked.
“What do I mean? Gods man, no wonder you’ve not got a grasp of luck, even when it slaps you in the face.”
“This is just coincidence,” Moteah said. “It’s not like a bunch of Imperials popped into existence as soon as Pyetle wished to get out of this cave. 
“Coincidence?” Sob said. “The man says he wants to get up and out o’ this hole, and next thing comes, and its up and out o’ this hole he’s gettin’. ‘Just a coincidence’, Listen to yerself.”
“Seems like good luck to me,” Pyetle said, smiling.
“Now hold on there.” Sob said. “Might not be good luck. It’s not sunshowers and sugarplumbs drivin’ us out o’ this hole. It’s a herd of Imps marchin’ straight towards us. On horseback no less.”
“Horseback?” Pyetle asked. “You got all that from a tweeting bird?”
“Aye,” Sob said. “The count, too. Roughly fifty of ‘em.”
“This is just a precaution,” Moteah assured Pyetle. “What they’ve spotted up there, some company of Imperials, they’re still a long ways off. They don’t know that we’re here.”
“As may be,” Sob said. “But that don’t mean they ain’t lookin’ for us, ‘cause they’re definitely lookin’ for him!” 
Sob pointed to Mazyd.
“Are they?”
“They’re on horseback. Riding out into the Sand. I’d wager more than money that’s a search party. Only people Imps care about are those damned Seilsi.”
“That’s ridiculous,” Moteah said. “Sand’s too big to search like that. Horses don’t do well out on Charnel Roads.” 
“That’s just the thing. Makes no sense to be out on horses in this heat unless they know exactly where they’re goin’. And what’s out here for them to find? Nothin’ but us!”
Moteah cast a wary eye at Mazyd. She didn’t think it was possible for the Imperials to know where they were, but she’d heard stories about the Seilsi like all the rest. Mazyd didn’t have hands, but there might be some hidden magic
Regardless, she didn’t argue any further with Sob. There wasn’t any time. So, she made to help Sob wrap up his things. 
The sight of Moteah helping Sob was strange to Pyetle. Just moments ago, Moteah looked like she wanted to kill the man any way she could, now, she was gathering up his things - a pipe, a scattered bunch of tresla, sandspit - and putting them into a larger leather sack. Pyetle chalked this kindness up to the urgency of the moment, but he wondered if it wasn’t a sense of kinship driving it.
Most of the others were already finished gathering up their things because they didn’t have much, and what they did have was made to be quickly folded and packed in sacks. These sacks had corded loops for easy hauling, and already some of them were being pulled up and out of the cave with ropes. The rest of the things to be hauled out were being lined up at the foot of the wall. Among them were the tarred leather bags packed with foodstuffs, the waterskins, bundles of bows and arrows wrapped in cotton sheets, and Mazyd, all wrapped up in his new cloak.
When Mazyd’s turn to be hauled up came, the rope was wrapped around his chest and groin. Mazyd’s new leathers took the brunt of the biting rope, but as he ascended up into the air, he would bounce and scrape against the rockface. He couldn’t do anything about it because his arms were tied up against his sides.
Moteah was watching him go up, wincing all the while. When Mazyd was finally, roughly, pulled over the top, and the rope was thrown back down, she told Pyetle he was next.
“Can’t I just climb up it?” Pyetle asked as she started to tie the rope around him. She couldn’t answer because she had to use her mouth to hold one end of the rope steady as she wrapped it around him. Only after she was done, and before she tied him in with a knot, did she entertain Pyetle’s fear.
“You think you can climb this?” she asked. “Do you even know how to climb a rope?”
“You just… climb it, right?”
“No. There’s no time for this. This will be safer, believe me. It’ll be easier. I don’t think you can climb it, anyways.” She then looped the rope around each leg and knotted it tight around shoulder blades. “You’re skinny as hell.” She then gave three tugs on the rope and Pyetle began to rise.
But Pyetle’s weight wasn’t centered on the rope, so as soon as he was hoisted up into the air he started to spin. It wasn’t a violent spin, but it was undignified nonetheless, and it was just enough to prevent him from catching himself against the rock-face with his hands and feet, meaning with each tug upwards he’d bump and scrape against the sandstone, just like Mazyd.
And upwards he went. It didn’t take long because whoever was pulling him was clearly intent on being done with the whole ordeal as soon as possible. When Pyetle’s head finally breached the surface, he found that there were two men pulling him up. Both black as Moteah. One of them was missing an arm, just like Moteah. The other, upon seeing Pyetle’s bald head pop out of the ground, nearly dropped the rope in surprise.
“Oh shit! Gammel, stop! It’s a person!”
“But the Seilsi already up here.”
“It’s the new guy.”
“Oh. Right.”
“You hold steady. I’ll help him up. You got it?”
“He light as air.”
“Yeah. I thought he was a bundle of dried pilk.”
The nearest man, the two armed man, he dropped the rope and stepped over to the lip of the cave where Pyetle hung half-in, half-out.
“Sorry bout the rough pull,” the man said with a deep Zozan lilt. “I thought you were a bundle of dried pilk.”
He then grabbed the part of the rope which was wrapped around Pyetle’s chest, and with one forceful yank, he pulled Pyetle out of the cold shadow of the cave and in into the Sand.
It was still afternoon, so the ground was still hot. Pyetle wanted to just lay there and revel in it, but the Zozan who had pulled him out was already fiddling with the knots that kept Pyetle bound to his rope.
“Roll over,” the Zozan commanded, and Pyetle did. “Oh, and I’m Zouga,” the man said. “You’re Pyetle, right? That there is Gammel.”
Gammel waved. Pyetle noticed that he only had one arm.
Zouga’s deformity was clear as day: his upper lip was cleft in two. It wasn’t nearly as bad as some Pyetle had seen, where the whole upper jaw is cleft in two, but nonetheless, Zouga’s front teeth were permanetly fixed in a grin. Zouga had evidently filed them down to a point, so they stood out from his face like fangs.
“This isn’t a good look, my friend,” Zougaz said.
“What? Is something wrong?” Pyetle asked.
“Not a good look if you can’t pull your own weight, friend. I mean you literally can’t do it. I joke, but really, not a good look.”
“Oh, sorry.”
“I don’t mind. I don’t care. It’s everyone else who gets all pissy. Got to pull your own weight around here.”
“I don’t weigh that much.”
Zougaz laughed as he pulled the tangle of rope out from Pyetle’s tangle of bones. “Right. You don’t. You don’t. Still, what do you do? Some of us have got a little bet going. Gammel’s got you down as a slinger, seeing as we picked you up near Dremmel.”
“A slinger? What? No, I haven’t handled a sling since I was a child.”
Gammel groaned and cursed the dirt. Zouga smiled wide.
“You’re a cook, aren’t you? I bet you know all the herbs from here to Changrala. Last fellow we had who could do up a lizard just right.”
“I’m a terrible cook.”
“Not a cook?” Zouga asked, shoulders slumping. “Why’d Ayram pick you up then?”
“I don’t know.”
Zouga threw the rope back down into the cave, and reassumed his position next to Gammel.
“Everyone here’s got a thing they do,” he said.
“I know beans.”
“You know beans?”
“Well, I know bean-curd.”
“Bean-curd?”
“Bean products, but mostly bean curd.” 
“You not a cook?”
“It’s more the buying and selling of it. Back in Drimmel I would buy kelly-beans in bulk from farmers out in -”
“You a middle-man?” Gammel asked.
“It’s not as simple as that,” Pyetle said defensively. “But...I guess it doesn’t matter. Sure. I’m a middle-man. Not that it matters though. Not many beans out here.”
“Not much buying or selling out here either.,” Zouga said. “It’s more… killing and stealing.”
“He a middle man,” Gammel said. “He as good a thief as any.”
“Hey, I did no work for the Empire,” Pyetle said defensively. “I only provided a service. I didn’t even make a profit. Why do you think I’m here?”
“You a bad thief, then.”
Zouga laughed. “He’ll learn, eh? You can teach him, Gammel. Oh, wait! Stop!”
They stopped hauling the rope.
“What is it?” Gammel asked.
“It’s another person.”
“What?”
“It’s Moteah.”
Pyetle looked towards the big hole in the ground, and sure enough, the top of Moteah’s head was there, bobbing up and down.
Eager to seem useful, Pyetle rushed over to pull her up, but Moteah was already climbing out, so he just knelt there and looked ready-to-help while she mantled the lip of the cave. 
“The hell are you doing, woman?” Gammel asked. “Climb out yourself, like the rest of ‘em. We’ve got things to pull.”
Moteah didn’t respond. Instead she calmly undid the knot of rope around her chest, and then threw the length of it back down into the cave. Then she stood up and dusted herself off, all the while pretending not to notice that she’d pissed Gammel off. This, of course, pissed Gammel off more.
“Woman!” Gammel shouted. “I asked you a question.”
Moteah ignored him. “Alright Pyetle,” she said. “Time to get a move on. Ayram needs to see you. Come on.”
But Gammel wasn’t about to let her leave. He dropped his rope and stomped over to her. 
Zouga shouted after him. “Get your hand back on that rope!”
Gammel stopped in his tracks, clearly torn between lettin’ Moteah have it, and gettin it from Zouga. After a tense moment, he spat, and returned to the rope to continue hauling. There, the only thing he could do to Moteah was stare daggers into her back as she and Pyetle walked away.
“Gammel really doesn’t like you, huh?” Pyetle asked, once they were out of earshot.
“Yeah. He’s my brother.”
“Your brother!? Huh. I can see that.”
“How so?”
“Oh, just the, uh, physical resemblance. Strange that you two are both missing arms. Opposite arms though.”
“It’s because were born joined together. He’s my right arm, and I’m his left.”
“You two were conjoined?”
Moteah nodded. “We were separated after birth. There wasn’t much connecting us, thankfully. I wouldn’t be able to stand it if his mouth was always yapping away right next to my ear.”
“Wow.”
“Yeah. He’s an asshole. I rode the rope up just to annoy him.”
“I never would have guessed. I figured you were just born without an arm. Conjoined twins… I’ve heard of it but never seen it. Is that a common thing with Zozans?”
“I don’t know. It is what it is. ”
“Are you safe from him? He’s got violence in his eyes. No mistaking it.”
“Don’t worry about me. You need to worry bout yourself.”
“You sure? He seemed pretty-”
“Pyetle, really, don’t worry bout me. You need to worry bout yourself. And speaking of - there are things out in the Sand that only Ayram can save you from. He won’t be able to save you if you haven’t taken the oath. Since we’re goin out into the Sand, you need to be taking the oath.”
“What does this oath involve?” Pyetle asked.
“It ain’t too painful.”
“Too painful?”
“It’s a blood oath. There’s gonna to be blood.”
Pyetle grimaced. “What? Why?”
“Look, we’ll kill you if you don’t do it.&quot; 
“Okay…”
“But you shouldn’t take the oath just because you don’t want us to kill you.”
Pyetle laughed.
“What?” Moteah asked. “You got to be doing it for the right reasons.”
“And what reasons are those?”
Moteah shrugged. “It’s different for everyone.”
“Why did you take the oath?”
“That’s between me and Ayram.”
“So I either take the oath, or you kill me. That just doesn’t seem… Well, let’s say I took the oath, but I just said the words without meaning them.”
“There’s no words.”
“Well, ok.... Then suppose I just went through the motions.”
“It ain’t that kind of oath. Maybe oath ain’t the right word. It’s more… I don’t know. It’s hard to describe. It’s more like an experience.” 
Moteah pointed at a hill just down the road. “See that hill with the dead tree right on top of it? There’s a cave in that hill. Pella, the witch, and Ayram will be waitin’ inside. That’s where you make the oath. Don’t make ‘em wait long.” 
“You aren’t coming?”
“It’s your oath,” Moteah said. “I’ve got other things to do.&quot;
Pyetle watched Moteah walk back towards the pit, where the other Ayramun were strapping up for the journey ahead. On the way she stopped, picked up a rock, and rolled it around in her fingers. Pyetle wondered if she was thinking about luck. He wondered if she really thought there was no such thing. As if to give him an answer, she threw rock side-arm over a little mound.
The stone made a funny noise wherever it landed; a kind of delayed echo. It didn’t bother Moteah, but Pyetle was intrigued - there seemed to be another pit. He walked over to check it out, and sure enough, a deep and wide hole opened up into the ground. Another pit cave. No one was in this one, and it didn’t seem to open up into the Underworld. It was just a big hole in the ground, unconnected to anything but the outside air. 
It got Pyetle to wondering just where he was. In the Sand there is a place called the Pitted Portion, a place filled with sinks and holes and caves, but that was a thousand leagues from Dissel, and he couldn’t have made that journey in just one night.
Just to be sure, Pyetle scrambled up a little graveled hill and climbed atop a boulder to get a better view of the place. He expected to see something familiar, like the Blackshell hills or the . The Blackshells were indeed there to the east, but only their peaks, so far away that their white tips barely gleamed through the thick haze of distance. 
The rocky ground all around wasn’t clay, it was rock. Thickly pitted for miles. Most pits weren’t so dramatic as the one he’d come out of, as most edges were sloped and sagged or cratered instead of dropping sheer into the earth. In between these holes there were wide, flat spaces of dry sandstone, but there were also great mounds of boulders and gravel, just like the one he was standing on. Undoubtedly , this was the Pitted Portion. 
No one knew how these pits came to be. There was no river running through it, nothing to carve a winding canyon. It was just like the rest of the Junei plain, only with holes and the rubble that had, presumably, once filled them. Standing there, Pyetle felt certain in Truth of the Solean Myth of Damdromidon - what else but a great demon looking for the buried heart of the earth could explain this cavernous plain?
— When Pyetle had looked at maps to trace the route had taken, he’d come to expect a clear delination between portions. Pitted is here and windy is there. But looking out he wondered if the pitted portion ever ended, if the names given were even useful. If the different parts of the sand were even clear enough to warrant a category, or if it was one big clusterfuck.
Then a voice shouted from the base of his little promontory.
“Pyetle! What are you doing?”
Pyetle turned in fright and saw Ayram standing there, looming large even though he was a good thirty meters away.
“I wanted to take a look,” Pyetle said. “Is this really the Pitted Portion?”
Ayram ignored his question. 
“Did Moteah make it clear to you that there are Imps about, looking for us?” he asked.
Pyetle took a quick look around for any sign of Imperial riders.  “I don’t see any.”
“Do you think that they see you?” Ayram asked.
In his rush to scramble off the boulder, Pyetle fell butt-first onto the slope of the hill. He was able to catch himself, so instead of rolling down the scree, he slid down it. When he got to the bottom, he stood up in front of Ayram and apologized.
“I’m sorry. I was just curious. I’m not used to the whole desert bandit thing. Hiding in holes and whatnot.”
Ayram was watching the cloud of dust that Pyetle had kicked up. It rose slowly into the air, twirling in on itself, measuring both the vortex/convective wind and the magnitude of Pyetle’s shame.
Ayram shook his head.
“Do people find you to be annoying?” he asked.
Pyetle’s jaw would have dropped at the bluntness of the question if it weren’t already drawn tight by embarrassment. As such, Pyetle could barely stammer out a weak, “I don’t know.”
Ayram shook his head. “You need to understand something, so I’m going to state it clearly,” he said. “If you endanger the lives of my people, then you’ll die a death that ravagers dream of.”
Pyetle nodded.
“You nod, but I don’t think you understand,” Ayram said. He was looking down at Pyetle, like a father whose looks to son whose pooped the bed. “The Sand demands a sharp mind. You can be stupid to a point, but you can’t ever be unaware. There’s no shame in getting killed, but killing yourself through carelessness, is that how you want to go?”
“No.”
“Things out here are trying to kill you. Right now. The sun. The Imps. There could be a beatboar a mile away, hogging your scent. Where are they? What are they planning? What can you do about it?”
“I’m sorry.”
Ayram smacked his teeth, like he’d just tasted something foul. “You can make mistakes, Pyetle, but out here the kind of mistakes that require apologies are the ones that get people killed. If you ever need to apologize to me again, be prepared to suffer.”
“I understand.”
“I still don’t think you do. Come. I will make it clear.”
Pyetle followed Ayram around the lip of the pit and back to where Moteah had left him. From there they went to the hill with the cave where he was to take his oath. The entrance to it was narrow, and it matched Pyetle’s height, so Ayram had to duck down and shimmy sideways to get in. Pyetle stopped at the entrance, and tried to see inside.
The interior was lit by a narrow sliver of sunlight that cut down from the entrance and crawled along the floor. It was enough because the cave was small, and the light could bounce around. It was almost like the inside of sandstone ball, with Ayram standing at the far end. To his right, was Pella, hunched and. To left was the witch Elrahet. In between them, cut into the rock floor, was a round hole the width of a foot. 
When Pyetle stepped into the cave, his body cut out the light. Elrahet and Pella each grabbed a wrist, and then Ayram dropped something into the hole.
“How do you feel about the Empire?” Pella asked. Her grip was firm and tight, stronger than Pyetle had expected from a woman of her age.
“I don’t really care about it one way or the other,” Pyetle said. He was sure that Pella had been expecting him to say he hated the Empire. All the other Ayramun seemed to. But something about the scene suggested simple honesty was the best course of action. He felt that something was considering him, sniffing him out. Some sense oustide the normal, which could target truth.
“The Empire kills and it rapes,” Pella replied. “It grinds the wealth and culture of the world to dust. Have you not seen it? Is that not why you are here among us?”
Pyetle was unsure of what to say. His answer would obviously be ‘no’, so he didn’t understand why Pella was pressing the issue. She was trying to catch him out. For what reason, he couldn’t fathom. Maybe she just didn’t like him. 
In the end it was Ayram who answered Pella’s question.
“Pyetle is here because he followed me here. It is as simple as that.”
“No passion, then,” Pella croaked. 
“Remove your shirt.”
Pyetle did.
An odor began to rise out of the hole in the ground. A green glow.
Then Elrahet stabbed in him the belly with a knife.
He doesn’t feel much. Wanted to scream but couldn’t. The words caught in throat, and he couldn’t breath. 
Ayram then reached out, grabbed his shoulder, and threw him him face down to the earth. Pyetle’s belly, and his open wound, was flush over the hole. Then his sense started to dull. He could no longer smell the sulfur. But instead of going dark, his mind began to swim with visions. Flashes of  color, different scenes. The outlines of Ayram’s eyes swirling through them, part of them, edges lost but still there, watching. 
‘Coming to’ moment where ayrams true visage are loaded behind the eyes. Pyetle begins to wonder if Ayram gave him the vision or share in it. If he knew what he was thinking, etc.
After some time, which Pyetle later learned was only a minute, Ayram pulled him up from the ground. When Pyetle searched his belly, he found there was no wound, and that in its place was the brand of the Ayramun.
&quot;Rise my child, Pyetle of the Ayraman. You have been consecrated.”








Oddness with his blood. Indicates that he isn’t commited. -swirls it around a bowl to check the body, the thickness, how many drips fell down the side of the bowl. Elrahet- “His blood is thin but sharp.</Text>

            <Text>Need to describe Drissel, not Jeket here. A world’s geography defines the course of it’s history. What events might not have occurred, what civilizations might history have gained or lost if a valley had instead been a mountain, or an wide inlet instead a barrier island.
 Mankind burrows the earth. Soil erosion like that canyon in georgia. They imported this vine from the empire, called shandri. But it grew unchecked. Swallowed up the plain. 

If an individual wanted their slave to be cruxified, it was a service a crxifiction team could apply for a fee. - tablet detailing the process placed in public square so people would think twice about disobeying masters.

 The smallest twig will accumulate a hump in its lee. It is how the mega dunes began.

There’s two ways to translate the name of the Jandrian city that sits in the middle of the Corning Strait. Kikjeede, when translated literally, becomes Mudwater, but when a Jandri child is warned to ‘stop pestering me or you’ll slip into Mudwater,’ the little brat is being warned about unintended consequences. That’s Mudwater really means - unintended consequences - at least that’s what it means to the Jandrians who know the city’s story. 
  Even the land Mudwater sits on is true to the theme. The long strait that the little port serves, the one which divides two continents, was put there, it is said, as barrier.  For millions of years Jandria was connected at the hip to the Shaldran continent. Then, it is said, Sol threw a fit in just the wrong spot. A fault in the earth opened up and the land was split in two. In one cataclysmic afternoon, Jandria became an island continent and its shoreline was extended by twelve thousand leagues. Valleys which once sheltered wildflowers and all manner of little beasts were reformed by the ocean tides as they roared in. Now, they’re spawning grounds for black-backed trout and shrimp, feeding grounds for sharks and jellies, a pleasure palace for oyster clams and squishy green seagrass. 
It time, of course, men learned how to sail the deep sea - and sailing is so much faster and easier than walking. What was once a barrier to man, became a highway. Men poured west into Jandria, and then trade route developed, running all the way up and down the strait. There was a problem with it though: some peculiar accident of topography, air, and heat conspired to blow a strong southerly wind through the straight. This wind blew in any season. It blew even at night. People said it was the mountains on either side funneling the Ysal winds through. The hard fact was that if you wanted to ship goods north you couldn’t simply tide over. The only way to go was to paddle it. You had to paddle all 12,000 nautical leagues against a gusting wind.
It was done but it was brutal business. Brutal enough that merchant trawlers were forced against custom to keep their oarsmen well-fed and well-drilled so that the rhythm was kept steady, and they had to rest whenever the opportunity came. If too many arms got wrecked with tension, or too many shoulders got blistered with sun-boils, there was the risk that the ship would lose momentum and slide back down south from whence they came. 
The business was so demanding that a necessary rest-stop was set down half-way up the strait. A perfect site was found in a calm inlet on the Jandrian side. It had enough arable land to sustain a bevy of straight-backed young men ready to plow the route, so that a wrecked crew could be swapped out for a fresh one. This was the spot where Mudwater would be founded.
In so many ways, accident and funny circumstance conspired to set up a bustling little port town on the inlet there. It wasn’t called Mudwater back then. In the old Jandrian tongue it was called Windrest, because the men were the northerly wind and that was where they rested. 
That little village was tangible proof that even the Gods can’t avoid unintended consequences. That being the case, you can hardly blame humanity for what came next.
 A young girl was wandering around the foothills on the western side of Windrest. Those hills were pocked with narrow cracks and the girl slipped and fell into one of them. That particular crack wasn’t too dangerous, just ten or so feet deep, but she was too small to climb out. She screamed and cried, and eventually her father found her. When he pulled her out she was clutching something in her little sausage fingers: a nugget of gold.
The father marked the crack with a white stake and went back the next day with a torch. As soon as he landed at the bottom he saw a thick vein of gold - nearly as tall as he -  running through hard dolomite. Within a few months the little village of Windrest became a bustling city, the second largest in all of Jandria.
Mines poured into the hills. This was long before the Empire, long before the word ‘engineer’ had ever been uttered, so there was no notion of how to manage the forces of tension and compression underground. When the people of Windrest dug into the earth they put up wood beams and packed the walls tight with a kind of cement, but that was it. They didn’t understand that the dolomite there was fiercely jointed. The odd cave-in here and there should have served as a warning. To them it was just the cost of doing business.
What’s worse is that these mines weren’t put in with any thought to how they ran up against the water to the east, or up under the weight of the mountains to the west. They only thought about chasing the veins of gold wherever they went - and they went everywhere, even under the now massive city of Windrest. If you were to draw a map of the mines at the peak of the frenzy, it would be easier to outline the negative spaces than to draw the individual tunnels outright. 
All this came to a head when a miner working his way east put a crack in a rock that was holding back the tides of the Strait. Saltwater rushed into the mine, tearing out the wooden supports as it went. It  ripped the cement from the walls and filled up jointing of the dolomite. 
When the bedrock fell, everything else fell with it. 
Windrest included. 
One hundred thousand people were swallowed up by the earth. In those ancient days it was the greatest loss of life that had ever been recorded in a one day.
For a time people called the place cursed. It was only when folks dared to move back in that parables about the unintended consequences that unbridled greed can bring. They named the new city they built Mudwater, as landslides fell into the western back of the newly widened inlet with enough regularity to keep the water muddy until it flowed out and into the strait.
Over the years the landslides grew more infrequent until they stopped altogether. The water had cleared up but the name was stuck. Even if hte old stories werent enough to remind the people who lived there of the folly, every now and then a sinkhole would open up under their feet and remind them.


One of the little girls runs to ‘uncle pyetle’
YOu little brat! Don’t you know I just killed your father?
Look at the poor thing. Can’t be older than four. She’s no idea what’s going on. 
Pyetle kicked her off him.

Bullo comes off as nice guy.
Pyetle like, bullo seems nice moteah
Moteah is like hiss, Bullo’s raped more women and killed more men than small army. Hes a devil.


Theologians and Philosophers still debate the merits of the Hetian case, but common folk, like Pyetle Andramawmun, they don’t care from whence suffering comes, only that it comes too often. When drought hit the pole-bean farms south of Jeket, Pyetle’s business began to fail, and when his wife took a lover, his sanity went with it. He could not console himself with thoughts of happy Hetian villagers. The only thing that could tear his mind from the look on his wife’s face as she pleaded for him to stay was the rainstorm that caught him drunk in the streets of Jeket. 
As he staggered and slipped along the cobbled street of the Sauline Hill, he cursed Sol and all his creation. 
“Damn them all! Damn them, damn them, damn them!”
Sol had conjured this whipping rain just to torment him. What other purpose could there be for a storm so fierce and so far out of season? Too late to revive the bean-crop. Surely, this was a joke of the Gods. 
“This, and this, and this, and this,” he muttered, counting his sufferings. The drink kept his blood warm and his legs moving, though he was not headed anywhere in particular. When he reached the quarried cliff of the great hill, he sat down and let his feet dangle over the edge. From there he could see the city of Jeket in all its splendor.
Eight wide boulevards spread out from the Hill in the eight directions, and they stretched far across the alluvial plain. From these branched roads, and from these branched alleys, all ordered and angled according to the symmetry found in the Solar Fern, the plant which grows all along the banks of the Jade River. Flat and square mud brick tenements sprouted out from these stems, and scurrying amongst them were tiny specks of people. They seemed like blackflies, jumping from leaf to stem to leaf, ducking into boles and cracks, trying to keep dry while they went about their business.
Further out were the massive granite walls which ringed the city. They were distant enough from Pyetle that they seemed small. From there, a patchwork of farms and canals stretched to the banks of the Jade River, then continued on to the horizon. 
High above these distant fields, massive anvil-head thunderstorms lumbered like giants, walking on misty columns of rain. Their hearts rumbled with thunder, and their bodies blocked out the sun. All was grey save for the yellow sliver of sun peeking through, but that was enough to fleck the river, the canals, and flooded fields with gold. Even the rippling puddles at Pyetle’s feet sparkled. 
It was all so fresh and beautiful. 
Beautiful - just not meant for him. Jeket. The world. This beauty - no place in it for Pyetle.
“Fuck it,” he said to himself as the rain beat his back and the cold began to creep in. “It’s not worth it.”
He took the knife that he had just bought out of his pocket, unsheathed it, and cupped it's blade in the palm of his hand. It was an exquisite piece - a thousand specks of tin had been hammered into its cherry hilt, composing a twisting, swirling, wind-like pattern. The blade itself was so finely polished that he could see his reflection in it. He could see how his eyes were red and witless, how his nose was runny, and how his cheeks were sunk and sallow. He looked older than he wanted. Every wrinkle and furrow and sun-spot blemish was an eyesore. He was older than he felt. 
Pyetle stabbed at the puddle with the knife. He had wasted his years of youth and vigor. He had played his hand and had lost. He was beaten by the greedier, cleverer men - them and the Gods.
At that he stood up, turned his back on this privileged vista, set his shoulder against the wind and rain, and made his way to Salavan Saran’s house to kill the friend who had seduced his wife. 
After that, he had only to decide how he wanted to die. The most poetic end would be to wander down one of the thief infested alleys near the Heberdee Gate - one final stab in the back would be fitting.

“Pyetle, my friend! Come in, come in,” said Salavan Saran with a smile. He was a huge man, tall and rotund and wrapped in a yellow silk robe replete with roses embroidered in pink. He beckoned Pyetle past his guards and into his walled compound where his stoop was covered and safe from the rain. “I was beginning to wonder if you were coming,” he said. “Marta and the girls are out, so it’s just us.”
“I hope Marta was able cook a little something before she left,” Pyetle said as he climbed up the white-plaster steps to join Salavan.
“Yes, yes, I told her you were on the way,” Sal said with a chuckle. “She finished a few potstickers before she left, just for you.” 
“Your wife is Divine.”
“Indeed she is. And how is Claire?” 
Pyetle paused and removed his sandals, then stuck his feet out into the rain to wash them of mud. “Well, I took her to the Fordwell the other day,” he said.
 “Ah yes, I recall; you said you two were having some issues. Did your little sojourn through nature have the desired effect?” Sal asked.
“No.”
“I see,” said Sal as he gave Pyetle a practiced but insincere look of concern.
The little man was a pitiful sight, so drenched and drunk as he was. His skinny neck had always seemed like it couldn’t possibly support the bulk of his head, now it seemed to have finally given up. 
“You’re soaking,” Salavan said, “Let me get you a towel and some clothes.”
“No, no, that’s fine, I won’t won’t be long.”
“I insist,” Salavan said. He clapped his hands and a servant boy rushed out with some towels and a simple white tunic. Pyetle followed the boy into a washroom, dried and changed, then came out into the main hall.
As if an honored position on the Sauline Hill were not enough, Salavan’s home was nearly as large and as tall as any other in Jeket, and its opulence was second to none. It had cost Sal three siver-strings of imported lumber just to burn enough lime to make enough plaster to coat the massive walls. The rare paints for the fresco that wrapped around the open-roofed atrium took another fortune more - though it was all worth it, for it was a magnificent work of art, in skill and in subject. It depicted Sol at the very moment of his apotheosis - the sun-god wore a beatific smile, clearly pleased with the sight of his sword as plunged in between his father’s shoulder blades.
“To business then!” Salavan exclaimed as he appeared from behind Pytele. He clapped the little man on the back and waved him up to the second floor, where dinner awaited. As they took the stairs, Salavan tried to prepare Pyetle with some flattering remarks.
“Pyetle, you know I’ve been impressed with how you’ve handled things, considering the circumstances. Lesser men would have blamed someone else. Blamed me, even.”
“Blamed you?”
“Well, you know, I’m the one who first suggested you get into beans all those years ago.”
“That doesn’t matter.”
“Quite right,” Salavan said with confidence. “That’s what I’m talking about. It’s on to the next opportunity.”
 “No, no, no. That’s not why it doesn’t matter.”
 “Oh?”
“It’s Claire.”
“Ah, I see. Business can wait, I suppose.”
“I really thought the Fordwell would rekindle what we had. It really was beautiful. Sol could have descended in a cloud right then and there to give us a blessing. I mean it was a beautiful day.”
“Well, so is today - in it’s own way.” 
The second floor had a high ceiling and high windows that offered a stunning view of the evening sky. By now, the rains had started to move on, and they made room for Sol’s golden light to shift into pink and purple pastels as it played on the city and the clouds all around. 
Common to the fashion of the Solean elite, the furnishings of Salavan’s second story were muted and tasteful so as to pick up Sol’s light. Here the floor was covered in massive rugs that were subtly patterned and white and trimmed with glittering gold ropes. They served as giant picture frames for the colors that Sol threw upon them. There were pillows upon pillows for comfort, with gold tassels and ivory lace threading them together. In one corner the floor had been carved out to accommodate a hefty hotstone. It was heated by the kitchen below and a burning brazier above, and it was already portioned with meats. At the sides of the stone were reclining chairs made of rope strung into angled ebony frames. Pyetle sighed as he reclined into his, then munched on a potsticker that he had pulled from the hotstone. 
Half an hour ago, the rain was cold and overwhelming. Now, it was a cozy and soothing murmur set against the warm light of fire.
“Claire has been the hardest bit for me,” Pyetle said in between bites. “The drought, the losses, the caravans, the thieves, I can handle those. But her… I invested myself into her.”
“You two aren’t separating, are you?”
Pyetle sighed again. “She was cheating on me, Salavan.”
“Oh?”
Pyetle eyed Salavan warily, trying to catch a hint of worry - but Salavan was too shrewd to let anything slip.
“Pyetle, you’re in a tragic spot and I’m sorry for that,” Sal said as he lit up a wrap of freeweed before settling into his chair. “But, I’ve got to be honest - I can’t relate to what you are going through. I’ve heard stories of loves-lost and loves-lorn and I’ve tasted it a little, but, well you know that Marta and I were kids when we were married.”
“I know.”
“So,” Sal said before taking a long drag from his wrap, “I can give you financial and business advice, but what you need right now, I can’t give it to you.”
Pyetle bit into another potsticker, and he savored the sweet peach sauce in which the shredded chicken had been baked.
“This is so good,” he said. “If only I could steal Marta from you.”
“You are certainly welcome to try,” Sal said, smiling.
“I suppose I would fail.” Pyetle moaned. “At this point, I would have to pay for it if I wanted intimacy.” 
“Pyetle...”
“It’s this face. This damned body. Like my father’s - I don’t understand how he ever got a woman to stick with him.”
“Claire’s not that shallow. Besides, your father was richer than I am.”
“It doesn’t matter. It doesn’t matter,“ Pyetle asserted, eager not to be distracted from his task. 
Sal took another drag from his wrap before continuing on to his point. “Just settle for a woman that will have you for your money. You’ve not got much of it left, but any little bit of money has a way of motivating a person to look deeper into a Being. First she’ll have you for your money, and I trust, in time, she’ll have you for you. The more money you make, the closer she’ll get.” 
“I’ve been married to Claire for 13 years, Sal. If that wasn’t long enough to… are you saying I should move on already?”
Sal leaned back in his ornamented chair and folded his hands across his stomach. “You’ve spent your whole life getting what you want in the way that you want it, Pyetle, except this one thing. You’re spoiled - no, that’s not fair - You’re stubborn. Women of consequence, women like Claire, they pick up on that as soon as you open your mouth. No one wants to be stuck with a stubborn ass for a lifetime.”
“I guess so.”
Pyetle’s flippancy was disturbing. Sal looked down his nose at the broken man, and in the flickering firelight he caught the glimmer of tears streaking down Pyetle’s face. Sal looked away in disgust, and caught sight of the horizon. There, Sol’s light was dimming, the rain was letting up, and through it he could make out the evening song of Swassel birds drifting in on a cool breeze. The mood would have been delightful if it weren’t for Pyetle’s sorrow clouding the room.
“Have some freeweed,” Sal demanded.
“No.”
“Pyetle, I may not know the depths of your sadness -” Salavan said with a sarcastic bite, “but I’ve had my share of sadness in general, and a wrap of freeweed blunts its edge. It’s the only thing I can offer you. Take it.”
Pyetle wiped his eyes with the palm of his hand and tried to compose himself before taking a wrap from the tray near him. He then stood up to light it in the fire that burned above the hotstone.
 “I think this is it for me,” Pyetle said as he rolled the tip of the wrap in the flame. “I’m done. I’m finally done with it all. I’m going to do it.”
“What do you mean?” Sal asked.
“You’re going to make me say it?”
“Say what?”
Pyetle simply smiled, turned his chair to face Salavan, and sat back down to nurse his freeweed and glare at Salavan.
“Well, I’m sure you’ve considered all alternatives. I don’t need to remind you that in the eyes of the Gods killing yourself is the same as killing any other.”
“Alternatives...”
“Did you ever get to hear old Pella Germin preach?”
“I don’t go in for that.”
“I heard her preach once. She said that we are expected to kill ourselves.”
“Did she?”
“She said something like, ‘Corruption is a stain that does not wash off. To be free of it, to achieve peace, you must first kill yourself.’”
“You were there when she preached this?”
“I was. For a while I marked it as the ravings of a Dreamer, especially considering what came of her. But, in time, I saw some wisdom in it. Perhaps I put the wisdom there, but it felt like I found it. So tell me, have you tried killing yourself? Figuratively, I mean.”
“I don’t know what that means.”
“It means, try living for a little bit as if Pyetle Andramawmun were dead.”
“That’s a bit heretical, isn’t it?”
“No, no, no. Follow me here. From this moment on, Pyetle is dead, and residing inside this fleshy vessel is whoever you want to put in there.”
“If it were possible... Well, what? I should just pretend I’m not me? I don’t think it works that way.”
 Sal leaned forward. The freeweed was working its energy into him. “Your broken heart is there because you put it there. Pyetle put it there. If you kill Pyetle, he can no longer stop you from throwing away his treasure.”
“I put it there?”
 “Yes! You must see that.”
“I should blame myself for what other people have done to me?”
 “You take no responsibility?”
 “I’d sooner blame you, Sal.”
 “Me?”
“What? You didn’t think I’d find out?”
“What are you talking about?”
“Salavan, I saw you two fucking.”
The accusation fell like a hammer blow, it flattened out the mood and stunned Salavan into silence. He narrowed his eyes, sat back in his chair, and glared at Pyetle while the moment passed between them. Only when it was good and gone did he grunt and snarl and huff and say , “I see.”
 Pyetle leapt up out of his chair, his face flushed and his limbs tight with purpose. He reached into his tunic for his knife.
It wasn’t there.
He had left it with his wet clothes downstairs. 
“You’re so god-damned stupid,” Salavan said, “You’re looking for this?” 
He took Pyetle’s knife out of his own pocket.
“You know I was wondering about this - I know you’re one of those loony Dreamer types who never travel armed, and so I wondered… but I thought you were just going to kill yourself. But my! How could I forget - you’re an ambitious man!”
He stood up. The great bulk of him dwarfed Pyetle. 
Pyetle’s knees almost buckled. 
“You know, I’m impressed,” Salavan continued. “Perhaps now you realize the strength of your own Will. No doubt at some point in your miserable life you’ve tasted it - the thought of something you could do, something you wanted to do, but wouldn’t dare, because what kind of a man would do such a thing? And now here you are! Doing it! Well, you tried to. It’s the attempt I admire.” He took a step forward. “But here, let me show you how it’s done.” 
Pyetle turned to run, but Salavan kicked out at his feet. It was enough to knock a drunken Pyetle to the carpet. 
Salavan pounced.
 “Hold still, Pyetle! Hold still!”
“Stop! Help!”
Salavan used his great strength to wrestle Pyetle’s flailing limbs into submission, and used his weight to squeeze the air from Pyetle’s lungs. He delighted in the pitiful sound that Pyetle made as he wheezed. 
 “Did you ever dream of committing murder?” Salavan asked. He put the knife up against Pyetle’s throat. “You chew on your Will in your dreams and here you’ve tried to let it out, but it’s gotten stuck, and what’s this? It’s welling up in your throat.” Salavan peered into Pyetle’s gasping mouth. “Yes, I can see it!” Salavan exclaimed with glee. “Hah! I can see it there inside of you now! The way everything is squirming in there.” He set the knife’s blunt edge against Pyetle’s tongue and pressed down. “Yes! Gods, you really fucked this up Pyetle. When you pass on into the Hell, that should be your final thought, that this is all your fault.”
Tears streamed down Pyetle’s face and his lungs burned in agony. Salavan paused his ramblings to delight in the picture. 
“There’s no greater feeling,” he muttered.
As Pyetle’s vision started to blur, he thought he could see something at the window - a shadow of a figure. It pulled itself up and into the room. It was shrouded and skinny and tall, absolutely massive, nearly the height of the ceiling. 
Pyetle thought that Death incarnate had come. His time was at an end.
Salavan screamed.
“EAAAUUUGHHH!” 
The knife fell from Pyetle’s mouth and Salavan tumbled off him to the floor.
Pyetle coughed and spat and wriggled up against the wall. When his vision cleared he saw that Salavan’s arm was struck with an arrow. At the window was a man, a giant man, taller than even Salavan by at least a foot. At his side was a massive bow. He knocked another arrow.
“Thief! Brigand!” Salavan yelled, clutching at his pierced arm. He scrambled to his feet and ran towards the stairs, but he stopped when he saw that it was blocked by another hooded figure. 
“Hill!?” 
A short, squat man all wrapped in black ascended the stairs. He held a scimitar in his hand, and pointed it towards Salavan’s fat belly. 
“Hill, what are you doing here?” Salavan asked.
“You know why. No games,” Hill said. His speech was thick with a southern Jandrian lilt.
“Take what you will and be gone!” Salavan shouted, but Hill ignored him. Instead, he pointed with his sword to the giant at the window.
“Do you know who is he?” 
Salavan twisted round. He had never seen a man as broad or as tall, but he had heard stories. This could only be the famous Giant of the Junei. “You’re Ayram.”
“Yes, he is Ayram.” Hill walked round to where Ayram stood. He gave quick glance to Pyetle, who sat frozen on a heap of pillows. “Ayram is boss, and you make me look bad.” Hill poked Salavan in the stomach with his sword and then cut the knot which held Salavan’s robe together. It fell apart to reveal a large, hairy belly.
“What are you talking about? 
“Ayram trust me, I trust you, you betray me, it look like I betray Ayram.”
“Betray you?”
“No games.”
“Dammit Hill! At least tell me what you think I did.” He turned to plead with Ayram. “Ayram, Ayram whatever this cretin told you about me -”
Hill lashed out with his sword-arm and cut Salavan’s belly. It wasn’t deep, but the speed and shock of it put Salavan off balance.
“You little demon!” he roared. 
Hill just tut-tutted and shook his head.
“You no talk to Ayram,” he said. “You deal with me. You broke my trust.”
“Whatever you think it is that I did - I didn’t.”
“Fine. We play game.” Hill lashed out again and cut an X into Salavan’s belly.
“STOP! Hill! Just tell me what the Hell is going on!”
“You give me bad information. I give it to Ayram. My friends die. You deny this?”
“What? You think I set you up?”
“You didn’t?”
Salavan shook his head. “Hill, you fucking idiot. Why the Hell would I do that?”
“That is why we be here. To find out.”
“Hill… Ayram... You people are more valuable to me than anything. I would never betray you or whatever it is you think. Go ahead! Take whatever you want. There’s no need for this.”
Hill took a step towards Ayram. His face passed into deadly seriousness.
“The call on that caravan - where you get it?”
“I’m the exchequer for the mining guild. I have access to all of the -”
“That wasn’t a mining column.”
“Yes it was.”
“That was Imperial cavalry.”
“Imperial cavalry? I pointed you towards a Sheldri company caravan. Seventy-two hands. Five wagons. ”
“Seventy two, yes. Five, yes. But one Seilsi. You left that out.”
“What?”
“There was a Seilsi.”
Salavan stumbled over his next words. “A - a Seilsi? What would a Seilsi be doing with -”
“Stop.”
“I have no -”
“I say stop.”
“But I have no -”
Hill plunged his sword into Salavan’s thigh. Salavan doubled over then crumpled down to the ground. His blood dripped on to the carpet, and it spread out over the intricate gold patten and soaked deep into the white fibers. 
“Please! Please!”
Hill pulled out his sword and slapped Salavan’s side with it.
“You a big man, Sal.” Hill said. “Ayram, how many he can take?”
Ayram stood still, towering over the scene, stroking his beard with his fingers. He did not respond.
Hill tilted his head from side to side as he appraised Salavan’s great bulk, then he poked it with his finger to test its firmness.
“Very fat. I can cut it all off if you like?”
“Hill…”
“Yes?”
“Let me do some asking. If what you say is true -”
“You doubt the Truth?”
“No! No. Just let me do some asking. I was set up, same as you.”
“You really not know?”
“I didn’t! I swear to the Gods I didn’t!”
Hill looked at Ayram. He nodded.
Hill lifted his sword above Salavan’s head.
“Wait,” Ayram said. “Let the little man do it.”
All three of them looked at Pyetle. 
“Pyetle, right?” 
Pyetle nodded.
Ayram walked over and picked up Pyetle’s knife. He stood close enough that Pyetle, looking up, could see his face. The brazier’s fire lit it up from underneath so that his sunken cheeks cast shadows over his eyes. Pyetle could feel his glare digging into him, digging right through his own eyes and into his mind, into his soul, even. 
“Do what you came here to do,” Ayram said. He held out Pyetle’s knife. It seemed like a toothpick in his massive, calloused palm.
“I’m… I’m not…”
Ayram smiled. “Don’t worry, don’t worry. I heard the whole thing. You’re a man after my own heart, Pyetle. He deserves it. Let me help you.”
He reached down and grabbed Pyetle’s upper-arm then lifted him up like a child and set him onto his feet. His tight grip seemed so rigged with strength and vigor that Pyetle thought he might snap the bone with an easy squeeze - but Ayram wasn’t rough. With a paternal touch he guided Pyetle along to where Salavan knelt, and then placed the knife in Pyetle’s hand. 
“Go on.” 
Salavan cowered in the flickering firelight, bleeding all over, eyes stuck wide with fear. His heavy breathing was the loudest thing in the room. Pyetle no longer saw him as a man, as an enemy, but an animal - just meat and bone and terror. He expected Salavan to plead for mercy. He even hesitated to wait for it. When it didn’t come he almost asked Salavan if he wanted it, and in his excited mood he might have given it, but his lips quivered and sank and he put the knife up to Salavan’s throat. 
“A last thought, Salavan?”
Sweat beaded down the sides of Salavan’s face. He glanced round the room - over to Hill, up to Ayram, and when his eyes settled at last on Pyetle he furrowed his brow and opened his mouth to speak, but before he could get out a word Pyetle split his throat.
Salavan fell forward, face down into the carpet. He gargled and gasped, one arm clutching his throat, one pulling on Pyetle’s tunic. Pyetle tried to swipe it away, but Salavan’s grip was still strong. As Pyetle staggered back he dragged Salavan along so that his body painted a bloody swath across the rug. Finally, Pyetle slashed at Salavan’s arm with his knife and that was enough to get rid of it.
In a few moments, after a few spasms, Salavan was dead.  His sprawling corpse and in his pooling blood was neatly framed by the rectangle of the rug’s golden trim. His head was even placed on a perfect third, drawing the eye. It was as if Sol had composed the canvas himself so that His twilight could play over the gruesome scene with the firelight, affirming to all who were present His majesty, His Will, .
Salavan, at least, had come to a poetic end.

“Somebody’s coming.”
Ayram bounded over to the window and drew his bow.
“The wife.”
“Hold it!” Pyetle yelled. “Hold it!”
Both Hill and Ayram looked back at Pyetle for an explanation.
“She’s done nothing wrong!”
“Nothing you know,” said Hill.
“She doesn’t deserve to die,” Pyetle pleaded.
“Deserved to be made a widow, though?” Ayram asked.
Pyetle looked down at his feet. Ayram laughed and loosened his draw. “No worries, my little drunk man. No worries. Come, let us depart.” 
Hill jumped out of the window and into evening sky. Ayram tossed Pyetle down after him, then leapt along beside. The each scurried into the shadow of the wall. Hill moved like mouse, and Ayram seemed to be shadow himself. Pyetle stumbled along and nearly gave them away as Salavan’s wife, Marta, and her two girls made their way up the stoop.
The two brigands circled around behind and out the gate, and Pyetle followed along as best he could. Twice, out in the street, he lost track of them. Drunk as he was it wasn’t hard, but even sober it would have been difficult; Hill and Ayram were nearly as one with shadow and the shadows grew long as the sun had begun to set. When Ayram doubled back the second time he took a hold of Pyetle’s wrist and did not let go again for the rest of the journey through Jeket’s streets and alleys. 
Pyetle was content to be led. He only needed to keep his feet moving. He didn’t want to work. He didn’t want to think. He wanted only to cry and to be done with it. When at last they came to a stop inside of a secluded shrine to the Dreamer, he collapsed to his knees and begged to left alone. When Hill opened the door to a little crypt behind the Dreamer’s eye, Ayram picked Pyetle up and carried him under his arm. 
Hill lit a torch. Inside the shrine there were three plain stone sarcophagi. Hill kicked the lid of the center one open. Pyetle peered into and was surprised to see that there wasn’t a mummified corpse, there was a hole. 
“What is that?” he asked.
“The way out.” Hill said.
“Where does it lead?” 
“It be the Underworld?”
“The Underworld?” Pyetle asked in a frightened whisper. “Here? A passage down is here?”
“They’re everywhere,” Ayram said. “You just have to know where to look.”
At that he tossed Pyetle down into the hole, then dived in after him.


 Ayram interrogating Salaman,
&quot;I’m trying to figure out why you told me it was gold out there. You know what I’m trying to do out here. You know I’d jump at the chance to take out a Mazydei. So when I was knocked out by his blast of power, you know what I was dreaming about for two days? Why would Salavan lie to me about it? Why tip me off to a shipment of gold that isn’t there, and instead lead me into the lion’s den?”
“It doesn’t matter,” Salavan said, fawning. “You’re here, you killed him! It’s all good! Good!”
“I can only think of two reasons why you’d set me up.”
“Set you up? No! No. Set up the Imperial scum, sure. Not you.”
“But you could have told me. I might not have lost thirty Ayramun that way.”
“Thirty Ayramun? Forgive me, Ayram. Forgive for saying, with all due respect, that thirty Ayramun is a small price to pay for killing one of the nine, no?”
Ayram gets real close, as if to show by his sheer size that he wasn’t afraid of anything. The mere suggestion that Salavan was up to things Ayram wasn’t was an inslut.
“They were Ayramun, Salavan. They were me. You’ve a blood debt to pay.”
Ayram motions to Hill, who gave shrill whistle. Then Salavan’s family came marching up the stairs.
Horror in their faces.
“Tell me why you set me up. You figured the Mazydei would kill me?”
“Kill you? Nonsense. Impossible.”
“What was it then? Why not just tell me I was up against a Mazydei. You wanted to make sure I killed the beast instead of taking him captive? I think you know they’re worth more to me alive than dead. That’s the only other thing that makes sense here - that he knew something about something and you didn’t want to risk it getting to me.”
“Take a Mazydei captive? Nonsense. They’re too powerful to be -“
Salavan’s words were cut short by a knife to the neck.
“I’m only going to ask you this once: What’s going on that you don’t want me to know about?”
Salavan glances down at the blade.
“Oh, this knife here, not going kill you with it. See there’s a knife just like it up against your wife’s neck. Just want you to feel the edge like she’s feeling it. Same shock of fear. Maybe it will sober you up and come clean.”
“You’re… You’re going to kill her anyways.”
“Yes, but Salavan… because of your lifestyle,” and he stressed the word ‘lifestyle’ as his eyes cast about the room with a disapproving glare, “I don’t expect you to really feel the weight of what I’m about to say, but not all deaths are the same.” 
Ayram could read the confusion writtin on Salavan face, his gibbering lips.
“I’ve seen people die in seconds. I’ve seen people suffer years of torment. And it’s not just a matter of time. I’ve seen people suffer years in seconds.”

            <Text>
	The Sand is webbed by a network of byways that are hardly there at all. They’re not well traveled, and most are so windswept that footprints get filled back up with sand as soon as they’ve been made. These roads are only distinguished from the desert landscape by a series of five-ton waystones that stick up three meters out of the ground. If those gleaming white beams of rock weren’t there every league or so, you’d never know that under your feet was an ancient Jandrian route. 
	Pilgrims call them Charnel Roads because unlike the highways which keep to the river banks or hop between oases, these roads cut through the vast shadeless expanse of the Sand. Travelers get exposed to the sun, the wind, and the glare of the desert. The longer the road the deadlier it all is, though that’s just a rule of thumb because the worst Charnel Road, the Bazul Road, is one of the shortest. It sits just north of Uncharted Portion where an ancient mountain range once stood. An eon of blasting sand had reduced those mountains to a rolling line of graveled hills, flat enough for the Bazul Road to snake up and down them, and to lead pilgrims to the greater shrine of Bazul. It only takes a full day to make the road if you start at the nearest Imperial outpost at Shahiz, but its such a difficult hike, and Pilgrims sweat so much from just the effort that the heat on top of it is unbearable. And it’s a saturating heat, too, because the chalky gravel underfoot is white as bone so it throws the sunlight right back up into the face. You get baked from below as much as from above. Can’t even hide in your own shadow.
 	There is some shade on route: a little wood-frame waystation at a saddlepoint. The monks of Bazul keep it stocked with a cache of water buried in jugs. Some pilgrims sleep there in the day and make the road at night, skipping the sun altogether, but Solitant pilgrims don’t use it. They don’t trivialize the journey. They set out for the shrine in the morning and trudge through the brunt of it at midday. They do it, they say, because if Bazul did not intend for them to suffer, he would have set his earthly dwelling down on some oated knoll at the mouth of a Jeketian inlet. No, Bazul’s road was there in the Sand because Bazul put it there, and to skip this test of faith against flesh is to have no faith at all. This is the first lesson the road teaches the Solitant: the greatest temptation one must fight is the temptation to not try at all.
	Once a pilgrim actually gets on the road the temptations start to give way to the struggle. There are still a few urges to deal with, a few spiritual lessons learn. For example, there’s urge to stop and sit, to rest. Anywhere else in the world it would be a fine thing to do, but sitting down on a Charnel Road without shade is a mistake because the sun still bakes you even if you’re not moving. It will bake you tomorrow, too, so don’t saddle tomorrow’s self with today’s journey.
	Solitants savor this particular ordeal because it highlights two important lessons: doom finds you much quicker than death, and doing nothing is the same as doing the wrong thing. Nowhere else in the world are these principles so clear. Out on a Charnel Road, a man, sitting down, with no aches or pains and a full waterskin, is still moving towards the point of no return. This is the the inescapable consequence of Time: inaction is action itself, and for the Solitant, it is a refusal of the Divine gift of Will. 
	It is important to note that the Solitant word for doomed is ‘Shiskason’, and it doesn’t mean ‘doomed’ exactly. Unlike ‘doomed’ it carries an air of blame, not fate. It reads roughly like, ‘thing-that-you-did-not-prevent’. This gets to the heart of the Solitant religion: all creatures are naturally immortal, but every creature dies because every uncouth mistake ages the soul, every missed opportunity for righteousness draws another line in the face. If only people made the right decisions at every step they would live forever, but we’re all too ignorant, too dumb, and too lazy, so the weight of our failures literally kill us. Here, a pilgrim becomes a Shiska for no other reason than he stopped and he sat and he did not walk the road.
	 This cosmology is woven into the Solitant’s yellow haircloth habit. The constant itch is a constant reminder to never waste time. It keeps one alert and attentive to even the smallest opportunity to exercise Will. Of course, this creates another temptation pilgrims must fight on the Charnel Roads: the temptation to cast the scratchy habit aside. Not only does it itch, but the heat gets underneath it. The urge to take it off, to get the heat out and let the sweaty skin breathe is ever present. It’s here that the body starts to bargain with the mind, “Just take it off for a little while,” it pleads. “No one is watching. No one would know.” Pilgrims don’t ever do it, though. It’s a familiar temptation. Not only would they be casting aside their symbol of devotion, they’d actually be making it easer for the sun to sap their bodies of moisture and energy. 
	Its not the temptations, its the physical struggle that does most pilgrims in. On the Bazul road a twisted ankle or a tweaked knee is all but inevitable. Man’s upright gait just isn’t designed for a sustained trudge uphill through loosely packed gravel. No pilgrim has ever made the journey without stumbling a time or two, and when they fall their hands and feet get cut because the gravel isn’t smooth like riverstone, it’s been chipped unevenly by the wind and the sand. It’s got points and edges, some as sharp as blades.
	Solitant monks are used to fighting through physical pain, but nonetheless, it slows them down and gives the sun time to work delirium into them. At that point if they make a mistake with water, they’re dead, and it’s an easy mistake to make for any Solitants that come from across the northern sea. They don’t know what the sun can do to a body with just a few hours. When these foreigners come to the Bazul Road, all they hear is that its only a days journey. One day’s journey. Only twenty leagues. Sure, they hear stories about the deaths, but they shrug them off because such stories are never accurate. Carnage is always embellished. Three water-skins should be enough. 
	It’s hard to get experience traveling in the Sand, because getting experience means you’ve got to survive your mistakes. The first time a person pricks her water-skin on the half-buried thorn of a karkel-bush seed pod is the last time. There’s just no room for error, and dying in the Sand isn’t a pleasant way to go. If the heat takes you quick its not so bad, but if it doesn’t, if you’ve rationed water well enough to die slowly, then your mouth dries out and your tongue swells up and your eyes lose their moisture and start to scratch. Then a thumping nausea works its way out from your head and into your stomach and then into your marrow’s jelly. It’s no coincidence that almost every corpse found on a Charnel Road is found curled up like fetus against the agony, though not many corpses are found because a pack of lizards can eat a full adult male in a just few hands, and when you’re dying of thirst, weak as a babe, you might still be alive when they do it.

Shade giving trees  they don’t like. Kills them. Fall asleep under it and you don’t wake up. They think they’re killers. We keep them up because they keep scandri away. 
“They aren’t coming. Too many kekle trees.”
“What’s wrong with kackle trees?”
“They’re shade giving trees. They’re afraid them.”
“Trees don’t have souls. Trees aren’t even living things.”
Dan gives Ralph a look.
“If you call it life,” Ralph continued, “it’s gotta be killing something, doesn’t it? Anything can die. I can crush a rock with my hammer and I can crush a bug with my hammer, yet we say the rock is a thing and the bug is a life. Why? Because the bug kills other bugs. That’s how you know they’re alive. It’s the killing and the eating.” That last word rolled through Ralph’s beard like a saw.
“What about children?”
“Trees eat children?”
“Fuck, no… Definition of life. Bugs have children, rocks don’t. That’s what makes a bug alive.”
“Cut a man’s balls off, what is he then? Dead? Just because he can’t have children?”
“He’s of a type that has children.”
Ralph just shrugged. “I say it’s killing. If these trees are alive, then that means they’re killing something. Could be it’s us. I heard once that we’re supposed to be immortal, and that the trees are poisoning the air to age us, so they can feast on our corpses when we die. We think we’re tending the orchard field but it’s really the orchard field tending to us!”
“Where the hell did you hear that?”
“From some pacified herd in the south. They’re mostly dead now. Dog worshippers the were. Fed their dead to packs of dogs to keep them out of the ground. Ground the bones to dust then tossed in with the water the dogs lapped up. Then they made bricks out of the feces.”
“No wonder you’re all …” Loopey
“You’ve always said I should contemplate more, so I’ve been contemplating. What do you think Eliza?”
“Living things can grow. Everything else can only waste away.”



You’ve won not when you can stab your opponent in the belly, you’ve won if you can bring your blade to a narrower angle than the opponent. Because that means you’ve got a quicker path to the belly. 
So, let’s just stand here , sword to sword. 
Pytele copies the pose
So here, we’re even. Now if I pull my sword to swing, you’re winning. One step and stab and I’m dead. If I take a step back, and out of your range, it doesn’t matter. This is the first beginner lesson: you start the swing out of range, finish it in range. If you’re going to give the opponent the angle advantage, then stay out of range. Like so
Alright, back to the the start. One way of gaining advantage might be to simply knock the opponents sword, like so:
My sword’s on the line, yours isn’t, so I’ve won. But theres an easy counter, I’m sure you can think of it. Yes, you can simply move the sword out of the way, but you’re moving the sword off the line. You’re giving it up without me hitting it. 
A practiced swordsman will know all the moves, all the tricks and traps. So if you run into one, your best bet is to simply maintain a safe distance. You should run, if the mood calls for it.
How do I know if my opponent is skilled?
Oh, you’ll know in an instant whether or not your opponent knows about the line, about distance. The number of men I’ve killed with their sword out to the side like this, mid swing, its absurd. It’s like they’ve got this thought that if they start their swing first, that means I’ve got to parry it. It doesn’t enter their minds that I could just take a step forward, close the distance myself, and then stab them.

But if enemy know about distance, about the line, you should probably run. Everyone else, the mere fact that you’re considering it means your much more likely to win. And this is the thing about fighting - about everything really - it’s more about knowledge and experience than your god-given physical tools. I’m one of the smallest in the Ayramun, but no one here would fight me.

I would - mazyd says.

You would? You haven’ t got hands.

If I had hands, I would have fought you.

That’s surprising. I thought your lot just zapped people to death. What’d you learn swordplay for?



Strength, agility, these only come into play in bouts of similar skill.



- They’re out in the Sand - passing along gravellands 
- Pyetle decides to help out Mazyd.
- What happened in that cave?
- Mandrameen gets a hold of Pyetle. Inquires into his past life. Inquires into the time he met Ayram. Reveals they were all similarly distressed when Ayram picked them up.
- Pyetle asks about who Ayram is. What’s his deal? I had an experience.
- He’s going to throw the Empire out of the continent.
- I mean what’s his real deal? IN the underworld there was, for a moment I thought he was  demon. I saw things.
- A powerful being, but no, but not a demon.
- Asked Seilsi for his story. ???
- Interrupted by scout - Imperials are on the track - still really far away.
- How the hell! (It’s Mazyd) - we’ve been careful, we’re off the road.
- Double pace to Minting Rock
- “Ah, there it is” - outcrop of rock. Band’s secret minting facility.
- Signs that someone’s been here.
- Hill checks it out. Laughing. Says come on in.
-They stumble on a dried out corpse of a man. It’s an old friar. Must have gotten lost on the Charnel Road or something.
- Relsa, “He’s alive!” “What did he say?” Begone temptress.
- they revive him. See he’s a priest of the dreamer. Pella explains. I was once a priestess. Didn’t know this dude though.
- Hill shows pyetle gold store. Good amount of gold. “Not much of it left”. They put it on the horses and take it away, Pyetle knows not where.
- Pick up water from spring nearby.
- Pella scope sees troops. Mazyd confirms that they’re imperial - they’ve just gotten down into the plain.
-COming right for the rock - interrogate Mazyd - tie up, blindfold, wind, etc. 
- need to change course - lose them in the Sandslants

Pyetle looked behind them, and say that Mazyd was struggling along. “What about Mazyd?” he asked.
 “The Seilsi?”
“Yeah.”
“What about him?”
“Well, Urghiz is a long way off.

“Yeah.”
 “He’s in pretty bad shape. You think he’s going to make it?”
“Shit, I don’t know if you gonna to make it.” Moteah looked Pyetle up and down, clearly unimpressed with his fitness. “You don’t know how bad it is out there. It’s not just the heat.”
“I’ve been on caravans.”
“We ain’t keep to the roads.”
“Well if you’re concerned about me, then how is he gonna make it?” Pyetle asked, nodding in Mazyd’s direction. Moteah stopped him, and looked in his eyes with intent.
“Pye, I’m tryin to get you worryin about yourself. Ya need to be. Let us worry bout him. For you, for now, it needs to be one step at a time. It needs to be that way for a while. Shits about to get real.”
Pyetle looked back again at Mazyd and wondered if the beaten man could hear their conversation. Mazyd was far enough down the face of the dune that if he were just another human, it would be impossible, but he was a Seilsi, and there was no telling what he was capable of. There were rumors that Seilsi had strange biologies, but these rumors always conflicted, so Pyetle never gave them credence. One day a man would claim he saw a Seilsi jump over a crowd just because he could, while another would say he saw a Seilsi struggle to get up into a saddle. Some said they could see through walls, others said they were nearly blind.
There was a lot unusual about Mazyd’s appearance - the hairlessness, the androgyny - but there was nothing that suggested unnatural ability. There were the strange tattoos, and perhaps they were working some magic into his veins, but Pytele doubted it. Mazyd just looked too helpless. No one infused with a magical force would drag their feet in the sand. No one who could see through walls could be ambushed and captured.
Mayzd stumbled as he trudged up dune. His left leg buckled, and the weight of him As he fell he did enough to keep the bandages out of the sand, but his hip hit a rock and he . The two guys minding him moaned and cursed and yelled at him to get back up. Moteah looked on in disgust. She despised Mazyd. They all did, save Pyetle. 
“I could help with the Seilsi,” Pyetle suggested.
“Pye, what did I just say. Worry about yourself.”
“I am worrying about myself. I’m thinking about how I fit in. It seems like none of you want to deal with the Seilsi - well that’s something I could do.” 
Moteah rolled her eyes. “I’ll ask Pella about it.” She turned back to the course and trudged along. “Come on, we almost there.” 

 

, he came at last upon a rocky mountain with a large cave at the foot of it and a large stone over the entrance. After removing the stone and going in, eager to explore the unknown with a human curiosity, he found a spacious chamber, with an opening to the sky above covered over by spreading branches of an ancient palm tree. There was a sparkling spring there, from which a stream overflowed through a little opening, and soaked away into the earth. There were also a few little buildings near the foot of the mountain containing the knives and anvils and mallets used to strike coins; Egyptian writings tell us that this used to be the site of a secret minting factory at the time when Antony and Cleopatra were together.

Pyetle took Mandrameen’s outstretched hand and the boy helped him up. Pyetle was surprised to feel a sinewy strength in the lad; he was a bit scrawny and had a bookish look about him, with a weak chin and a scholar’s neck. He’d seen the Mandrameen ruffling through some papers earlier. He’d assumed the boy was something of a camp follower, but this close he noticed the boy’s belt was actually a corded Jandrian sling, patterned for war. Mandrameen’s firm grip suggested expertise.

They ordered another young man in the flower of his youth to be taken into a most pleasant little garden, with white lilies and red roses, and a gentle murmuring stream winding through it, and the wind making a sweet whisper though the leaves of the trees, where they made him lie down on a feather bed, and left him there, tied down with soft silken bonds to prevent him escaping. After they had all gone a beautiful prostitute came in, and began stroking his body in the most delicate of embraces, and, shameful to relate, fondling his manhood in her hands, in the hope of so inciting him to lust that she might win a shameless victory over him. I don't know how this soldier of Christ did it, or how he summoned up his resolve. But will pleasure be the victor where torments fail? For at length, inspired by heaven, he bit off his tongue and spat it in her face as she tried to kiss him. And so the immense pain which followed was stronger than the feeling of lust.

Is he dead?
No pulse.
He’s never had a pulse.
Sob wants to kill Mazyd 
Mandri steps in the way.
Sob accuses Mandri of being turncoat.
“Ayram has already said what is to be done with the Seilsi. Killing him ain’t it.”
“Ayram is dead for all we know. Dead cause of that bastard!”
Scrap where Sob tries to force his way past Mandri, but mandri draws his sword.
“You wouldn’t.”
“You’d kill me for that fucker!?”
“I’d kill anyone who throws away the treasure that Ayram has given him.”

They get chased into hole. Stuck between Empire and

“No.”
“Then he is not dead.”
They’re arguing. Pyetle gets up to go see what Mandri is doing.

Pyetle shocked to see Mandri use hands to cause cave in.
Now they have no choice but to go onward
Pyetle is like, wtf, why’d you do that.





Later on a conversation. 
What kind of a fucker kills his own to his own to ingratiate himself with his captors. Everything wrong with the Empire. Its no wonder.

            <Text>“What is it’s name?”
“I do not know.”

Mandri talking with Seculla - 

They’re up looking at the stars.
Pyetle is like, the void is beautiful.
Thats not the void.
What are you talking about. That empty blackness between the stars.

“No. The Void…  it is a difficult thing to imagine because it is not merely‘empty blackness’. The word‘empty’ suggests space, form, and dimension. ‘Blackness’ suggests color, surface, and light. But the Void has none of these things. It’s not something you can see, or even notice. It’s not, ‘where the stars aren’t’, because it has no position. It’s got no properties at all save one: things can come out of it.”
“But if things can come out of it, then it’s got to have -“
“Shut up Pyetle.”
“Are you not familiar with the true story of creation?” Pella asked.
“Not as you would tell it,” Pyetle said.
“Well, the Void is the place - I shouldn’t say ‘the place’. I’ll just say, things come out of the Void. Leave it at that. What’s important is that the grandest of things which came was the Will of Being.”
“This I’ve heard,” Pyetle said.
“It oozed into existence like a heavy smoke,” Pella said. “It seeped through the tight gaps at the edges of reality’s seal. Eons passed and it coalesced into a fertile cloud. Think of it as a ‘cloud of potentiality’.”
“Yes. And then Sol came along and used it to create Life.”
“No, no, no, no. No. There are no Gods yet. There is only this ‘cloud of potentiality’. What we call the Essence of Will. But that’s not the only thing which came from the void. There are other voidclouds. Things like Chaos, Harmony, Despair. How they can sustain themselves without the Will of Being, thats a matter for philosophers. But when these voidclouds mingle with the stuff of Will , thats when things like you and me come into being. Everything tangible is a unique mixture of different quantities of voidcloud. Gods are no different. Sol included. He’s just made of denser stuff.”
“I thought Sol created everything.”
“Sure, that’s what the Empire teaches, but their priests know the truth. Really. I can tell you for a fact that they learn it even the first few years of training. That Sol and humankind are brothers. But it’s an esoteric story and they dont tell it fo political reasons.”
“Political reasons?” Pyetle said doubtful.
“Politcal reasons,” Pella said as she showed him the scar which wrapped around her neck.

Seculla: Do you think he’s a god?
Who? Ayram?
Who else?
I can see why you’d wonder.  But no, I don’t think so.
It’s possible though, right?
Eh.
Why not?
Well if something came from the Void, and it mingled with the Will of Being in just the right way, then I guess it is possible. But primordial things manifest as mountains. Storms. I just don’t think a fleshy prison could contain anything like that. At least not without it being obvious.
You’ve seen the things Ayram can do.
When I say obvious, I mean things like… I don’t know. Like there’s old Jandri tales of a man with glowing eyes and skin shining as bright like fire. Ayram’s just tall. And serious.
But the things he can do.
Being a skilled fighter doesn’t make you a god, Seculla. With his frame, I’d be more inclined to believe he was divine if he couldn’t handle himself in a fight. Why are you wondering all this? Does it have to do with how he found you?




Pella explaining the truth about the gods
The Gods did not come first. Life came first. From life came the gods. But also Man and Woman. The gods are our brothers and sisters. Older brothers, sure. Some much, much younger. But there is no natural hierarchy to Life’s creation. The empire teaches as such only because the Gods demand it. The empire encourages their worship only because it ensures their own survival.

        The poet Mandrameen believed that the strength of nations comes from the people. Aristocrats strut around in parades and give gifts to each other and genuflect in scripted rituals designed to reinforce the pyramid of power, but it's all a sham. Every person is born the same, screaming and naked. A lucky few get called ‘prince’ or ‘princess’ and they’ll be swaddled in blue velvet and given a golden ball to play with; the narrative of their lives is crafted even as they sleep: “Doesn’t she look exactly like a little queen?”. The rest of the howling babes grow up into common folk. Their lot? Simply endure and obey. 
        “Power is a numbers game,” Mandrameen wrote. “There is only one crown, but there are a million hungry mouths.” Every so often a bloated king will set aside this wisdom, convinced of his own inflated worth. He’ll spit in the face of his subjects[a]. In turn his kingdom will set itself ablaze. 
Popular revolts aren’t always successful, but the rich and powerful won’t always escape with their heads. Even Jeket’s most ill-fated revolution - which succeeded only in beheading a nameless prince of a cadet branch of an ailing dynasty - was considered by the mob to be a success. The elites of the city rounded up over a thousand peasants and paupers and threw them into a bonfire out in the desert in a grand display of retribution - but the dying moments of the damned weren’t filled with agony. There was defiance and even joy in their voices as they shouted their anthems of victory over the roaring flames. For them it was enough to have killed just one of the bastards.
That kind of anger is born only from oppression. It’s visceral and consuming, and it is stronger than the will of any one person, no matter what kings, queens, and their sycophantic ilk tell themselves. 
The cynic Seculla disagreed with all this. She was an advisor to Saulistides, and so she had seen the view from commanding heights. From up there, looking down, one thing was clear: only leaders matter. 
Sure, Royalty needs the people and their energy to do anything, but the discontented mob is inevitable. When it isn’t at center stage being manipulated into action, the mob prowls at the margins of history’s pages, clamoring for aimless change.[b] By and large, she remarked, it’s movements are impotent. It is only when the people’s passions are channeled through a single person, a leader, that they accomplish anything of note.
She claimed that the mob is a sword, one that is naturally dull and harmless if it’s never picked up. Most generations are smart enough to leave it lying in the dirt. Some elites, lusting for power by any means, will threaten to use it against their rivals, but they rarely ever actually wield it, because they know the stupidity that they’re dealing with is insatiable. It doesn’t take a close reading of Solean scripture to know that the ambition of even the poorest is a hydra, and that once one demand is severed, two more grow in its place.
The only people foolish enough to set the mob to task are - and for this she borrowed the Mandrameen’s own words - modest men with access to a higher truth. For her, this meant men who are so blinded by righteousness that they see chaos as more desirable to an imperfect union. They’d rather see the streets full of bodies and starving children than to live one more day under the yoke of their betters.
It is worth noting that since Seculla was a courtier of Saulistedes, it would have been prudent, to put it lightly, for her to espouse this view. Perhaps the rumors that she privately agreed with Mandrameen are true, but she served an Emperor, and Emperors believe that they are more important than the rest put together.
Saulistedes famously despised his own subjects. Insert story confirming this - mob murdered much of his family in a half accident as flames consumed his children.
Saulistides’ fury was tempered only by his religion. He was a Solean, and Soleans believe that all humans - regardless of rank - are plagued with the same crude impulses, the same stupidity and ignorance. As such, he knew that he was ultimately incapable of overcoming the infinite varieties of tragedy which might befall his nation. Even if he assumed that he was perfect in wisdom and judgment, the Gods had made him mortal, and his empire risked disintegrating as soon as he died. 
For years Saulistedes struggled with a sense of invincible dread. He desired perfection, certainty, security, and perfect love, but it was all impossible for there was no escaping his own flawed design. Even he, ruler of the largest empire known to man, was doomed by his creators to a life of futility.
In defiance, Saulistides commissioned his mages to construct Beings out of the Aetherium, just as the Gods had constructed Humans. Instead of slaves he intended to create leaders. Instead of a rigid and dysfunctional mind, there was to be an elegant and malleable structure, one which allowed the Being to fix itself, to change its very essence. 
Paragraph trying to explain the magnitude of this. The difference in kind of creatures. Bats can hunt in the dark. Eagles can spot a mouse in a field from a million miles up. 
Only such a creature could lead humans in their struggle against themselves, and more importantly, lead them in the only struggle worthy of the name ‘revolution’: a revolution against the Gods.
The mages guild he commissioned to build these creatures was called the Sacrosanct. Upon hearing the request, they labeled Saulistides a heretic. When they realized how much wealth was at stake and how long of a leash they would be given, they recanted that charge and began to work. When Salistides died, his daughter took on the project. Her son continued it on after her, and his son after him, and so on. Few of the Carcinain Emperors expected any  results, but it quickly became a sanctified tradition. 
Some 400 years after Saulistides’ reign, the Sacrosanct began to produce Beings that could talk, think, and move. Some 300 years more, and these Beings were refined enough in motor function that they could command cities and armies. 
These leaders of Humanity weren’t perfect, but they were approaching it.. The Sacrosanct named them Seilsi, which means ‘spark’ in the native tongue of the Carcinians. Common folk misinterpret this as a reference to the power that these Beings have to conjure electric flame through their hands, but really it is in reference to the Seilsi’s purpose, which is to organize the peoples of the world, the dry tinder, and to set light to it when the time is right.
The Sacrosanct kept secret just how many Seilsi there were at any given moment, but there weren’t many. It should have been a great surprise to Pyetle to find himself locked in a cave cell with one of them. He was completely oblivious to the magnitude of the moment.  
His only concern was his discomfort. His centuries-old cell had been hollowed out of the sandstone, but it retained a bulbous and natural shape, so there was no corner in which to tuck himself away. He was forced to sit right up close to this stranger, who was slumbering away in the dark. There was just enough light that Pyetle could make out that the man was almost nude was covered in dried blood. What’s more is that he was missing his hands, and that on the stubs of his forearms were bandages so caked with glistening blood and pus that they were leaking. The poor wretch just lay there in the cool darkness, beaten and bloody, looking so much like a tortured soul from hell. The stench was haunting. Pyetle hardly dared to breathe.
This was a regular outlaw, Pyetle assumed, a thief of thieves who was being punished for his crimes in brutal frontier fashion. Pyetle did sense an aura about him, but it was unnaturalness, not greatness. Each time he looked upon the near-corpse of a man he was filled with a strange sense of discordance. When he finally mustered the courage to place it, he found that he wasn’t sure if the man were a man at all;  his features seemed feminine, and his frame was lithe and skinny, and the cloth which wrapped his groin seemed wrapped so tight that it couldn’t possibly contain any private parts. If he wasn’t a woman, he must have been a young castrato - older than boy, but young. 
There was also the fact that he didn’t seem to have any hair. There was no scruff on his chest, and he wasn’t just bald, he had no eyebrows. Though it was too dark to really tell, he seemed to be missing even his eyelashes.
All in all, it disgusted Pyetle. So great was his revulsion that he shuddered and tucked in his feet when the young man’s body suddenly curled up in a violent coughing fit.
Blood and spittle flew, and when it was over, the poor wretch wiped his lips with the pitiful stump of his arm. Pyetle expected him to whimper or sob after such a brutal wracking, but the lad simply lay his head back down against the rock and sighed.
He was awake.
The hairs on Pyetle’s arms and legs pricked up when he noticed that the young man’s eyes were open, glinting in the darkness. They were searching him over, studying him. Pyetle returned a weak smile, but felt foolish when he realized that he was sitting in the shadow and the young man probably couldn’t see it. They were just sitting there, the two of them, staring at each other in an uneasy bond of silence.
Pyetle felt he should say something, but the young man spoke first.
“Are you one of my jailers?” he asked. His voice was quite soft and clear, nearly a woman’s voice. It put Pyetle off a little to hear such pleasant tones coming from someone in  such a wretched state, and so he took an odd beat to respond.
“No.” he said. “I’m Pyetle. I’m not in control here if that's what you want to know.”
“Well, Pyetle, my name is Mazyd.” The young man closed his eyes and sighed again, wincing in pain as he tried to find a more comfortable position.
But Pyetle was eager for conversation.
“Fine day, Isn’t it?” he asked.
Mazyd did not answer. Instead, he took a deep breath, sat upright, and [c]asked a question out of turn. 
“Why are you here?”
“Well…” Pyetle mumbled as he searched for a good answer. “I guess you could say I’m a new recruit.” 
At that the Mazyd laughed, or rather, he tried to laugh but he fell into a cough - this time when the blood and spittle came out it stained Pyetle’s toes.
“Pardon me. Sorry. I would cover my mouth with my hands but -” and he held his arms,“ I was recently robbed of them.”
“Well... I, uh…”
“It’s all good,” Mazyd said with a chuckle. “I don’t blame you for falling in with these demons. We all do what we must. But why are you in here with me, if you’re one of them?”
“I was told that they don’t trust me just yet. Don’t want me slinking around their hideaway.”
“They don’t trust you?”
        “I’ve only just joined.”
“Do you trust them?” Mazyd asked.
“No… Well... I suppose I do a little… Actually no, I don’t at all. I was just thinking that, you know, I must be trusting them a little to let them whisk me away and throw me in here, but then again, I don’t really care if I live or die, I don’t care what happens to me, so it’s not really a matter of trust.”
Again the young man’s eyes flashed over Pyetle, who cut nearly as pitiful a figure there in the damp dark. Pyetle was small, skinny and balding. Every part of him was disheveled. 
“You don’t care if you die?” the young man asked. 
“Not really, no.”
“Why not?”
“Well…” Pyetle paused to consider his lot. “Im old. Old enough. I’ve lost too much. Too much loss, too late in life. Mix in some betrayal.”
“I see.”
“I just don’t have the energy or will to start up again. There’s just not enough time left for me, so even if I wanted to go back to the grind and work my life back up, there wouldn’t be any time left to just enjoy it all. So, it’s just a good time to give up.”
“Yet you took up with thieves?”
Pyetle shrugged. “This wasn’t planned. I’m only here because of a strange coincidence.”
“There’s no such thing as coincidence,” Mazyd said.
Pyetle nodded in mock acceptance. “Yes, yes,” he said. “Everything happens through the will of the Gods.”
        “That’s not what I mean.”
“Oh?”
“Just because you can’t see the chain of consequence that leads to your misery, that doesn’t mean that there isn’t one.”
“Well it’s good that you feel that way.” Pyetle said. He was a little stunned that Mazyd could be so sure of himself, considering his state. “That’s really good,” he repeated. “Impressive, really. If I were in you I’d be cursing everything. Fate especially. ”
“No, this is my fault,” Mayzd said. “At least, I don’t think it defies imagination to say that somewhere along the way I made a few mistakes.” Mazyd said this with a great deal of levity, and it surprised Pyetle to see the glint of Mazyd’s white teeth. The bloody pulp of a man was actually smiling.
“I suppose you’re right,” Pyetle said, smiling in turn. “But it doesn’t matter. Let’s just say that I happened upon the most striking person I’ve ever met at a pivotal crossroad in my life. That’s why I’m here.”
“Who was this person?”
“The leader of this robber band. His name is Ayram. You can’t have missed him.”
The young man shook his head and said, “I’ve only heard voices.”
“Well, when you meet him you’ll know who he is.”
Mazyd grunted in a show of indifference and slumped down against the rock. 
“Do you owe this man a debt?” he asked.
Pyetle sat back and considered Mazyd’s question, as he hadn’t thought of it. Did he owe Aryam a debt? Ayram had saved him from Death, but that in itself didn’t bother him. Sure, it would have been cruel to die at Salavan’s hands, so he supposed he could thank Ayram for that - but a debt? Ayram was going to kill Salavan anyways. The whole thing was just a coincidence.
He didn’t spend too long thinking about it, because even if there was an honor debt to be paid, he no longer cared about honor. That was a game for people with something to lose.
“No, he’s just an interesting person,” Pyetle finally said. “He’s immense. It’s not just his size, it’s his presence. It’s exciting just to be around him.”
        “So you decided to float along in his wake?”
“Something like that.”
“Well…” Mazyd said, straightening his back to sit upright, so that he might treat with Pyetle more personably ,“It’s nice to meet you, Pyetle.” He stuck out his arm for a handshake, then looked down at his bloody stump, and laughed. Pyetle laughed along with him.
“How about an elbow?” Pyetle asked, and he stuck his out. Mazyd bumped it with his own, and smiled again.
“It seems like neither of us have any friends here,” Mazyd said, “and I’m in a pretty bad way. Pyetle, I need a friend right now, and you’re it. You don’t have a choice. I don’t care if you’re not interested, do what you want. I’m a little desperate. I just need the glimmer of hope that a friend can give - even if it's a one-way deal.”
“I’m not -”
        “No, no, no,” Mazyd interrupted. “ You just do whatever you want. Just know that from this point on, whatever trust you put in me, I’ll treasure it.”
        Pyetle shrugged his shoulders.
“You do what you want,” Mazyd repeated. “My life isn’t worth much at the moment. They’ll probably kill me before tomorrow. I just don’t want to die without a friend nearby.”  
Pyetle wasn’t sure how to handle this doomed man’s wish. If Pyetle were younger, he would have humored Mazyd out of pity, but time had squeezed the empathy out of him. Plus, he didn’t know why Mazyd was locked up, nor why Ayram had elected to chop off his hands. It could have been simple theft, but it could be something unforgivable - Mazyd could be the kind of person to set his hands on another man’s wife. 
“Why are you in here?” Pyetle asked.
Mazyd sighed. “I was marching along with my people towards Jeket when your people ambushed us in the Junei hills.”
“What were you doing out there?”
Pyetle’s question gave Mazyd pause. He began to scrutinize his new friend. “We were about the Emperor’s business,” he said.
“What?”
        “That surprises you?”
“Well, yes. I figured you to be a thief.”
“No.”
“So, what, you’re a soldier?”
“More or less.”
        “Why did they cut off your hands?”
“Because I’m a magus.”
“Really?” Pyetle said, his voice pitching in excitement. “Could you show me a little something?” he asked.
        Mazyd just held up his bandaged arms to remind Pyetle of his predicament.
“Right,” said Pyetle, disappointed as much as the absence of proof for Mazyd’s story. “Well Mazyd, you’re either a fantastic thief and liar, or you’ve got the worst lot of any person  I’ve ever met - well anyone that’s lived past twenty. How old are you?”
“One hundred and twenty two.”
“What?
“One hundred and -” But before Mayzd could repeat the number, he was interrupted by the echoes of feet slapping on the damp stone outside. Then keys scratched at the lock, and the door creaked open. Torchlight flooded into the cell, giving Pyetle a clean view of Mazyd. The shock of him was nearly blinding. He wasn’t just covered in blood. His body from his feet up to his neck were covered in intricate arrangement of symbols tattooed in black. It was the unmistakable markings of a Seilsi. 
Pyetle’s jaw fell open.
“Oi, Sandie! He’s awake!”
“Well, bring him out then.”
One of the two captors stepped into the cell. He was a scruffy looking man with a long nose. 
“Can you stand up?” he asked Mazyd. “I’d help but I don’t want to touch you, mate.”
The woman behind him chuckled.  “Oh, help him up Deedee. You twit.”
“I’ll do no such thing.”
Mazyd looked to Pyetle, but Pytle was still stunned by the sight of him, so  he put his feet under his butt and labored up to a standing position by using the wall behind him for support.
“What about you?” Deedee asked. “You’re alright, right? Name’s Pyetle, right?”
Hearing his name spoken aloud snapped Pyetle to attention. “Yes, that is my name,” he said. 
“We’re off to a bit of a meeting. You’re invited.”
Pyetle stood up and stretched his back, all the while gawking at Mazyd. He’d never dreamed he’d see a Seilsi this up close, or in this place of all places. He followed Mazyd and Deedee out of the cell and into the cave proper, where Sandie waited. She was holding the only torch, and it’s flickering light illuminated the narrow slip of rock under her feet. The rest of the ground fell into a large blue-green pool of mineral water. 
Pyetle wondered what part of the continent’s drainage system this could possibly be. He had never heard of such a cave in this part of the world. It’s walls were waxy and seemed to be frozen mid-melt. Glistening strands of hard seemed to drip from the ceiling like saliva on the roof of a lizard’s mouth. The water was alive. Shapes moved and little lights flashed in its depths. Deedee swept Pyetle along before he had time to worry.
They moved on into a tunnel that led up towards the surface. With each step the rock became dryer, and the going got steeper. Mazyd struggled along. He walked with his elbows tucked tight against his body, fearing to brush his arms against a stray shadow of a rock. It compromised his balance, and coupled with the recent loss of blood, he was sure to move slowly.
The others accomodated him. Mazyd cut such a tragic figure that, even though Deedee and Sandie despised him in principle, they couldn’t help but pity him. They weren’t cruel people, but this little march felt cruel.
Here and there they would pass a tunnels that spread off in odd directions, up and down, skewing this way that, leading off into some unknown abyss.
“What created this place?” Pyetle wondered aloud.
“Hell if I know,” Deedee said. “Ayram might.”
        “Ayram knows,” Sandie corrected, but she didn’t expound upon it. Pyetle didn’t feel like he was in any position to ask to do so.  
Eventually, they came out into a massive open-air pit cave. Pyetle’s eyes took time to adjust, for the circle of sky above was bright and blue, and the sun’s light angled down the colossal sandstone walls and fell upon the sand in a dusty, radiant glow. 
Twenty-five of Ayram’s band were in attendance. They were a motley crew of every race and color, and they congregated on the shadowed side of the pit across from where Pyetle stood. This wasn’t a living space, and so there weren’t many furnishings - just a few logs and makeshift chairs to sit on, as well as a few crude tents set up on the sunny-side of the pit. There wasn’t anything that couldn’t be packed away at a moment's notice. 
Pyetle spied a few others high up on the rim. They were supposed to be lookouts, but they were eager to be down with the others, eager to be part of the buzz of excitement that filled the pit. This excitement was contagious. It worked its way into Pyetle when he, Mazyd, Deedee and Sandie made their way out into the sunlight. 
All chatter ceased and all eyes turned to them. None seemed to care much for Pyetle, as Mazyd’s pale and bloody pulp captivated the crowd.
One of their number stood up, and like the shadow of a tree he towered over the others. He let loose a shrill whistle for attention. Everyone else promptly sat down. The giant then began walke to Pyetle and his company, out of the shadow and into the light, and Pyetle saw that it was Ayram. Who else.
 Pyetle looked at Mazyd who stood transfixed in Ayram’s gaze. He wondered.Then there came a tugging at Pyetle’s shirt. It was Deedee.
He was beckoning Pyetle to follow and whispered, “Come on!” 
Pyetle trailed him around the edge of the pit to join the others in the pit’s shadow. Ayram began to speak just as he sat down.
“Before we decide what to do with this prisoner -” Ayram slapped Mazyd on the back. The action nearly buckled Mazyd’s knees. He looked like a child next to Ayram. Everyone does. 
“Before we decide what to do about him, we need to address Papi and Colm. It’s come to my attention that some of you are blaming Elrahet for their deaths.” Ayram had his arm extended out, and his piercing blue eyes were scanning the crowd, as if to accuse them all, even the ones who dared listened to the gossip. “That stops now.” 
He let the finality of his words echo around the pit. Whatever ill-will his people bore towards his witch, it was now gone.  
“In case you aren’t aware,” he continued, “this man here is a Seilsi!”
He shoved Mazyd forward and down to the ground. 
A chorus of whispered mutterings broke out in the crowd. Not all had descended from the Empire or the Solean religion, but they had all by now heard the rumors about their prisoner, and this startling confirmation settled on them like a wet blanket. 
Pyetle was especially moved to see a Seilsi brought so low.
“For those of you who don’t know,” Ayram said, “this slight excuse for a man is one of the Empire’s most lauded generals and one of its most coveted weapons. He could have killed us all in heartbeat if Elrahet’s storm hadn’t raged.”
“Elrahet!” cheered one of the crowd, and the rest clapped in approval.
“We should also thank Pella for her quick decision to take this scoundrel’s hands.” Even as Ayram said it, the cheers and plaudits grew loud for Pella. Pyetle followed Deedee’s gaze and saw an old woman soaking it. She was smiling and waving as if all the others were her children.
“Many more than just Papi and Colm would have died if it weren’t for that bolt of fire from the sky,” Ayram declared. “If my command is not enough, and any of you still have something to settle about Papi and Colm, then it's me you need to see. There’s no room in this life for bitch talk and rabble rousers. You have a problem, come see me.” He slapped his great chest with his fist, daring them to actually do it. “ I’ll be fair for as long as you are honest.”
“Now,” he said, turning to the crumpled form of Mazyd.  He reached down with one hand, grabbed him by the neck, and pulled him up to his feet. “What are you doing in my desert?”
Mazyd stood there, his face drawn tight in pain, and did not answer. 
“Speak, man!” Ayram shouted. “Is the Empire so scared of my family that they’d send you to root us out?”
Mazyd looked up at Ayram and said in the most matter of fact tone imaginable, “I don’t even know who you are.”
        Ayram grinned beneath his beard and a wild look came into his eyes. “You know, I can tell when someone is lying.”
“All I know is that your name is Ayram.”
“And your what is your name, sir?” Ayram asked.
“Mazyd Uro.” 
“Pella! Is this the one who burned your family alive?”
Pella shouted her answer. “No! I’ve not heard that name.”
“Mazyd Uro…” Ayram repeated. “You were sent to hunt us, yes? A devious Imperial trap, no?”
“Have you not stopped to consider,” Mazyd said with frustration, “That you were the trap for me?”
“Aye, but I don’t think anyone would reasonably expect that such a small band of simple thieves could overcome a Seilsi mage. No one would send a wolf like you into a den of foxes and expect it to lose. Hah!”
“Yet here I am.”
“Here you are indeed. But why? This won’t be over until I get an answer. I can get Elrahet involved if you like. A little blood magic will tease it out of you. You’ve got enough of it left, no?”
Mazyd looked out at the faces of the crowd. He found Pyetle’s and smiled.
“I was looking for your hovel in the mountains,” he said.
“We have no such place.”
“The Jandrian tribes. The place they’ve all fled to. It's some ruin in the mountains.”
“Urgiz?”
“Yes, that’s what they call it.”
“And what do you care about that forsaken place?”
For the first time, Mayzed took Ayram eye to eye, and said, “I was tasked to deliver a sword to your king.” 
A stillness swept over the crowd. One of them stood and shouted, “He lies!&quot;
Another stood and tried to shout him down. “A Seilsi does not lie!” 
Mazyd looked out at Ayram’s followers to let them judge for themselves the earnest truth written on his face. 
“The light of the law is coming to you and your kin!” he shouted.
“You mean the light of War!” 
“Barbarians make war,” Mazyd spat. “The Empire makes peace!”
His words set the band of outlaws buzzing. Pyetle was pushed into the sand as others rushed over him, each shouting “Murderer!”, and “Demon!”. Deedee was enraptured. He stood next to Pyetle’s and shouted, “Genocidal Demon!” so many times and with so much gusto that he nearly fainted. 
Ayram himself was unmoved. He held out his hand, but when that didn’t work he let loose another shrill whistle. The outlaws settled back down.
“We did find a sword,” Ayram said. “We found seventy-seven of them!”
At that there was a great cheer. Mazyd rolled his eyes.
“But yes, we did find an unusual one, too. Pella, bring it here.”
Old Pella got up, walked to Ayram, and pulled from her bundle of robes a wooden sword. It was immaculately carved and polished to a sheen. The base of its blade and its guard was inlaid with gold, and its half-shell pommel was trimmed with jade stars. Burned into its comically dull edge were words in old Carcinain. They read, “This blade will do as well as any other.”
The message was clear: when the Empire comes knocking, you might as well defend yourself with a stick.
        The sight of the sword quieted what was left of the grumbling crowd. A few wept. They were outlaws and they killed, but what the Empire had done to them and their kind was another thing entirely. 
        “This man thought he could stroll into Urgiz and present this sword to Lindrimuud. So sure of his power, he thought he could stroll right out again, unmolested. Look at him now. Well I shall not be the one to stand in your way, Mazyd Uro. This sword belongs to Lindrimuud, and since the Emporer sent you, then you’ll be the one to bring it to him. But!” he said, and brought his face close to Mazyd’s. “You’ll not be walking out like you planned.”

As you improve order,  you improve productivity. At some point, productivity peaks and then it goes back down again - too much order and nothing can happen. The force factor that drives you toward order is unstoppable. Any organization will move to where their productivity is stymied by order.  Inevitably, the organization gets captured by all the bureaucracies that manage the processes. So where is the counter force? &lt;—— AYRAM

You have to praise people before they do something - not after. They’ll hate you if you do it after. Have to do it before.

Lot’s of people are only working for praise.

 The poet Mandrameen believed that the Empire’s religions were all distortions of the Truth, but nonetheless, they were our only way to access it. Since each religion was distorted in its own way, he taught that any honest seeker of the Truth must be a practitioner of all religions. For this he built an analogy out of the famous Library of Jeket.
If an artist were locked inside and wanted to paint a perfectly accurate picture of the marble Pillar of Saulistides which stands out in the garden, the artist must look through the building’s windows to see it - windows whose glass was famously fogged and warped with age. In one window pane, the pillar would appear stretched. In another it would seem waved. In yet another it would seem so curved that the friezes of Saulistedes’ armies which wrapped around the marble would climb up into the sky. 
Since each window distorted the Pillar in its own peculiar way, it would be a mistake for the artist to sit still. They should instead move from window to window, from distortion to distortion, averaging out the truth of the Pillar’s shape from the lies.
This was how Mandrameen practiced religion - by moving from one religion to another, averaging out the true shape of Reality from ancient myths so distorted with age. He would consider them together, and start with their similarities instead of their differences. In time, he found what he believed to be was the core of every religion, and thus the core of the human condition: whether it be by accident or intention, we were designed to suffer. Suffering is not just part of the landscape, it’s baked into our very bones.
The Cult of the Dreamer, for example, believed that suffering is brought into the world by nightmares that emerge from untrained minds as they sleep. The Soleans believed that humans were created by their pantheon of Gods to be slaves. These Gods imbued us with Greed and its children (Lust, Pride, and Paroch), hoping keep us angry at each other instead of angry at our masters. The Kalemites believed that we were once a link in the Great Chain of Being, once part of an indistinguishable whole. However, the profane lure of individuality caught a hold of one of the Number, and so this misguided soul severed its link to the Chain, spawning all life on earth, dooming us and the animals to an existence where our minds can never touch one another’s, to a state of being where it is possible to be lost, forgotten, and unloved.
The cynic Seculla was not impressed. She thought that Mandrameen’s study of religions was biased towards those that could survive the Empire. Any religion which might preach that Paradise is here and that Peace is now would be trampled underfoot by hordes of the suffering and damned, for they demand answers and atonement for their troubles and a religion which preaches contentment with the present simply cannot give it. 
She pointed to the religion of the isolated tribe of Het, and quoted the difficulty that priests of the Dreamer had in converting them. “They cannot see through the eyes of the Dreamer for they are not plagued by His nightmares,” one priest wrote. “Here, food is plenty. War is absent. They spend their days swimming, fishing, and building houses high in the trees. They are happy… they simply do not understand.” Two of the priests sent to convert this tribe abandoned their frocks and took up wives in that Hetian village. This was proof, to Seculla at least, that suffering was not an intrinsic part of the human condition. It comes from somewhere else.

Thats problematic for me
I know but thats how I view it.
Sometimes they exhibit a bit of good, but for the most part they’re bad. And that’s it. That’s being human.
That’s not necessarily true. You choose to think that way. That’s a dumb as saying everyone is good and rosy. Right?
I have my view, you have yours.
Sure.
You’re an optimist, I’m a pessimist. I’m a realist.
I don’t know if that’s being a realist.
Hey there you go, you’re being agressive.
I’m not being aggressive.
Yeah you’re being assertive.

It couldn’t have been gold. Gold would have survived the blast. The only things they’d managed to scavenge were the shattered effects of men roughing it on long march; things like half-melted tinpots and broken brass bands for barrels that would have held beer. There was nothing left of the Imperials themselves save half an arm that was found still strapped to the splintered remnants of a shield.

As the only bit of spoils, the shield was argued over by Bullo and Purloin all the way back to the cave. At present, they were arguing by the fire. Bullo was hovering over Purloin who was squatting over the shield, trying to undo the straps that held the severed arm tight to it. They paid no attention to the mage who was set down next to them.
“At least get the arm out first,” Bullo said.
“What do you think I’m doing?” Purloin spat.
“Then undo the damned knot.”
“It’s not the knot that’s keeping it on,” Purloin said reflexively. “The arm’s melted into the damn thing.”
“Arms don’t melt into things.”
“Seeing as how the skin here is melted into the thing, I’m inclined to disagree.”
“What? Lemme see.” 
The only reason Purloin made room for Bullo to take a look was because the sight of the arm’s flesh fused into the shield was sickening. In any other circumstance he would have told Bullo to ‘sod off’.
“Well I’ll be,” Bullo muttered as he poked at the place where the arm’s flesh spilled out onto the wood. He wasn’t so easily put off, even as the skin stuck to his finger like glue. He rubbed the bit of oily flesh in between his finger and his thumb. 
“So it is melted,” he said. “Didn’t think it worked like that.”
Purloin noticed Pella hovering over them. “Ever seen something like this, Pella?” he asked.
“I seen it in a village called Coldbreeze,” Pella said.
“Blood magic?”
“No. It was a Mazydei that did this.”
“A Mazydei…” Bullo repeated. His eyes fell on the captive mage, and his eyes widened in wonder. “Does that mean that he’s…”
Pella simply nodded.

You went to school right? Your a merchant right? You know simple arithemtic?
Division, subtraction, that kind of thing?
Yeah. I’ve got a great problem for measuring whether or not someone is capable.
Capble? INtelligent?
Well its just a little problem. Doesn’t take any real training other than arithmetic to figure it out. It takes arithmetic and the slightest smidge of insight. 
I don’t like tests
Well its simple. Lets say you have one-hundred soldiers.
Oh dear.
One hundred soldiers- fresh recruits - and One thousand Denars to train them with.
Ok.
The recruits can be trained into two different companies. Infantry and Cavalry. Infantry training costs 4 denars. Cavalry costs 12. You with me so far?
One thousand denars. One hundred soldiers. Four. Twelve.
Good. So the task is this: What is the maximum number of Cavalry can you train if you have to train all troops under budget.
What’s that now?
You’ve got 1000 Denars. One hundred soldiers to train. Cavalry costs 12. Infantry costs 6.  You need to train all soldiers with that 1000 denars. What is the maximum number of Cavalry you can train?
I might need a little bit with this one.
The answer isnt nearly as impotant as how you get it.

“Now, the ancient emperor Saulistides understood all this. He understood where power truly lay, and he hated it. He couldn’t control it. Not forever at least. After all, he was a mortal man, and mortal men die, and could not live forever to save his empire from crumbling. This filled him with a sense of invincible dread. One day his destruction would come. We would come.”
A silence but its a motivated one. She was reaching htem.
“That leads us to this… creature.” She prods the Mazydei with her stick.
“In defiance of the gods, the people, and Nature itself, Saulistides commissioned his scholars and mages to create these things.” Pella whacked the Mazydei on the back the head with her staff. There was a crack and he cried out and crumpled forward.

Animal that attacks by vomiting it’s stomach out. Stomach has fangs. Prolapsed stomach.
 Many species dine on animals with bones or shells, so little bits can get stuck in the Mucous-y lining of their stomach. Seastar - everts stomach, secretes digestive enzymes which break down the prey into a soupy chowder substance. The stomach is then pulled back into the body and the food is transferred to the pyloric stomach to finish digestion.

Psychopathic stare - prelude to self gratification or exercise of power. Not a stare of interest or of empathy. Cold. Detached, Emotionless, icy, intense, piercing, empty, penetrating.
Unblinking stare.



“Power is a numbers game,” the preacher shouted. “There is only one crown, but there are a million hungry mouths.” Every so often a bloated king will set aside this wisdom, convinced of his own inflated worth. He’ll spit in the face of his subjects. He might refuse to buy grain at the ancient price, or he’ll debase the currency to pay for wars of vanity. In turn his kingdom will set itself ablaze. 
Popular revolts aren’t always successful, but the rich and powerful won’t always escape with their heads. Even Jeket’s most ill-fated revolution - which succeeded only in beheading a nameless prince of a cadet branch of an ailing dynasty - was considered by the mob to be a success. In response, the elites of the city rounded up over a thousand peasants and paupers, lathered them in camel fat, then threw them into a bonfire out in the desert. Even as their bones slid out from their boiling bodies, the poor shouted anthems of defiance. For them it was enough to have killed just one of the bastards. That’s the anger of the oppressed. It’s visceral and consuming, and it is stronger than the will of any one person, no matter what kings, queens, and their sycophantic ilk tell themselves. 
Seculla disagreed with all this. 
She was an adviser to Saulistides, and so she had seen the view from commanding heights. From up there, looking down, one thing was clear: only leaders matter. 
She wrote that the mob is a sword, but it needs picking up. Most generations are smart enough to leave it lying in the dirt. Some elites, lusting for power, will threaten to use it against their rivals, but they rarely ever actually wield it, because they know the stupidity that they’re dealing with is insatiable. It doesn’t take a close reading of Solean scripture understand that the ambition of even the poorest is a hydra, and that once one demand is severed, two more grow in its place.
The only people foolish enough to set the mob to task are - and for this she borrowed the Mandrameen’s own words - modest men with access to a higher truth. For her, this meant men who are so blinded by righteousness that they see chaos as more desirable to an imperfect union. They’d rather see the streets full of children’s bodies than to live one more day under the yoke of betters.
It is worth noting that since Seculla was a courtier of Saulistedes, it would have been prudent, to put it lightly, for her to espouse this view. Perhaps the rumors that she privately agreed with Mandrameen are true, but she served Saulistides,  Insert story confirming this - mob murdered much of his family in a half accident as flames consumed his children.

Paragraph trying to explain the magnitude of this. The difference in kind of creatures. Bats can hunt in the dark. Eagles can spot a mouse in a field from a million miles up. 
Only such a creature could lead humans in their struggle against themselves, and more importantly, lead them in the only struggle worthy of the name ‘revolution’: a revolution against the Gods. There would be no facade of power or prestige. These would be creatures that men could look to and see something better, unquestionably better, than themselves.
The mages guild he commissioned to build these creatures was called the Sacrosanct. Upon hearing the request, they labeled Saulistides a heretic. When they realized how much wealth was at stake and how long of a leash they would be given, they recanted that charge and began to work. When Salistides died, his daughter took on the project. Her son continued it on after her, and his son after him, and so on. Few of the Carcinain Emperors expected any  results, but it quickly became a sanctified tradition. 
Some 400 years after Saulistides’ reign, the Sacrosanct began to produce Beings that could talk, think, and move. Some 300 years more, and these Beings were refined enough in motor function that they could command cities and armies. 
These leaders of Humanity weren’t perfect, but they were approaching it. The Sacrosanct named them Mazydei, which means ‘sparks’ in the native tongue of the Carcinians. Common folk misinterpret this as a reference to the power that these Beings have to conjure thunder and flame with their hands, but really it is in reference to the Mazydei’s purpose, which is to organize the peoples of the world, the tinder, and to set light to it when the time is right.

Then you have to talk or I have to talk. I get scared when it gets quiet. I was with mother alot, and grandmother, and they would go uptown and see a movie or somethin, and they would always leave me with him. Cause he was either home drunk or with a hangover from bein drunk, and then that was when he would do what he did to me. And I can remember crying and goin to the door and beggin for them not to leave me and they would, every time. I can remember one time I had a girl to spend the night with me, and he did it. And my mother was there, a lot of times.
You think you regressed?
I know I did.
Tell me about that.
Well. To begin with, I don’t know how I did or when it first started. Because I didn’t realize it when it happened. But, somehow or another, I got the feeling that I would have a better time with younger people. Which I was havin a pretty good time. Until I realized it all had to come to an end. The way I realized that was to get a divorce. I don’think I could be married to a man like him.
Why is that?
Well he is a hard working man. And when someone makes love to me now, I want them to be affectionate and consoling, not just there to have sexual intercourse. And I have never had that. I think thats why I kind of turned against Dr. Graham. When I’m with him I’ll feel attracted towards him. Then he’ll say somethin that hits me the wrong way and I go to pieces.

Why didn’t you care if someone got killed?

-petit mal epilepsy - short seizures which resemble fainting. Can occur several hundred times per day. General pattern - sudden lapse of conscious during which there is a vacant stare and fluttering of the eyelids. If the patient is doing anything when the attack occurs, there is a momentary cessation, then a continuation of the action, often without the patient being aware of the interruption.

- grand mal epilepsy - deformed nose from many falls. Nose smushed up into his face lik a pigs, but with none of the symmetry.  Period just before the attack, where the patient feels a disturbing sensation known as an ‘aura’. During this period, a definite change from the normal brain rhythm occurs. When the attack begins, the patient usually utters a sharp cry, and whether standing or sitting, suddenly falls. In a typical grand mal attack, marked pallor is followed by deep cyanosis. The body is rigid at first, the tonic spasms of the muscles cause the limbs to jerk in a convulsive movement. The eyes roll upwards or to the side. The pupils dialate, and the facial expression becomes distorted. The convulsions are usually repeated.  The entire seizure may last minutes. THen the patient will usually sleep.

ll of Jandria was fnce a paradise, filled with rivers and beasts and bounty. But one day, it is unclear as to how, the Great Demon Damdramood escaped from the Underworld. then dug the Sol’s Stone, the Stone of Creation, out from the earth. Without the Stone to give it life, the continent withered, and over the eons it was transformed by the elements into the Sand. 
When Damdramood stole the stone he brought it to the Inner Mountain. He used it to build an army of demons to contend with Sol. When Sol returned to the Earth, as he did every hundred years, he discovered what Damdramood had done. Sol assaulted Dandramood’s mountain, and he slaughtered the great demon in his throne room. 
But Sol did not return the Stone to the Earth. He could not discover how Damdramood had escaped from the Underworld, and so he feared another Great Beast could do the same. And so, Sol hid the stone in the mountain, and sealed it off with magics that no living being could penetrate. 
Instead of rescuing the stone, and planting it back in the soil so that continent could grow anew, Sol .

A gruff voice behind them in spoke up. “It ain’t your business to be askin’ what Ayram do with the women.”
“Sob is right.” Hill said. “Pyetle, this is Sob.”
Pyetle turned. 
“No worry ‘bout him,” Hill said to Pyetle. “Sob least dangerous. Well, you least dangerous, but he next.”
“I see. Is there anyone I shouldn’t be worrying about?”
“Oh. I think…” Hill rubbed his chin and stared at something in the dirt. “Worry about - ah, worry about the ladies. Look at them. Don’t look at them.”
Pyetle followed Hill’s gaze, and saw Pella and the other women marching out of the cave.
“You not young,” Hill said. “But still, sure you have strong, eh, strong sex urge, no?”
Aside from Pella and another older, frazzled, bow legged creature, each of the women were as fit as any of the men. One of them caught Pyetle’s eye especially. She was younger than the rest, and quite stunning in a rough, serious kind of way. Hill caught Pyetle staring.
“That’d be Relsa.”
“What?”
“The girl. That’s Relsa.”
“Oh? Yes. I’m just surprised to see a girl like that with this bunch.”
“Wait till you see Sendren.”
“Which one is she?”
“He’s over there.” Hill said, pointing to a young man nodding off against the rock wall.
Pyetle thought the boy Sendren was handsome, no doubt. He had a square, clean jaw. Even features. But Pyetle didn’t go in for that kind of thing. Hill, on the other hand, was nearly drooling. It made Pyetle start to wonder. The male-female ratio *was* out of natural balance.
“Two pretty crows,” Hill mumbled.
“How old are they?”
“I not know. Seventeen? I not ask. I just, eh, look.” He smiled. “But, eh, they have eachother.”
“They’re together, I take it?”
“Could they not be? Pretty bird fly in pair when they fly in the Sand. Pretty crow especially. The rest of us, eh.”
“No one else is together?”
“There be others. But remember what Sob say: everything belong to Ayram.”
Pyetle looked on confusion.
“You will see it for the best,” Hill continued. “People die too fast out here. He the only one who don’t break heart by dying first. But, uh, oh yeah - the Lizard boys. Who to worry bout. Worry bout the Lizard boys. Jadrameen and Kit. Jadri and Kit. They not good boys.”
“Which ones are those?” Pyetle asked, scanning the crowd.
“You know when you see. But who else… Ah, here come the one you no worry about it.”

“Moteah! Shef-sial!” Hill called.

“I don’t get it,” Pyetle said, “If there’s riders out there, why don’t we flee through the Underworld, like earlier?”
“Your time down there must’ve given you the wrong impression about that place.”
“A little cold, but seemed fine. Ayram knows his way around, right?”


“Do you mind if I sit with you?” Mandrameen asked. “I’d like to ask you some questions.”
“Sure. Of course.” Pyetle replied. Mandrameen was smiling and so he smiled back. thought how strange it was that despite his great depression, his sociability bubbled up nonetheless.
“Normally we’re a friendlier bunch, but recent events have been stressful,” Mandrameen said.
“Oh it’s no worry.”
“I hear things are all very fresh for you as well.”
“Fresh?” Pyetle asked.
“Fresh memories,” Mandrameen clarified. “I like to get at them while they’re fresh.” Mandrameen reached into his leather pack and pulled out a folded ream of paper. 
Pyetle looked on in confusion. He’d hardly expected to see a lad with so much paper here amongst the Ayramun. But the boy did have a scholarly look about him. 
Mandrameen unfolded a page and tried to iron out the crease with the palm of his hand. “Memories are worst when they’re fresh,” he said. “They’re more complete, sure, and that’s why I want to get you aside right now, but they’ve got none of the weight or the clarity of a long-treasured tale. Still, I want to get it fresh because, you know. So let’s just focus on the details, we’ll leave the flavor for when you’ve had time to stew.”
“I’m sorry, I don’t know what you’re getting at.  ”
“I want to know how Ayram found you.”

Pyetle looked at Mandrameen through squinted eyes. He had no idea what the young man was on about. Mandri pulled out a scrap of paper and bit charcoal from his bag.
“Pyetle, pyetle. Family name?”
“Pyetle Andramawmun.”
“Jandrian? I guess I can see it. Father Jandrian, Mother from -”
“Mother’s family from Carcina.”
“From the Capitol? Interesting. How did she get - well that’s for later. Right now its the fresh memories I want. How are you feeling right now?”
“I’m warming up.”
“I mean mentally, what’s your mood. Where are you at right now?”
“My mood? I don’t know. Confused.”
“Confused, yes. Yes, that’s it. So how did Ayram find you?”
“Ayram? Well… I wouldn’t say he found me. It was all just a kind of coincidence.”
“It wasn’t a coincidence.”
“He was looking for someone else and I just happened to be there, so-”
“There’s no such thing as coincidence.”
Pyetle chuckled and said, “You know, the Seilsi told me just the same not too long ago.”
“Did he? He’s right. With Ayram, at least, there’s no such thing as coincidence. So tell me how it happened.”
“I’d rather not. It’s not my brightest moment.”
“I didn’t expect it would be. Ayram found me in a gully. I was half-dead. I was trying to kill myself.”
“Oh? How were you p ”

“What? Come on man. Out with it.”

There is some evidence, based on analyses of both clothing represented in art and preserved skin imprint patterns at Çatalhöyük in Turkey, that the usage of the cilice predates written history. This finding has been mirrored at Göbekli Tepe, another Anatolian site, indicating the widespread manufacturing of cilices. Ian Hodder has argued that &quot;self-injuring clothing was an essential component of the Catalhöyük culturo-ritual entanglement, representing 'cleansing' and 'lightness'.&quot;

The legal profession has its origins in ancient Greece and Rome. Although in Greece it was forbidden to take payment for pleading the cause of another, the rule was widely flouted. After the time of Claudius, lawyers (iuris consulti) could practise openly, although their remuneration was limited. A skilled and regulated profession developed gradually during the late Roman Empire and the Byzantine Empire: advocates acquired more status, and a separate class of notaries (tabelliones) appeared


Mandrameen was a poet and Seculla was a trial lawyer.  The poet crafts verse and hopes that it will sing when played on the human heart, and the lawyer does the same, just does it more bluntly, with less rhyming and more certainty. Lives are at stake. “That’s the only real difference between us”, Seculla would say. That and the fact that a lawyer gets paid by the hour.
Often, when they laid together, Mandrameen would tease her about this. He’d say that if a lawyer is just a poet working for money, then a lawyer is no better than a whore. Money cheapens Virtue. A whore cheapens Love. A lawyer cheapens the Truth. He’d spank her on the bottom for effect.
Seculla would wave him off with her usual air of grace. She’d argue that there’s no such thing as the Truth. A single murder recounted by three different witnesses will result in three different stories. Unless there’s a bloody knife in hand we are all invincibly ignorant. Everything boils down to a he-said she-said, and everyone picks a side. You can’t blame them. It is only natural. Might as well get paid to do it.
It is little wonder that the two disagreed on how the Law should be structured. Mandrameen believed that morality was written on the hearts of men. He believed that Humans were endowed by Nature with natural rights. The Law should emanate from these and protect them. 
For Seculla, it didn’t matter what anyone thought the law should be, there’s only what it was: a practical thing for resolving the complexities of a dispute. It is subject to circumstance, politics, and power, and that’s all it will ever be. No one has anything by natural right. You only have what you can take for yourself. She’d say this right before grabbing a handful of Mandrameen’s ass - more for her own pleasure than effect. After all, the only law truly written on the heart is that of Self-Interest.
Perhaps if Seculla had been alive to see Ayram’s band, she might not have been so quick to doubt that Humanity has an intrinsic moral compass. Perhaps if Mandrameen had seen it, he might not have liked the direction that the compass's needle was pointing, for it didn’t point to Liberty or anything noble, it pointed to Ayram.

Templar - travelers deposited money at one church, recieved a  note, and withdrew it at another church - international banking. The fees made templars incredibly wealthy.


Philip desired to become the most christian king in europe, and he would stop at nothing to that end. Believes he is the face of christ on earth. He had been borrowing money from the templars to fight the english. Was desperately short of funds. On the verge of bankruptcy. Crusaders had no reason to exist anymore - the templars were vulnerable. Their banks full of crusader cash, and the king knew it. Philip had been devaluing the currency, and that led to an angry mob - chased him into a temple. It was there taht he saw some of the Templar’s treasure. He decided to neutralize the templars and stirp their assets. Only the pope could legitimately rule the order. THe king needed to destabilize them. 
Rumors about the templars were manipulated by PHillip IV. A kind of poison that Phillip used to damage the order. Then, having smeared their reputation, the king launched a surprise attack, and snagged every templar in Paris (Friday the 13th). The king attacked the secrecy of Templar initiations, suggesting deviant behaviour behind closed doors. Accused of financial corruption, and sodomy. Idolatry, including worshipping a cat - all added up to Heresy. This charge had the power to destroy the temple order.
Clement V - puppet pope to Phillip. His agents sent him many letters accusing him of Heresy - had affair with wife of a French nobleman. Reluctantly, Clement was the kings man. He wasn’t even allowed to go to the Vatican. But CLement managed to turn Phillip’s attack into a papal inquiry. Three cardinals went to Shinon prison - far from retracting confession of heresy, the same leaders repeated confessions to the pope’s men. Most of it related to templar initiation rites - The Latin Rule of the Templars - Kept in house - The initiate was asked if he wanted to be a serf and slave forever. If he consorted with women, he would be put in heavy iron, A psalm was said. TUnic presented. BUt shinon parchment says different - Denounce christ after formal rites. The brotherhood performed the ceremony, then took him aside, in the same chapel, and showed him a crucifix with an effigy of christ, and told him that he should not believe in the crucified, and should, in fact, denounce him. Spitting on the cross. Kiss him on the bottom of the back, then on the navel, then on the mouth. Abstain from women, join themselves with brothers of the order.

Eventually Phillip gave ultimatum - either Dissovle the order, or I will start a breakaway church of France. But templar sites had been emptied before Phillip could raid it. We don’t know where it went. Order recieved notice about Phillip’s plan. Boats disappeared. Nothing has been found to this day.


The templars became the super-heros of christianity. Originally a band of nine, their numbers soared. 
Bernard of clairvo- strong warriors on the one hand, and monks waging war with vice and demons on the other. A body of men who need have no fear. These men have no dread of death, confident that in the sight of the Lord, they would be his martyrs.

Torture. The rack was used on young and old. The Strapado - a wench that dropped the bound Templar from a height  and jerked him violently. Bernard’s feet were rubbed with fat and roasted over a fire until his bones slid out. He didn’t torture them so they told the truth. He tortured them so they told his truth.

Relics: sought and fought over, venerated across europe. Famous worldwide as custodians of relics. A templar’s signature alone was enough to prove a relic’s authenticity.

Mandrameen and Seculla first met at an evening river party. It was a government function, some Imperial Senator was entertaining some foreign dignitary, and so the wine was thin and the air was thick with ambition - not a place for depressed people. They don’t have the stamina for it. They filter through the pretension and settle down into one corner of the tent where they cluster together for sanity. That was where Seculla found Mandrameen.

Self defence - catholic church was wary of it, on the ground that it was egoistic action, undertaken by a person strictly for his own benefit rather than for that of the community,. As such, it was directly contrary to the divine command of the gospels to turn the other cheek- so that a christian who engaged in it imperilled his immortal self and risked eternal damation.

At the same time, though, individual self-defence was held to be permitted instead by natural law, which recognised a fundamental right of self-preservation as a ‘naturl’ or instinctive feature of the human species. Strictly speaking, states hd a natural-law right of self-defence tooo, against aggressors.
Because of its status as natural-law right, no permission required from any higher authority for its exercise. 

It was held by John of Legnano that heavenly bodies possessed no right of self-defence, apparently because they were not ‘receptive of foreign impressions’.
self -defense was seen as an exercise of a primeval right of survival under any and all conditions - a right possessed by wrongdoers as well as by champions of justice.
Preemptive action was permitted, when a foe was ‘bold and ready to strike’. Some slight tolerance for action after the fact as well.to strike back at his attacker even if there was no threat of a further blow. This was in the interest of allowing the victim to avoid ‘disgrace and humiliation’ or ‘dishonour and loss of face’. Or, action in hot pursuit to recover property immediately after a robbery.
In principle, the rule was that selfdefence served only the very limited purpose of fending off a blow in the course of delivery or preventing the consummation of an ongoing attack. 

SOme bishops held that killing was sinful, even in a just cause, adn that penance was therefore required. 

Battle of Hstings in 1066 - when the Norman bishops laid down an elaborate schedule of penances. Simply for fighting in a just war, a penance of three years was prescribed. One year of penance was required of a fighter for each enemy soldier that he knew that he hd killed. If a soldier struck an enemy but was unsure whether death had ensued or not, the penance was forty days. If the number of opponents that a soldier killed was not known, then there was to be penance of one day per week for the rest of the soldier’s life ( or the building or endowing of a church as a substitute). There was a special rule for archers, who shot from afar and naturally would not know the effects of their cts: penance for three Lents. THe most extreme sanction was reserved for those with the improper animus. THese killings were straightforward homicide (even if the cause was just), requiring seven years’ penance. Even the commander himself, Duke William of NOrmandy made amends for the conflict in the form the endowing of Battle Abbey, which still stands as a tangible monument to the force of the medieval law of just wars.

The purpose of war, it must always be remembered, was not the destruction of th enemy for its own sake but rather the obtaining of justice. This principle of necessity imported a balancing test - a weighing of the suffering caused by the war, against the military advantage at stake.

‘If an end is permissible, the necessary means to that end are also permissible’.

Janus-Faced - having two contrasting points of view.

Second Lateran COuncil of 1139, which ruled that there should be no molesting of certain categories of noncombatants, such as clerice, pilgrims, merchants, and peasants. Also: a flat prohibition against the us of ‘that murderous art of crossbowmen and archers’ in wars within the Christian world (These black arts continued to be permitted against infidel enemies.)

Medieval writers were fully aware that history and scripture were both replete with instances in which the wicked had vanquished the innocent on the field of battle. THis was explained in a variety of ways, such as by holding that God, acting in ways not fathomable by fallible humans, chose to allow evil-doers to prevail (presumably temporarily), possibly as a means of punishing evil acts committed on some prior occsion by the just side. But Power nd Right had no necessary connection whatsoever with one another. SO, just war was very different from a duel, in which two rivals agreed with one another in advance that the outcome of their combat would decide the issue between them and also preclude ny future quarrellingon the subject. Duelling was evil in that it converted a dispute of legal right into a mere contest of brute strength.

Victors must be just in their victory, must be scrupulously fair to his vanquished foe - must spurn temptation to extract unreasonable rewards for himself. No justification for plundering and robbing the unfortunate victims of defeat of all they possess.

Just-war writing always had  certain aura of artificiality, an intricacy and detail that appealed more naturally to the subtle debater or logician than to the battle-hardened general. Never, in short, has writing about war been so largely the province of people so far removed from the actual practice of the subject.

ON the whole, evidence of the impact of just-war thought on stat practice in the Middle AGes was decidedly modest. Realists will naturally find it especially difficult to believe that the principle of animus in particular was ever very much in evidence in medieval warfare. Even the principle of personae, in which the church might be thought to have taken a particular interest, was interpreted with an impressive degree of flexibility. E.G. Pope Jon X personally leading his forces to victory against Muslim armies in 915. IN 958, Pope John XII embarked on a decidedly un-holy military campaign against Capua and Benevento with a view to enlarging the papal domains. 

Law of Arms was in contrast a more practical law of warfare for the common soldier. Dealing with such matters as ransom arrangements for prisoners, taking and dividing of spoils, truces and safe-conducts and so forth. 

For the most part, medieval warfare presented a shocking picture of horror and brutality. There were relatively few pitched battles. A more typical method of warfare was the chevauche’e, whcih was a raiding expedition by mounted soldiers, dedicated to the destruction of crops, pillaging of property and general weakening of the enemy’s war-making capacity. Further scope for suffering by civilians was offered by the euphemistically named ‘free companies’ of soldiers, who hired themselves out to the highest bidder during war - commonly turning their hnds, with remarkable nimbleness, to free-lance plundering during times of peace or truce. These bodies were also known, with ominous accuracy, as les e’corcheurs ( scorchers). Nor did activities of free-ranging knights always measure up to the high standards o the medieval romances. Saint Peter Damian ( a bishop of Ostia in the eleventh century), for example, grumbled that the swords wielded by knights errant had created more widows and orphans than they had protected. By the end of the sixteenth century, knighthood had sunk to the leel of satire at the hands of miguel de cervantes.

Letter of reprisal - seize property of foreign national from whose countrymen stole something from you.
The wrong being remedied was not the original theft, but rather the subsequent denial of justice - a failure for which the foreign stat was responsible, and by extension, all of its members. The solace of these innocent sufferers, for what it was worth, was that they were entitled to be indemnified by the original wrongdoer, whom they could pursue in the courts of their own country. 
Period of grace before the seizures could begin. Another common limitation on reprisals ws the exemption of certain categories of persons or property from them. Church property was typically exempted. Also travellers, pilgrims, ambassadors, and the like, as well as merchants attending fairs. It was also common for foreign nationals who were permanent residents of the issuing state to be exempted. Scholars were frequently exempted too. 
Once the reprisal process was underway it was subject to continuing judicial oversight. Property that was seized had to be brought before officials, who would certify that it fell within the terms of the reprisal grant. 
Reprisal is a delegation to the letter holder of a portion of his ruler’s sovereign powers - i.e., the ruler’s right to determine the distribution of property amongst persons located in the territory over which his sovereign powers extended.
Letters of Mark - like letter of reprisal but for the the frontier ‘Mark’.
Catholic Church, most notably, was against letters of reprisal as oppressive and contrary to the laws and natural equity.

Hugo Grotius, in his famous treatise ON the Law of War and Peace, publishind in 1625. Law of nations in careful contrast to the older law of nature, which had dominated international legal thought throughout the Middle Ages. Two outstanding features that distinguished it - first that it focussed on the rights and duties of stats as such, and applicable only to them. Second, concentrate on the external actions of states and thereby to forgo considerations of good faith and mental attitude and the like.
This was the emancipation of statecraft in general, including international law, from the principles of interpersonal morality. 
THe pioneering figure was Machiavelli, whose name became a byword for depravity amongst moralists. He was the first to stress, in the most straightforward terms, the view that the qualities that made for successful stewardship of a state were not (to put it mildly) the same as those for gaining entrance to the kingdom of Heaven. Statecraft was increasingly becoming a science in this period, with the central concern being the dispassionate identification of the corporate interest of the state as such - followed by the rational and single minded devotion to the promotion of that interest. 
Doctrines and methods derived not from broad principles of morality but from a coldly unsentimental analysis of human political life as it was actually lived. Buttom up instead of the ‘top down’ character of natural law. 
Law of Nations vs Law of Nature co-existed and interwove into what we now call natural law.


Emmerich de Vattel, practising diplomat as well as a treatise writer. The Law of Nations, 1758, treatment of international law in its dualistic form. A great deal mor stress on the law of nations - or ‘voluntary’ law as he termed it. 

The world ‘soldier’ derives from the Latin ‘solidus’, a roman gold coin, indicating the tie between military service and the payment of a wage.

THis shift to the law of nations from law of nature issued a shift in professionalism in warfare, including a shift towards standing armies. These standing armies encouraged moderation in many ways in warfare. Uniforms to distinguish combatants from ambient populace. So expensive that rulers were loath to take undue risks with them. Generals often avoided pitched battles where possible because of the risk of the destruction of their forces at a fell swoop. As an alternative, war of manoeuvre became the standard strategy, with thegoal being to place one’s troops in enemy territory, so as to compel the enemy to bear the brunt of supporting them. Also moderating: comparative uniformity of military strength amongst the major European powers; only modest scope for territorial gains or losses.

Hamilton: “formerly, an invading army would penetrate into the heart of a neighbouring country almost as soon as intelligence of its approach could be received… The history of war, in that quarter of the globe, is no longer a history of nations subdued and empires overturned; but of towns taken adn retain; of battles that decide nothing, of retreats more beneficial than victories; of much effort and little acquisition.

This was the Age of Calculation more than the Age of Reason. With the goal being the maximisation of the national interest. THe ethos of the period was therefore relentlessl utilitarian, with little place for sentiment, moralism, or ideology. ALliances were formed and dissolved in a kind of perpetual stately waltz, danced to the lilting strains of the Eurpoean balance of power. Exemplifying the new style of rulership, near to the point of caricature, was that veritable crown prince of eighteenth-centry political rationalists, the ustrian Count Kaunitz-Rittberg. He boasted of his mastery of the arcan art of ‘political algebra’ which enabled him, with the unerring certainty of the mathematician, to thread his way through the intricate diplomatic mazes of the time. War took on the aura of a chess game, particularly in the northwestern part of Europe, with its flat terrain, network of canals, dense clustering of rich cities and chains of fortressess. 
It was a depressingly materialistic time, with no ideological divides, no great causes, no spirit of heroic self-sacrifice. In the practice of states, if not the ruminations of scholars, the just-war ethos was very little in evidence. Cynical statesmen had little trouble conjuring up a cause for war whenever one was needed.

Voltaire:

	A genealogist proves to a prince that he is the direct descendant of a count whose relatives had mde  family pact three or for hundred years ago with a house whose very nme has left no memory. THis house had remote pretensions to a province whose last owner had just died of apoplexy. The prince and his council conclude without difficulty that the province belongs to him by divine right. THis province, which is some hundreds of leagues distant, protests in vain that it does not know him, that it has no wish to be governed by him, that one must at least have a people’s consent before legislateing for it. These discourses do not even reach the ears of the prince whose rights are incontestable. He immediately finds a great number of men who have nothing to do nor to lose. He dresses them in heavy blue cloth at 110 sous the ell, puts a heavy white cord round their hats, makes them turn left and right, and marches to glory.

According to Vattle, actual state practice was scarcely less absurd than this. He maintained that the war between france and the netherlands in 1672 resulted from the irritation of the French King, Louis XIV, over the issuing of certain medals and the spreading of offensive jokes.

Hobbes - frank acceptance of the ways of power politics. Rejected natural law principle that peace is the normal condition of interstate relations. There is only the single quest for security in a brutally hostile world.

Vs.

Contractual viewpoint - war as a duel between states, entered into by mutual consent, thereby justifying the alternate label of the ‘duelling’ view of war. 

The comes the first forays of Total War in the napoleonic era.

_____It seems like law si the ‘narrative making mechanism of the nation’ in the way the we are the story we tell ourselves.

Grotius - a decision to resort to war is just if it consist in the execution of a right, nand unjust if it consists in the execution of an injury. - father of international law

Law of nations - legal relationships between nation states was of a particular character, qualitatively different from those governing interpersonal contacts. Previously, law applicable to humn relations, the jus gentium (or ‘law of peoples’) had been seen as merely a sub-category of the general, all-encomapassing law of nature.

The source of this new body of law lay in the conscious will of the states themselves. Instead of being handed down from above, it welled up from below, blossoming out of the practices of the countries of the world.


Vitoria - “Invincible error” of “Invincible Ignorance”: a state of affairs in which it ws not possible, even with the best efforts, to discover where justice actually lay in the case at hand. Strictly speaking, it was still the case that one party would have a justa causa while the other would not. But the war would nonetheless be just on both sides in the limited sense that both sides were free of blame. 
	Note: perhaps primarily this concept was applied to peoples would could not possibly have heard the word of God and so lived in a state of invincible ignorance

Grotious applied law of nations to situations where war between states was one of invincible doubt. Voluntary law would look not to the substantive justice of the legal claims but instead to a definite formality in the conduct of war. “ If the enemy observes all the rules of formal warfare, we are not to b e heard in complaint of him as a violator of the law of nations; he has the same right as we to assert a just cause; and our entire hope lies in victory or a friendly settlement.”

NOTE: vvvvvv this is ubermensh mindset_____
Under Natural law, no one is liable for the deeds of another person. Such vicarious liability was  feature exclusively of hte voluntary law. War entails the killing of persons not on the basis of any personal wrongdoing but merely because of their membership of the enemy armed force. The core defining feature of war as opposed to other conflict is that it consists of this secondary, rather than primary action. TThe effect was to open the way for treating war in a more flexible manner than before, as a man-made institution whose rules could be crafted - and recrafted as necessary - by human beings to serve their own purposes. The law of war was transplanted from heaven to earth. This is in contrast to medieval war, in which all enemies were considered to be wrongdoers in their own right, in the sense that all of them were held to have made a conscious choice to associate themselves with their leader’s cause. Grotious discarded this notion of universal personal responsibility. A mere ‘obstinate devotion to one’s party’, in Grotius’s view, was not in itself cause for punishment.
Grotius distinguished state of war on one hand, and ‘its actos’ on the other. A state of war can exist even in the absence of any acts of war on the part of either side. Contrary to medieval doctrine, which had seen war in terms of individual coercive acts or operations occurring within a state of peace that was permanently in force.

In the course of its development, muslim jurisprudence came to distinguish between three different levels of officially administered violence. First is fully fledged foreign war, which was known as Akham al-Hiraba. Second was war against internal insurgents - i.e., within the Muslim community - known as Akham al-Bughat. At the lowest level was state violence or coercion in the form of routine law enforcement, known as Akham al-Tariq. 

_Absense of belief that the natural condition of international affairs was one of peace. It held the opposite view: that, between the community of the faithful and the infidel world, there was inevitable and perpetual enmity, comparable to teh never-ending natural condition of war between the greek and barbarian worlds. The infidel world was even known as the Dar al-Harb, meaning ‘house of war’ in araic, in contrast to the muslim world or Dar al-Islam (‘house of Islam’), which was the abode of peace and harmony.


No specific wrong-doing was required on the part o the infidels to justify war against them. 

Infidels were allowed to retain their own religions provided that they refrained from disturbing the peace of the community and that they submitted to certain civil disabilities such as liability for extra taxation.

The idea of endemic warfare between the muslim and infidel worlds naturally made it virtually impossible to devise any body of rules for determining when a transition from peace to war was justified. A lack of moral community between muslims and infidels hindered this progress.

Two characteristics in particular distnguished the two types of miscreant. First, bughat(zealot) were animated by a doctrine or belief of some kind and not merely by greed for plunder. THe doctrine held might be misguided or heretical, but the important point was that the bughat fought as a patriot for a cause. The second was that a bughat group was the possession of some kind of internal organisational struccture of  a governmental or qusi-governmental nature. Maybe the form of a disciplined fighting arm comparable to a regular military force, or the effective possession of a territory in which the insurgents exercised de facto sovereign powers such as taxation or handing down judicial decisions.

Conversely christians believed that the ‘natural’ state of the world is one of peace, with war as an exceptional and perverse state of affairs requiring some kind of explicit justification. THe entire world was the ‘house of peace’ with no such thing as a ‘house of war’.

The most immediate practical question was one of personal ethics: whether individual Christians could, or should, perform military service. The predominant view of the early CHurch fathers, most notably of Tertullian, was that they should not, on the authority of the gospel teachings. Gradually this position was modified as a result of several factors. ON was an increasing tendency of Christian writers to see the Roman Empire as a divinely approved political vehicle for the furthering of the Christian fatihe and the safeguarding of civilisation i general. Even the most devout Christians could appreciate the value ofa vigilant and disciplined military force against enemies of the faith...Consequently, Christian writers began to stress the virtues of defending the broader community, and the faith itself, against external foes. IT becamecommon for them to lavish praise onto the ROman state nd military as a model (or at least a potential model) of disciplined and devoted community service. Saint ambrose of Milan, writing in the late fourth century, lauded ‘the virtue which leads people to protect their country form barbarians in time of war, or which in peacetime makes them defend the weak or protect their friends from robbers’. Even Tertullian, the most pacifistically inclined of the Church fathers, stressed that Christians prayed dutifully for the ROman emperors and their armiers. In much the same vein, Christian writers also began to stress the positive values of the law-enforcement activities of magistrates against internal wrongdoers. No less an authority than Sait Paul praised magistrates as Go’s agents, labouring on behalf of the community at large - agents whose tasks naturally included the distasteful, bu tnecessary, chore of punishing wrongdoers… THese tendencies were summed up by Augistine of Hippo. He explained that the gospel exhortation to pacifism should be understood as a limitation only n the purposes for which force could be used. In particular, the gospels forbade only the use of force for egoistical ends. THe position was very different, however, when force was employed altruistically, to protect others - i.e. to safeguard the community of faithful from its oppressors and enemies. That was a praiseworthy public service… Good men, he contended, could wage war for the purpose of ‘bringing under the yoke the unbridled lusts of men’ and for rooting out of vice.
Aquinas- There was no sin, he insisted, following Augustine, in resorting to force when ‘comissioned by another’ for the common good.



HERE we see who christianity goes from being radical pacificst - the door is opened by state power combined with the notion of helping others who are being struck down by violence, if not themselves. “IF you are struck, present your side. But if another is struck, you have license to kill.”

Women, children, the aged, infirm are excluded from the dictates of nature. Ecclesiastics, whose professional calling was held to be incompatible with the shedding of blood. (Clerics were forbidden to practise surgery)

The war must have  well-defined objective ; e.g. title of territory. - No such thing as endemic conflict (no such thing as house of pease vs. house of war)

Augustine - just war was, “one that avenges wrongs, when a nation or state has to be punished for refusing to make amends for the wrongs inflicted by its subjects or to restore what it has 
seized unjustly’.

Final criterion of just war - animus - war must be waged not out of hatred but out of love, for the purpose of correcting evil and briniging the enemy to the path of righteousness. - Subjective or mental counterpart of justa causa…. Distinctively christian, since it functioned as the key means of reconciling the christian duty of universal love with the rsort to force.

To Augustine, nothing was more reprehensible than, “The real evils in war, love of violence, revengeful cruelty, fierce and implacable enmity, wild resistance, and the lust of power and such like’.

War must be waged, if at all, with reluctance, out of regrettable necessity and with a certain benevolent severity’.
Augustine - like a father applying corporal punishment to  a son for corrective purposes, with a motive of love.

War is not opposed to love of one’s enemies; for whoever wages war honourable hats, not individuals, but the ations which he justly condemns’.

For the crusades to the holy land, the justa causes was the unlawful occupation of the holy land by muslim aggressors, who proceeded to compound their sins by interfering with the access of christian pilgrims to the holy plces.

If a war is just, there is no such thing as neutrality.

Just War/ cause/ animus being manipulated to steal and oppress. Liberalism and freedom used by evil hedge funds to craft conset and laws to support them. It just works out so great in your head, then when implemented, the roaches find all the cracks and make them wider. Fear is the only thing that will ever keep them in line.

To be a simple creature is to have sense, need, and impulse. To be human is to have an awareness of the future. To act human is to organize the future. To live human, then, is to work long and hard to shape a chain of cause and effect that might, when casted out into the void,  latch on to a more desirable world. It’s a largely futile endeavor; the vast majority of humans have only ever nicked the future; perhaps they caught a lover, or some temporary measure of peaceableness. Nonetheless, the stories of true successes are intoxicating. The very knowledge that one person might move mountains makes life itself, and by extension their own, worth it.

IN SItuations of endemic or constant conflict between two peoples, such a contrast is not possible, any more than a science of meteorology would be possible in a society in which the weather never varied. In such a case, war would be, in a certain conceptual sense, invisible by virtue of its very ubiquity (Can use analogy of light/and dark, if you only live in the dark, you would have no word for it).

The Arabs had a specific label for endemic conflic consisting of interminable raiding and counterraiding: razzia, which they clearly distinguished from formal war.

Precolonial Aftrica, the Fante sent a herald to the enemy to declare war, sometimes even to arrange the time and place of battle. Nigerian peoples indicated teh existence of war by laying plantain leaves and piles of powder and shot on paths that would be travelled by their enemies-to-be. - Michoaca - priest burned a number of balls of tobacco, tow men dispatched to place two balls of tobacco and blood-stained arrows and some eagle feathers, in the territory of the enemy. Aztecs famously sent series of missions to request surrender before war, suppying their enemies with weapons, and foregoing any possibility of surprise.

For the greeks, they sent heralds to sing declaration of war. Overtime, the mere presence of a herald signaled war.

“If you call it life,” Ralph continued, “it’s gotta be killing something, doesn’t it? Anything can die. I can crush a rock with my hammer and I can crush a bug with my hammer, yet we say the rock is a thing and the bug is a life. Why? Because the bug kills other bugs. That’s how you know they’re alive. It’s the killing and the eating.” That last word rolled through Ralph’s beard like a saw.

Ralph just shrugged. “I say it’s killing. If these trees are alive, then that means they’re killing something. Could be it’s us.

Indeed this is the only *real* difference between myself and you. This leads to different behavior. Different, but better?

War is a public and collective enterprise, arraying a whole people against a foreign foe. It is an exercise in social solidarity of the highest order. It is an error to think of it in terms of turbulence, confusion and anarchy. These factors may be present to be sure, perhaps in generous measure. But warfare calls for careful planning, preperation of many kinds - psychological, spiritual, logistical, and so forth - as well as rational execution. It is scientific

To wind the world in unison with him?

When on the spindle, spun to endless distance,
By Nature’s listless hand the thread is twirled,
And the discordant tones of all existence
In sullen jamgle are together hurled,
Who, then, the changeless orders of creation
Divides, and kindles into rhythmic dance?
Who brings the One to join the general ordination,
Where it may throb in grandest consonance?
Who bids teh storm to passion stir the bosom?
In brooding souls the sunset burn above?
Who scatters every fairest April blossom
Along the shining path of Love?
Who braids teh noteless leaves to crowns, requiting
Desert with fame, in Action’s every field?
Who makes Olympus sure, the Gods uniting?

Kamandaka - 4th century. Sixteen different types of war, classified according to the results sought or achieved, the causes, the character of the parties engaged and so forth. 

Violent conflict between collectives instead of individuals.
Waged against foreign peoples instead of domestic enemies
Rule-governed activity
Boundary between times of war and times of peace.

American indians had person -to -person conflict, but lacked any idea or practice of organised, collective combat. War is not a universal feture of the human condition.

Ares is often said to have been the god of war of ancient Greece, but this is not correct. His actual sphere of activity was violence o fthe interpersonal sort such as the wreaking of vengeance. Homer had him denounced by Athena as a bloodthirsty marauder, and by Hera as a mindless bully who knows no law… Warfare as an organised, disciplined, rationally conducted collective activity was the sphere of Athena, portrayed with a helmet and breastplate.Inimicus vs. hostis. Personal conflict vs. social conflict.

Plato - valour and bravado are not the principal traits sought in civilised warriors. What is needed is a cool-headed and disciplined devotion to the community interest. Never do anything except by combined and united action as members of a group.

Norse - older god was Tiw, who was counterpart of athena. Odin, who was fierce, fanatical, and heroic.

Indra, chief of the vedic gods. A mighty hero, vanquisher of monsters and the like. Vs. Skanda, organised hosts to victory. Discipline and chastity. 

China - Chi You = ares, anarchic violence, personal revenge and chaos. Yellow Emperor, the use of force on behalf of the community.

Obedience, patience, cooperation and discipline. 
Times of peace and prosperity threaten the moral helth of the body buy tempting people to neglect these qualities. 
Aristotle - war as a force for nurturing the key virtues of justice and restraint. 

Robbespierre- virtue without terror is impotent.

Cicero - a criminal band is not an enemy proper. An enemy state in wartimre was the foe only with the country with which it was at war, whereas the pirate was the common foe of all. Formal process for declaring war against organised foreign states, not against barbarians, brigans, pirates or the like. No obligation to keep faith with you, whereas there is for state enemies. 

Some criminal bands were large and unorganized. Latrociniae. Powerful and require militar scale. Operation could be mounted en masse, without any need for the scrupulous provision of proof of guilt. 

There is no such thing as a foreign society. There are barbarians on the bargain to be sure, but these are simply dark corners to which the light of chinese civilisation had, as yet, penetrated only partially. It is law enforcement, not war.

Daoist war god Guan Ui - began his career as a mortal, a general Ifirst a beancurd seller) in the disorderly period. Promotion to divine not for valour or destructiveness alone, but also for mercy, wisdom, loyalty and discipline. Wise man of action. 

Individual concerns must be subordinated to the broader social interest. (Without this pressure, it would never occur. Society would slowly and gradually fragment as the generations lost their).Social entropy. ---why do people become stupid when in groups? They subject their will to the state. Extinction of the self in the community.

Pyetle notes

Ibn-Kaldoun - 14th century - Berber state being like a garden
There is no justice without the monarch. No Monarch without the army. No army without taxes. No taxes without wealth. No wealth without justice.	

They say she does not dance in time.
Then it is time that is at fault.

War a majestic constant throughout history across cultures. A protean thing, changing its fce throughout the course of recorded history in response to a dizzying array of factors. War so routine, so widely accepted, as to assume something of the character of a sporting contest or a ritual. An institution of international law.

Things do not evolve through some kind of wholly innate dynamic in the manner of an embryo developing steadily along a predictable path into a person or an acorn into an oak tree. Indeed, even embryos must be nourished and acorns provided with soil and water.

Specific rules about war have never existed in a vacuum. It is the deep-seated conceptions about the nature and role of war in international relations.

Assassinations, ruses and perfidy.

The eternal struggle between agricultural and nomadic ways.

At some point war ceased to be regarded as natural or inevitable and came instead to be seen as a matter of conscious human choice. Migrated from the realm of instinct, or of divine command, to the domain of reason. Two separate gods of war : Ares vs. Athena. From that time onward, it became necessary to think about war - about offensive war, as a purposive activity.  (instead of border friction). Why embark upon war instead of remain at peace.

Confucian: War as a means of last resort, to counteract antisocial conduct and reinforce the norms which integrated the society into a harmonious whole.

Natural law - the entire world was under the rule of a single universal, transcultural set of moral principles. War was a handmaiden of justice. It’s purpose is not conquest or revenge or glory, but the vindication of the rule of law.

Cynicism, greed, and brutality have a wider field of play.

Christian knights indulged in a horrible massacre in liberating the tomb of their saviour, who had urged all men to turn the other cheek when smitten.

Misty beginnings up to the year 1600.

Dominant legal framework was that of natural law, with war seen primarily as a means of enforcing that law. Wars were fought on earth, but for purposes made in heaven.

1600-1815, metamorphosis of war from a tool of God into a tool of men. Law relating to war had a distinctly dualistic character - partly of nature, partly of culture. Wars were perfect if decked out in the fullest and most formal array, and otherwise imperfect.

War as clash of rival international interests rather than pursuit of heavenly ideals or more mundanely, the rule of law. A laissez-faire era, with war so firmly ensconced as a routine feature fo life that it unblushingly accorded the honourable status as an institution of international law.

Modern reversion to the medieval just-war outlook.Harness war and justice more tightly together than ever before. The deth of war as a legal institution. But war was dispiritingly tenacious.

Just as within a state some lawful power to punish crimes is necessary to preservation of domestic peace; so in the world as a whole, there must exist, in order that various states may dwell in concord, some power for the punishment of injuries inflicted by one state upon another; and this power is not found in any superior.- Fransisco Sua’rez

The earliest instances of collective armed struggle predate recorded history, and so remain the subject of speculation rather than of settled fact. Indeed, if the Christian st



A depression is just a bit of land that’s a little lower than the surrounding area. It can vary in size, but if you’re walking along, you’ll get through it in good time with no great effort. It’s just a phase in what is otherwise perfectly healthy, normal, level ground. It’s not a mountain whose peak is hidden in a blizzard. It’s not a grey and stormy ocean whose innumerable waves wrap around the horizon. It’s not an endless desert filled only with mirages that flicker just out of reach. It’s just, you know, a shallow dip in the road. You might not even notice it.
Suffice to say, a depression is not very depressing, and that’s why Pyetle hated the word. He thought it was prejudicial to use the same word to describe both a dimple of land and his own private psychological desolation. It gave well-put-together people the wrong idea about him; made them feel that they understood where he was coming from. After all, everyone’s been sad, so everyone’s been through a little depression, so everyone thinks they’ve got the place mapped; but a really meaty nihilistic stupor, well Pyetle knew it wasn’t on any goddamn map. It was perfectly reasonable for someone to get lost there and never find their way out.
Some people are born there. Whether by nature or nurture they are trapped in that dimension at the earliest age. Pyetle was such a creature, and as such he knew that he was destined to lead a life unlived - whether it be by suicide or apathy or distraction. He reasoned he was old enough now at forty-two to opt for suicide - as what little in the way of pleasure his life could offer, it must have offered by now. So three days ago he began to drink, and he did not stop until late on the second night, when his stockpile of wineskins were emptied. He then slept, then woke an hour later in a sweat and vomited what seemed to him to be the whole of his stomach, and then promptly went back to sleep.
On the third day he rose again, this time to wander the streets of Jeket aimlessly until final inspiration took him.
